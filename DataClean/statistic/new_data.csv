13781312,10,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,"I finally tried Antico!! And it lived up to the hype and absolutely loved it! 



Traditional Neapolitan style pizza, and apparently the ingredients are actually flown in from Italy, as well as the pizza ovens themselves. The space is open and you can see the kitchen at work from the main dining area. There's a spot to grab toppings (think sea salt, garlic, parmesan and crushed red peppers) and olive oil for dipping in the kitchen area. 



We had the Margherita D.O.P and the Diavalo. The salami and peppers are a perfect combo on the Diavalo, and just the right amount of spicy. Fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes on both, which obviously. I also grabbed a Limonata to complete the experience and think back to my recent afternoon Italian escapades. If you're into more traditional pizza, this is THE spot to go in the ATL."
,,,,,,,,,"Sooo... this place may not be for me. I visited this place because someone told me that he drove a few additional hours just to stop by this pizza place again. We ordered San Gennaro, which came with salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, and cipolline. We all liked this one much better than the other one. The other pizza that we had was Diavola. Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me. Our pizza crust was way too burnt for both pizza - I doubt that's how they should be. This definitely made the pizza taste not as great... 



Antico seemed to be a popular hang out place - saw many people brought alcohol on their own. Overall, it was an okay experience for me and the pizza was priced on the expensive side. I am not sure I'd be coming again."
,,,,,,,,,"Authentic Italian pizza. Limited choices. It's a a local favorite. Very fast service. Good for college students or take out. You can see the the cooks making the pizza, the kitchen is right by the seating area. 



The pizza is quite big so be cautious of how many pizzas you are ordering ."
,,,,,,,,,"Quick Pizza master class - there are several types of pizza (excluding deep crust): 

Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico) 

Italian fusion - slightly thicker, breadier crust than tradition and combines American and Italian (i.e. Fellinis) 

American - generally thick-ish crust, cheezy, loaded with toppings (i.e. gameday Papa Johns). 

*there are other pizza types but this is a rough categorization without getting too granular (new york, chicago, etc.) 



Antico's makes some of the best traditional Italian pizza's you'll get in Atlanta with flavorful toppings served fresh and hot from their wood fired ovens. The atmosphere is chill and don't forget to get some toppings (peppers, parm, dipping oil etc.)."
,,,,,,,,,"The atmosphere of this restaurant alone deserves five stars. I really felt like I was back in Italy when we ate at the large communal tables near the pizza ovens, watching them stretch out the dough. Even the menu was in euros and drinks were all bottled. 



The pizza was super good, perfect amount of crispiness. They use big hunks of mozzarella. The pizza with roasted red pepper was amazing, I could eat it all day. 

I also loved how they have a little bar of ""toppings"" red peppers, garlic, spicy sauce, parm cheese, and olive oil. This place is awesome!!"
,,,,,,,,,"what.an .experience ugh! I def don't understand the hype about this place. Where do I begin? 



When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. 



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes. 



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time. 



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine. 



I just won't come here again. It's just not my type of place, but to each is own."
,,,,,,,,,"I love Antico pizza. The crust is delightfully thin and crispy. The cheese is not overwhelming and the toppings are although limited, very well paired. I can easily eat half a large pizza in one seating. My current favorite is the san gennaro. I love how the sweet peppers balance the salty sausage. Best part about this location is the BYOB. Make sure to come snag a table early if you have a group. This place gets packed fast (although they do move the line fast too)! Make sure to go next door and grab a cannoli at their cafe! 



Parking: Easy. In the back and side parking."
,,,,,,,,,"Impressed. Great thin, oven-baked pizza at a great venue. The place is BYOB and you order at the counter. Feel free to drink wine if the line is long, they provide plastic cups. 



After you order, half the kitchen is reserved for guest seating. Pick a table. The pizza came out in minutes shockingly. We ordered 4 pizzas for 7 people and it was plenty. $20 ish dollars apiece. 



The diavolo was my fav. I liked the red peppers they had. As we were eating, the workers were throwing pizzas around and baking them in one of three ovens. 



I wish there was a place like this in San Francisco!"
,,,,,,,,,"Plain and simple, Antico Pizza dishes up what must be some of the best pizza in Atlanta, and it was very much on par with some of my favorite spots in the country. 



Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? 



If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted. 



Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? 



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted. 



Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? 



This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted. 



Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could? 



This is a close one, but I ever so slightly prefer DeSano Pizza to Antico, and Antico falls just short of my top spot Tony's in San Francisco. No Star Granted."
,,,,,,,,,"I consider myself a pizza connoisseur. Like, I make it once a week. I'm really into it. I love ALL pizza, as everyone does, but of course there are those special pies that you always lean back on as a reference for ""great pizza"". Antico did that. 



The verdura pizza is what called our names. It came out fairly fast, with all kinds of great add ons. I can't talk about the food until I talk about the atmosphere though. 



You walk in and order at a counter. It's hot and loud and somehow extremely endearing. There are about 8-10 pizza options, all Neapolitan style. This place is very cafeteria style and is BYOB, so grab your wine. Glasses are on the table. 



Alright back to food. The pizza comes out on a big baking sheet, fresh out of the over. The Verdura comes with broccoli rabe for a nice green, shrooms for a nice meaty flavor, cherry tomatoes for that umami pop we all love, and buffalo moz to hold it all together. 



My gosh y'all this was the best pizza I've ever had. It was so familiar yet so complex tasting, unlike any pizza I've ever had. For the price, it's unbeatable. Please come and eat til you can't eat any longer."
14993473,3,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"we specifically came here to try their pizza that everybody is talking about, but left kind a disappointed. Pizza was average, nothing special, had that burned taste, we wanted to try margarita pizza with sausage or prosciutto, but they said that they can not mix two flavors, we have to buy two pizzas... I mean how hard it is to sprinkle prosciutto on one side of pizza.. girls who were working over there was very rude, was talking with each other in front of customers, we felt so welcomed. It's sad that we expected so much but left disappointed. Sorry.."
,,,,,,,,,"Holy yum. Wow, wow, wow. No other pizza tastes the same after eating here. 



We came on a Saturday around 11:30. They do not open until noon, so we had to wait in line outside. They brought out a sample pizza for all of us in line to have, which I greatly appreciated. It was so delicious it made me want to beat down the door even more. 



Once we were inside we quickly found a seat because there is little seating inside. It is great to sit at communal tables with loud, instrumental music blaring while the employees are tossing pizza dough into the air. 



We had the mushroom truffle pizza that was on special. It was close to $30, but holy hell it was worth every penny. You definitely got the truffle taste. Everything was so fresh. I often feel skimped on the truffle, not this time. 



I also love the fresh Parmesan, peppers, and other ingredients they leave out for you to dress every pizza bite with. 



Probably the best pizza I've ever had."
,,,,,,,,,"This. Is. The. Best. Pizza. Ever. Period. 



Not much more to say. I have eaten pizza all over the US and Europe, Italy included. Antico's is just that great. You order at the counter and proceed to find a seat. They have two sides to their menu, Rosso or Bianche pizza (think red / white). The pizzas are designed to be ordered as is, no substitutions, and frankly you wouldn't want to. The San Gennaro is probably the favorite. The ingredients translate to sausage, sweet peppers, cheese, and onions. Also tried and true deliciousness: lasagna pizza and Margherita with pepperoni. Flavors are just right. 



Now besides the amazing cheeses and fresh ingredients, the dough is the star. The pizzas are cooked in their pizza oven giving the dough the perfect doughy, soft, charred and textured consistency- its heaven on earth. I literally eat at least 4 slices. 



Now seating is community style and basically in the kitchen. Gives the place a totally different feel. You can grab fresh garlic, cheese, red pepper flakes or oil and bring to your table. Also, you can BYOB (awesowe!) 



This place is a must try for everyone. Just go!"
4190811,18,5,10,10,10,10,9,9,"Absolutely amazing!! I love this place so much, the pizza is just phenomenal. 



They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max. 

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves. 



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D 



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance! 



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens. 



Please visit this place at least once, you won't regret it!"
,,,,,,,,,"Antico is hands down, the best pizza place in Atlanta. It's my family's favorite pizza restaurant to eat at and we come here every time my brother and I are back in town. I've had the Margherita and the Sophia and they are both delicious. I judge a pizza place by their Margherita because it's a simple pizza that should be done right and Antico did a great job with the Margherita. The Sophia, which is bufala, cipollini onions, roasted mushrooms, and white truffle oil, has a ton of flavor and is a great pizza for vegetarians. 



I've also been to the Alpharetta location and I thought it was just as good. The Avalon is a fun area to walk around, so I think it's a great location for the restaurant."
,,,,,,,,,"Best pizza I have ever had, period. We got the lasagna pizza, the spinach/brocolli pizza, and a pepperoni with peppers pizza (I don't remember the actual unique names they give them). They all were absolutely delicious, the pizza is of true Italian origin. Light sauce, cheese is spread out not just thrown all over the pizza, same goes for the other toppings. Crust was amazing, it's baked in a wood oven so the slight smoked charcoal taste on the crust was absolutely amazing. 



The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy. 



Price, this is where I take off one star. It is expensive!!! The pizza is really good like I said, but does $24+ a pizza warrant that, i'm not so sure it does. The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think they throw $20+ worth of it on the pizza. 



Would I go back? Yes, but only if it's a work outing and the company is paying, cause if you get two pizzas you're looking at $50! Ah! The pizza is absolutely delicious though, if you haven't been, go and splurge at least one here."
,,,,,,,,,"Best pizza I've ever had. Been around the world, across Italy, from Rome to Naples, Amalfi, Capri San Marino, Pisa, Cinque Terre, Verona, Milan, Venice and more; and never and NOWHERE have we had pizza as good as Antico's. The quality of the ingredients, the dough, the toppings, the ambiance. I don't even really like pizza and I can't get enough of Antico. Free parking if you can find a spot. The line may be long, but it moves quickly. Service is fast. They have beer and wine. Eat your pizza anywhere-- inside, outside by Amalfi bar and gelato place across the street, on a stoop or in your car. 

--- you're welcome!"
,,,,,,,,,"My first time here and ordered the Margherita pizza with pepperoni as well as the Sophia. We sat across the street at the cafe and the pizza was out in a flash it seemed! Atmosphere was fun and the patio was busy. I enjoyed the Margherita pizza but the Sophia was not my favorite. $27 for a pizza seems like a lot too. 



After pizza, I ordered gelato- Peanut Butter Cup. It was smooth and creamy, very good! Also ordered Caramel Cheesecake. The cheesecake was very dense and rich, only a few bites and we were done. 



We were a party of 4 and took home half a pizza and the cheesecake."
,,,,,,,,,"An authentic, hidden gem in Atlanta. This is my favorite pizza place! Why spend $20 on dominos when you can get this authentic Italian pizza for the same price?? 



Food: This pizza is rustic, wholesome and so satisfying. The San Gennaro is a classic if you like meat and a little spice. For something a little more mild, I love the Pomodorini. You truly cannot go wrong. 



Environment: So fast! Moments after sitting down you'll have your pizza. Order to-go or take a seat. There's extra seating in the back. Also hidden in the back by the kitchen you'll find fresh garlic, Parmesan, crushed red pepper, etc. They have drinks but you can also BYOB. 



Tip: After enjoying your pizza, be sure to walk across the street for some delicious gelato!!"
,,,,,,,,,"Atmosphere: 4 stars = picnic table seating with full open kitchen views, BYOB and parking 



Service: 1 star = on a Monday around 4ish two cashiers are more interested in complaining about not being able to wear shorts to work than helping me translate the menu 



Food: 1 stars = Where do I begin? 

1- you cant pick out your toppings and are basically at the mercy of the menu...cant even split toppings 

2- pizza was bland and crust was burned 

3- mediocre at best 



Pros: veggies were fresh and pizza too hot 

Overall it was nice to try a new place but it wasn't worth $20 so I wont be back again"
,,,,,,,,,"The first time I've dined at Antico was back in 2009 as a college student. I remember feeling a tinge of jealousy that Georgia Tech kids get to party with authentic Neapolitan pizza, while the rest of us are stuck with your bland, run-of-the-mill delivery pizza. 



Many years have gone by, and I still remember this place fondly. Upon my most recent visit, I learned that 1) most of their pizza costs over $20, 2) they have expanded their dining area by opening up the kitchen, and 3) they don't have dry oregano sprigs and peperonata on the table for you to garnish your pizza with anymore. Simultaneously, I was ecstatic to see that Antico is still thriving and that their pizza is still excellent. The quality of the ingredients is superb: the sauce made using the San Marzano tomatoes is pleasantly acidic, the crust is perfectly charred, and the bufala mozzarella is creamy. If this doesn't make you salivate, I don't know what will. 



Although they offer various different pizzas, I only order Margheriat D.O.P. As the famous saying goes, less is more. If you can handle spice, I would recommend Diavola; the addition of soppressata and peperonata packs a punch and flavor. 



In my experience, it is absolutely the best to eat their pizza right out of the oven, piping hot. So I would recommend dining in, rather than doing a take-out. No matter the day, they are extremely busy. However, with the glorious Acunto Napoli brick ovens sitting in their kitchen, they are capable of popping out their pizza really quickly - so the wait won't be bad at all."
,,,,,,,,,"Love the pizza & the atmosphere. 



You get this vibe that makes you feel like you're in a scene waiting for Julia Roberts to appear to hand you your pie. My and my friend use to eat here all the time before she moved & it brings back great memories. My favorite pizza to order is the Diavola. The flavors that hit your mouth as you bite into that meaty pie are unreal and I feel like if you could bite into Italy, that's what it would taste like! 



It can be very busy around lunch and dinner but it's totally worth the wait if there is one. Some of the best pizza in the city. Seriously if you haven't tried it yet you have to soon!"
,,,,,,,,,"Service DOES matter in my food experience and their service is notoriously unfriendly. If you remember the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld, you have the pizza equivalent here. And if you don't like garlic breath, then you're in bad luck. This place is overrated. And good luck with parking. 

It is the first time I share a review that is not a rave. And that's because service is something that cannot be overlooked in the restaurant business."
,,,,,,,,,"This is the best pizza in the city. It's VERY BUSY at night or on the weekends, which makes it hard for the first come first serve seating. I most recently went for lunch on a weekend, which was a much more relaxed environment. 



The calzones are HUGE!!!. Pizza's are also HUGE, but the thin crust makes it not too fulling. I usually can only eat 1-2 slices of pizza from papa johns, but I easily put down 3-4 slices here. If you have more than 2 people eating, it's best to order at least 2 pizzas."
,,,,,,,,,Craft pizzas at its best. Grab a diavolo or margarita and walk across the street to Bar Amalfi for some nice patio seating and bar service!
,,,,,,,,,"This place was suggested to us by locals in Atlanta (and were from Chicago so we have some high standards in pizza). 

We were with a big group so we just went ahead and ordered 4 pizzas- while we were waiting for the pizzas we were able to sit our large party at the seat your self tables. 

The pizza was fresh and amazing- and the condiments are also amazing. 



Defiantly will be revisiting the next time in town!"
,,,,,,,,,"Finding good pizza spots are hard. Finding good pizza spots that dish out your order in under five minutes are nearly impossible. Yet, Antico Pizza delivers. First you order whichever pizza you desire at the counter. Next, pick a seat. Then your pizza literally makes its way to your table. Be sure to grab peppers, cheese, olive oil, and garlic towards where they make the pizza too. 



We ordered the truffle mushroom pizza for $27, which is only being offered for a limited time. It was really delicious. The flavor and aroma of truffle and mushrooms was almost too much to handle! Every bite was so good. You just want to keep eating more. Before you know it, the whole pizza has been devoured! 



Seriously, if you want lightning fast pizza with quality ingredients, this place will surely amaze. My only criticism is that the bottom of the pizza is too flimsy/soggy. I wish it were thicker and stronger. Another thing I would like to note is that the walkway leading towards the cashier often gets too crowded. Having chairs and tables here must some type of fire hazard."
,,,,,,,,,"Terrific pizza, great toppings and atmosphere, great for groups"
,,,,,,,,,"Best authentic Italian pizza in town! There's something about the sauce they use that makes their pizzas extra delicious and special, not to mention they make their pizzas fresh & you can really taste it in the dough (YUM). You order at the counter then seat yourself; it's pretty much always packed but it doesn't take long to find a spot. The best part about this place is that it's BYOB, so grab a bottle of wine/pack of beer & some buddies and head on over!! 



Now onto the food, you really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas but my favorite is the classic margherita. I usually like to add some extra toppings such as pepperoni or sausage, but it's delicious just by itself too! All of their pizzas are pretty simple (not too many crazy toppings), but they are all so savory (again... it's the sauce!) that you really don't need the extra toppings! 



Parking: very limited parking/street parking so I'd recommend ubering, esp if you're planning on BYOB-ing ;) 



Price: Around $20ish for a whole pizza so some may think it's a bit pricey but trust me when I say it's absolutely worth the deliciousness!!!"
,,,,,,,,,"Really fun atmosphere being able to see the chefs cooking your food. Seating is open and makes it fun to sit next to total strangers and strike up a conversation. 



Food is great. Pizza dough tastes fresh and even the pizza crust tastes yummy!! You can help yourself to some free toppings like garlic, cheese, red peppers and some really hot peppers. 



Service is fast and super friendly. 



Parking bough is limited so carpool if you can if you're with a big party!"
,,,,,,,,,"Leeeeeegit pizza, a la Naples. You won't find Sicilian style of thick crusts here, but instead these are similar to NY style aka thin and you fold it in half to eat. 



You go up to the counter, order your pies, get a drink, grab a seat if there isn't a line and then they yell out your number. There are condiments aka garlic, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and hot peppers by the ovens to which you can help yourself. 



Knocked off one star because of two reasons. First, I understand this can't be helped but they don't allow split pizzas-aka one side one style and the other half another style. So if you're a veg eater and your Boo eats meat, you gotta just get two pies. 



Secondly, why are the dang pies so expensive?! This isn't NYC. For a pie, the price is anywhere from $18-20. They sell hundreds of pies a day. So much profit. I wish they were more plebian-friendly. It makes the whole experience centered on hipster-, nouveau riche-, Subaru-driving people only. 



Lastly, a tip: Don't go on a night when there's an Atlanta United game, unless you love hoards of people, waiting for food and hovering for a seat."
15767683,1,,10,10,10,10,10,10,Had the San gennaro and the margherita pizza. The San gennaro was the best pizza I've ever had!
15658373,1,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"I have 5 favorite pizza joints in the entire country--this is one of those spots. 

I always order the margherita. 

Crust, sauce and cheese with basil. Everything was perfect. 

The establishment is half the fun--it's lively, the kitchen is a constant flurry of cooks, busboys and customers. You typically will eat right in the kitchen! The 3 large stone ovens are within sight and you can watch your pizza get made. the kitchen is set up with large benches so you eat in close proximity to other patrons if it is busy. 



It's not a romantic establishment by any means but it can still be a great date night. If you don't want to deal with the crowd (which I actually quite enjoyed) then get it to go. You don't have to order ahead--it is that fast and it'd probably taste better fresher. 



Pizzas are ready in about 5 minutes. I've never seen a more efficient restaurant but with excellent food. I will definitely be back next year during dragon con 2018! 



And for the record my other favorites are (no particular order)

9029574,14,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"This place is amazing. I take all visiting family and friends whenever in town..community seating, authentic flavors, and quick service."
,,,,,,,,,"Antico's consistently delivers quality, delicious, authentic pizza. Two of my favorites are the Diavlo (has a bit of a spicy kick to it) and the Sophia (a white pizza so memorable via the sprinkling of mushrooms and truffle oil). 



Another highlight is the toppings bar - spicy peppers, freshly ground pepper and red pepper, garlic, olive oil, chili oil, and of course, parmesan. There's nothing better than devouring your pizza and then being able to drench your chewy, smoky crust in garlic. Perfection. 



The vibe is quite hectic - but it's a fun vibe. There's always a line but it goes really fast. You have to wait for a table, but again, spots open up quickly. One downside is the parking, which is quite sparse in the lot as well as the street parking. it's worth it, just be prepared to stalk a spot or uber. Which brings me to my next point. 



They of course sell beer and wine, but Antico's is also BYOB, making it a great place for you and a group of friends to crack open bottles on bottles. 



I whole heartedly recommend Antico's. You'd be hard pressed to find a better pizza spot in Atlanta!"
,,,,,,,,,"Definitely one of my favorite pizza restaurants to go to in ATL. Everything here is so fresh and delicious. I've had pizza here several times and it always ALWAYS on point. The dough is soft and chewy and thin just the way I like it. The pizza is always HOT and you can taste the flavours. I love that the pizza is baked in a brick oven. Even better. Communal seating. Price point is for what it's worth. 



If you're looking for deliciouslyOMFGFGgggfddfagfsfaNOMNOMhshshhshshsDEL­IZIOSO tasty pizza or even looking to go into pizza heaven I highly recommend Antico. Everything is delicious. I could eat pizza here everyday. Service is always quick too. They deserve the 5 stars"
,,,,,,,,,Cool atmosphere and great pizza. My coworker took me there for the first time last week and I'll definitely be back to visit again. I actually recently went to an Antico's in Miami and I just really enjoy the quality of the food!
,,,,,,,,,"Delicious. Honestly, this was some of the best pizza I've eve had. We had the San Gennaro pizza and it was perfect, but I think the highlight was the 4 cheese calzone. That calzone was absolutely heavenly. We thought we were over ordering, but the pizza and calzone were completely gone when myself, my husband and our two kids left. We just couldn't imagine leaving any- it was that good. We would definitely return if we make it back to Atlanta. 

Just a heads up, no substitutions - they wouldn't even leave off the onions on half of the pie. You either order the pizza, or you don't."
,,,,,,,,,"I don't even love pizza- and I loved this place. Super casual for such great pizza. A little pricey for pizza, but worth it. Remember- BYOB!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,"What ridiculously amazing pizza! I seriously am not sure I have had pizza this good since I was in Italy. The ratio of toppings to cheese and pizza was great, and I LOVED the texture of the crust. We had the Pomodorini, and it was phenomenal. 



Before you go to Antico, you need to expect a few things so you will have a good time. Mostly, just know that it's not your average pizza place. 



Seating is quite limited. You may have to share a table with people you don't know. Also, you may want to plan to take your pizza to go as backup, but you can bring your pizza to tables nearby outside (such as the café across the street). 



It's pretty loud. It gets super busy, and most of the indoor seating is in a pretty echo-y room. 



If you order to go, listen closely for them to call your order. This goes along with how loud it is in there. A few people didn't hear when their orders were ready. 



Some people may see these traits as negative, but to me, they are just part of a unique and delicious pizza experience. 



My only real negatives were related to service and price. You sort of need an orientation to eat there ""correctly,"" and the cashier seemed a little put out with our questions. Also, it's a little on the sorbet side for pizza, but I won't deny that it's really good product. 



I will definitely be back and can't wait to try more of the pizzas!"
,,,,,,,,,"love this place! love the quick service, and true italian pizza in a family style seating area. 



All the ingredients are imported from Italy and it really does feel like you are in Italy eating the pizza. 



it can get extremely busy so go during off hours if you can or go when they 1st open for dinner. 



If the owners are reading this, I am begging you to bring a gluten free version of the pizza. I recently have gone on a gluten free avoidance diet and it's no fun staring at your kids eating the pizza."
,,,,,,,,,"Hands down, the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Antico is the real deal - an authentic Neapolitan pizzeria that serves up pies so delicious, you'll be spoiled for life. Their thin-crust masterpieces are baked to perfection in an imported Sicilian oven, lathered with a fabulous assortment of sauces, cheeses, peppers, and served piping hot to your table. Their San Gennaro pie is my favorite, with Italian sausage, mozzarella and hot peppers. The more traditional Margherita, a basic serving of sauce, basil and cheese, is also excellent. There's also a modest wine and bottled beer selection to pair with your meal. 



The setting isn't fancy -- most of the long communal tables are in the kitchen, so you can watch these pizza artisans work while you wait for your meal. Ample outdoor seating is also available in a patio across the street, next to their wonderful coffee and dessert shop. Don't forget to make a stop there afterward for some of the best gelato you'll ever taste this side of Italy. 



Next time you're in Atlanta, make a pilgrimage down to the West Side to enjoy some of the best pizza you'll ever have. Antico definitely lives up to the hype."
,,,,,,,,,"I really wanted to enjoy Antico. I love pizza, and couldn't wait to see what the hype was about. My experience started downhill right from the door. 



Whoever the cashier was, she was not polite to any new patron. Antico has rules around their pizza toppings, and it is on the board and on the menu, but when people are looking at the menu, they aren't necessarily reading all the fine print, they are getting straight to their meal! I, unfortunately, was one of those people who had asked one too many questions for this employee who obviously had much more valuable time and other ways to spend it. This experience alone was so bad I docked two stars. She even tried to publicly shame us by shouting at the top of her voice her incredibly condescending answers. Who does that? 



We ordered our pizza, got our wine, and the pizza came out quick. We also easily found a spot to sit which we were lucky because of how crowded it was. 



The pizza was very greasy and the toppings were skimpy. It was just OK. Idk if we got a bad pie, but I kid you not multiple times in biting the pizza I just had a glob of grease come out. Not interested in returning on my own, but if a friends want to, sure."
,,,,,,,,,"Yummy! Best pizza in ATL by far. Been waiting for this for so long and so glad i found this spot. Pizza was ready in 6 minutes!!! Margarita with pepperoni and a peroni beer....heaven!! If you love real Italian clay oven pizza this is the spot for u! You can take ur own wine or buy theirs. Perfect!! And across the street is gio gelato, next door is the Italian restaurant all owned by the same family. Genius!"
,,,,,,,,,"Fastest pizza I've ever had! My friend and I placed an order for the bianca pizza, and within 5 min of sitting down, a freshly baked white pizza topped with different cheeses, basil, and garlic was in front of us. We only managed to finish half the pizza, but that just means leftovers for tomorrow, right? The pizza was delicious and flavorful, and I would definitely recommend it to all in the Atlanta area!"
,,,,,,,,,"Omg their pizza is to die for! The wait is long but so worth it. I love that they have all these other little Italian restaurants on the same block. You feel 

Like you're in a town in Italy. Very cool concept."
,,,,,,,,,"I really wanted to like this pizza based on the rave reviews and even my guest that took me here, hyped up the pizza so much making it seem it was the best thing ever. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. Went in on a Sunday and it wasn't too packed, decided to do the margherita pizza. We waited maybe 5-10 minutes. When it arrived, the pizza looked very authentic. However, it was extremely dry, hardly any sauce. I felt like I was just eating crust and cheese. I think the cooks were having a off day because even my guest found it to be mediocre. Antico's offers up some condiments like garlic, parmesian cheese, olive oil so we took advantage of that to get some flavor in the pizza. Overall, if I came back here, I'd go on a Friday or Sat, perhaps quality would be better."
11826823,4,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Two thousand three hundred and eighty eight people have already reviewed the place and it sits at four stars, what else can be said? 



This place is so friggin cool. You've got to check it out. We had a couple from Chattanooga visit and took them here. Three pies for the six of us and those slices went down easy. One Margherita DOP, one Pomodorini and one Diavola. All excellent. 



It's BYOB and that made it even more awesome I thought. 



I loved that you could get fresh basil, marinara, olive oil, garlic and more all from the counter. What a nice touch!"
,,,,,,,,,Really amazing pizza. I was in Atlanta on business and someone referred me here. Really good pizza and fast and friendly service. Would definitely eat here again.
,,,,,,,,,"After all the hype and having to leave twice because of the wait, my expectations were pretty high. 



Sadly, my experience did not measure up. 



First, the pizza. Ingredients were okay, but not amazing. The cook on both pizzas was very uneven, like they forgot to turn them before one side burned. The other sides came out undercooked. The sauce was thin and poorly distributed. The middle of the pie was soggy upon serving. 



Other considerations: 



The counter service is poorly thought out. 

Do I grab my own drink? What will you bring to the table? Where are the cups? What if I just want water? How is wine served? Why is this so freaking hard? 



The HVAC can't keep up. 

We went in May and the place was burning up inside. Too hot to be comfortable or maintain an appetite. We ended up leaving after we ate our first slices. 



The seating is tortuous. 

Clearly they want you to pay, eat, and leave immediately. No seats with backs. Just hard backless benches and stools that make your butt and back hurt. Not even remotely relaxing. 



The noise never stops. 

I understand that rampant shouting is was passes for ""vibrancy"" in restaurants today, but it's a trend I hate and one that hope will die soon. You can't have a conversation with your meal. It's just too damned loud. 



In the end, though, the pizza was just meh. Not worth returning."
,,,,,,,,,I am in love with this place!!! It has this lovely rustic and authentic feel to it with communal seating. AND it's BYOB. You can't beat a restaurant that lets you bring your fave booze! I went with a group of 5 and we had two pizzas- traditional Margherita pizza and margherita pizza with spicy Italian sausage. They were both to die for! They were cooked fresh to order either a little char on them and we waited for maybe 10 minutes max which is amazing. The restaurant was jam packed so I was really surprised by the fast service. Only downside to this location is that they don't have a soda fountain. Water is $1.80 for a small bottle and sodas are $2.99 for the aluminum bottles so definitely bring your own drinks. Don't forget to cross the street and take home some yummy gelato!
14470092,10,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Excellent Italian pizzas 

Pros: PIZZA duh, fast 

Cons: seatings, self-service (water, seasonings, sides), price 



I visited here probably for ten times, and I can only imagine going here more. 

SERVICE: When I walk in, I am always greeted by the cashiers. They're nice and helpful when choosing what to eat because the menu is in Italian. I often opt for margherita (fresh mozzarella with basil) or meat-with-red-pepper pizzas. Maybe I should memorize pizza names by now. // After you order, you can sit anywhere in the store, and wait until someone calls your order number! They always serve you in a large tin tray. 

FOODS: Mine came out always in less than 15 minutes. While you're waiting, go grab your water near the kitchen, and sides {parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, salt, olive oil, and spicy peppers}. The dough is chewy and perfect. The things ON THE PIZZA tend to be salty, including but not limited to its tomato sauce, sausage, and peppers. The crusts on the bottom may be burnt and your fingers may be turned black and ashy. Portion size wise, if you get full after eating 3 Papa Johns Pizza, you may need to eat half of the pizza. Antico's pizzas are thin, and moist in the center. 



I heard the flour comes from Italy! And the owner owns other restaurants, too. There was a news about Antico's closing due to legal issues with the owner, but it's still up and open! I hope this place never closes. Few suggestions to the restaurant is - expand the place with outdoor seatings and make larger pizzas so people can share with less price. 



Overall, my experiences in Antico's was good."
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza here is great. You just need to be willing to deal with the crappy, European style service. If you can't get over that for awesome pizza, don't come here, but the ambiance and how you watch them make the pizza is a super cool feature as well. Always my go-to pizza place when I'm in the city."
,,,,,,,,,"Delicious pizza and BYOB need I say more? 



Ok, I will. Their pizzas are amazing, but beware, you cannot ask for them to change the pizzas and remove or add toppings really... They are made how they are and that's that. But trust them, they know what they are doing. 



You order your pizza at the register then go inside and pick a table. The tables are long picnic tables and so you may have to get cozy with others. That's ok though, it's good to meet other people. The pizzas come out pretty quick, because they only make a few different types. The pizzas are fresh and delicious, made in pizza ovens. My only complaint is that the pizzas are expensive. My husband and I came here for lunch one day and spent $25 on a pizza, granted we had 2 pieces leftover, but it's too pricey for me to do as often as I would like... which I guess is a good thing for my waistline!"
,,,,,,,,,"Antico is my favorite pizza place in Atlanta and it never disappoints! Whether you get the plain margarita or a meat heavy pizza, the ingredients are so fresh that it just tastes amazing. 



The open concept and seating is also pretty unique. Since the kitchen is basically in the eating area, it gets pretty hot in the room so just be warned! But the air is just filled with amazing pizza smells and aromas. The tables are family style and first come first serve so you never know who will be sitting beside you. Also, the place is BYOB so a lot of people will bring bottles of wine with them. My favorite experience at Antico was when the people sitting next to me offered me the end of their bottle of wine because they were leaving! Always love me some free wine with delicious pizza :) 



I cannot wait to be back in the ATL to get some pizza from Antico!"
,,,,,,,,,"Nearly 2400 reviews and still running at a high rating? Yes, this is the place you want to go for pizza. And of course, it's over by the University and if anyone knows pizza, it's college kids. 



Pizza and calzones, no salad. One cooler of sodas, another cooler of every flavor of San Pellegrino fizzy water. And they have both beer and wine available. We ordered the Diavolo pizza and our number was called a few minutes later, with the pizza brought to our table. 



Antico is community seating in a very loud and very boisterous room in the back. If you're sensitive to noise, perhaps somewhere else would be better for you. On a busy weeknight, it was hopping and the seats at the tables turned over very quickly. One of the staff also came by to pick up dirty trays and empty bottles. 



As for the pizza, wow. Thin crust, Neapolitan style, well topped with delicious toppings. The red peppers and the spicy sopressata made for a very hot pizza. Those peppers had some serious kick. The crust was excellent and the two of us split the one pie with only a slight challenge. 



Antico is excellent. It is not a first date night sort of place, but you can absolutely bring your friend once you get to know them. It's far from quiet and romantic."
,,,,,,,,,"After a long day of exploring Atlanta we wanted to go somewhere where we could order a bunch and share with our entire group, so pizza was decided! 



We came here and I was pretty impressed that the pizza place and across there's gelato and a few small ""Italian"" inspired shops that are all owned by the same person. 



Pricing: the pizzas are NOT cheap first of all. However they are very large and feed a lot of people. For us there was 20 and we ordered 7 pizzas so it wasn't TOO bad. 



Pizza: overall the pizza was pretty good! I wasn't too fond of the burnt tasting crust on just about every slice and a lot of us left the crust uneaten. The toppings were interestingly thrown on. Some slices had a massive bunch of tomatoes or pepperonis and some had like little to none. Lol. 



Service: service was SUPER QUICK. Like wow. Couldn't believe how fast they were. And I'm pretty sure they make to order because you can taste it. And it was a busy evening but across from the pizza shop there is the plaza with other shops and lots of extra seating. And because it's the same owner it works out with being allowed to sit elsewhere. 



However adding on to service, afterwards I wanted to help pick things up and clean up a bit cause you figure it's the courteous thing to do since they've been so busy. They used very large metal trays to hold the pizza and I wanted to carry it back for them. As I was bringing them inside the pizza restaurant a gal who worked there was coming out saw me and started getting mad at me. Saying things like ""why are you doing that?"" Why? Just no."" And I was like ""oh the people who work across said I could bring it over..."" and she was so RUDE. Kept saying I shouldn't have done that and shouldn't be helping out. LOL. What??! Ok. And I'm sorry if I was out of line somehow by helping out? We had massive loads of trash on all of the trays and I just wanted to make it a bit easier for them. I understand how a restaurant works and how things are suppose to go. But apparently not? Anyways. Sad the service wasn't as what I had expected it to be."
,,,,,,,,,"We arrived at about 11:45 on a Saturday to try this place out. They opened at noon. There was already a line when we arrived. They had a little canopy tent to wait under so you were in the shade/protected from any rain...which I thought was pretty considerate. But the cherry on top for me is when at about 11:55, a lady comes out of the building carrying two huge trays of pizza, and walks around offering people slices. Not only are they sheltering me...but feeding me before I even enter the building???? How awesome!!! 



You walk in, order your food at the counter.There are few menu offerings...but I think this is what makes them so efficient as a business.(they specialize in just a few things, and do them incredibly well) I ordered the San Gennaro pizza. When to the back and sat down at one of the picnic stye tables. It was pretty neat because we got to actually watch them make the pizzas. 



The pizza was ready and placed in front of us within almost 5 minutes of when we sat down, which I thought was pretty darn impressive. The portion size was more than enought for two people. It was delicious. Juicy. Flavorful. The crust was just right. 



If you're looking for some high-quality pizza and service, I would hands-down recommend you check out Antico's!"
,,,,,,,,,"Antico is my new favorite pizza spot in Atlanta! I love that it's BYOB while also up-keeping a family friendly atmosphere. My sister and I went on a Saturday night, and although they don't take reservations, we only had to wait in line for about 15-20 mins. The dining area has many large common tables so it was fun to sit next to people we didn't know. We ordered the San Gennaro pizza which was amazing! It was slightly undercooked but I believe that's what they go for. The two of us almost finished an entire pizza! I wish we had ordered a second to have more leftovers!"
,,,,,,,,,"Washelping a friend move and as everyone knows, pizza is the common exchange. Anticco was the place of choice and we went to pick it up. I must have drove past that place a hundred times over the course of the year and I would never think that good. The exterior can fool you. But, as soon as you walk inside, you definitely get a wiff of delicious flavors. 

We got the margarita pizza. Mmm, it was good! The style, amount of sauce seems to stay true to real Italian style pies. If you have had naan before, it feels like you're eating naan. The number of ingredient was lacking but taste fresh. 

The staff was friendly at the counter. Great vibe all in all. To be honest, I feel like it was a bit too expensive for the taste/flavors. It was better than the options I've had around but the word ""overpriced"" really keeps making its way in the forefront of my thoughts."
,,,,,,,,,"I'm from New York, and I can honestly say this pizza was really good and it felt like home! We got the margarita pie, and everything about it was great. One pie is good enough for two people but I definitely could have finished it by myself too! Great place to go to! They also have a caffe across the street (same owner) that sells gelato! It's also very delicious! I think I may stop by for another visit before going home!"
1905098,46,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"So I've lived in Atlanta for almost 7 years, and yet, I'd never experienced Antico. I know, I know.....it's been a long time coming, but finally I got there. My pizza demon got too strong, and I succumb to the pressure, and went for pizza on Sunday afternoon. Besides the fact that the pizza was AWESOME, I hadn't heard anything about Antico. This review is more about what they are missing, versus what you actually get. Yes, the pizza is AH-MAZ-ING...like, INCREDIBLE....probably the best pizza I've had outside of NYC. If you want a great pie, you cannot go wrong with Antico. Period. Now, for what I wasn't prepared for: 



So immediately, the menu seemed way too complex to be a pizza shop. I get it...they want to keep the integrity of the Italian theme and ingredients, and I dig it, but it took me way too long to figure out how to order the pizza I wanted. Even with the help of the staff, it took a while for me to understand. There aren't any substitutions, so what you see is exactly what you get, and you will deal, or you will go elsewhere. At some point, I believe folks will just go elsewhere. You cannot customize your pie in any way....again, WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). I asked about having a pie with half marinara, and half ""white"" sauce, and was told that wasn't possible. That was disappointing. And again, I get designing a menu for an experience, and wanting the patron to have the most authentic experience possible, but I also want the freedom to make my own choices with my pie! LOL LOL. I was also disappointed that there was no fountain drinks....yup, only bottles, and no ice....seriously...you don't have ICE for the drinks? Yes, they are cold, but again, what's the issue with having some convenience. Finally, the price point is pretty high for pizza. I ordered a margherita pizza and added pepperoni ($4 upcharge), with a Coke Zero.....I paid over $29! The pizza easily feeds 3-4 people, depending on how hungry you are, so don't go alone!"
,,,,,,,,,"We ordered the San Gennard, which has sausage, peppers, bufala cheese, and cipolline. The pizza only comes in one size and it was just the right amount of food for 2 hungry people. 



This was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I loved that the crust is so chewy and fluffy and the pizza dough was also chewy. Not too much cheese and the crust was nice and thin. I loved that the dining area is mixed in with the oven area and you can watch them bake the pizzas. I've had pizza in Italy and this pizza tastes just as authentic and delicious. 



The pizza came within 5 minutes after ordering and I also love that there are no plates and you just eat right off the trays. Instead, they the option of using a fork and knife and plenty of paper towels. 



One thing I didn't get to take advantage of is that you can bring your own wine to pair with the pizza at no extra charge! This is definitely something I'd like to try in the future."
,,,,,,,,,"San Gennaro (sausage, pickled red peppers) and Sophia (truffle oil and mushrooms) Pizzas. 



These two pizzas together will MAKE your night.. heck make your week! 



The first time I came here, my husband and I were WAY over zealous with that raw garlic and could still feel that garlicky glory the next day, so now we know to self- control with those toppings. But do try the garlic; it's amazing. Def ask the guys for extra basil too and sprinkle it on everything! 



BYOB and don't come during the rush hours (after 6 pm) unless you want to hover, hover, hover using hawk eye vision, finally snatch a seat, and then be hovered over by other hoverers while you eat . Get's loud and chaotic in here during peak hours. 



We always bring out of town visitors here because... well it's the best! Parking lot sucks and is small, so just turn RIGHT when exiting the parking lot and there is street parking along that side."
,,,,,,,,,"Great pizza, so many choices, we had the sausage and sweet red pepper , it was very good , the only thing I did not like was the sausage was in big chunks and fell off , it would be better to use smaller bits so it would spread the flavor and stay on your slice, we lost some of the sausage because it rolled off on to the table and floor. 

Still a great place , quick and fair priced with great taste."
,,,,,,,,,"Oh My Goodness, where do I even begin!!! Met some good friends here for dinner. At Antico's you can bring your own bottle of wine, no corkage fee. Where can you do this for free? Every other place will charge you at least $10. 



Well let's talk about the venue. Antico's is the ultimate in casual dining. Oh and let me state there are no plates, only plastic knives and forks and paper towels. Believe me I'm rethinking the need for all of the dishware I own?!?!? 



You come in and stand in line to order your pizza. We ordered the Margherita: san marzano tomato, buffalo, basil, garlic - D.O.P., San Gennaro: salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, cipolline and the Verdura: brocolli rabe, mushroom, pomodorini, garlic. 



Each pie was better than the next. All natural ingredients, perfectly cooked. Almost instant service. 



Antico's does not only serve great food. It is an eating experience!!! When in Atlanta make sure you get to Antico's!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,"Definitely overrated. My pizza was very salty, too oily and I had lots of cartilage in my salsiccia. 

I paid $24,50 for it! Insane. Furthermore, they all seem so blasé here. 

A good pizza is not junk food. This was just that."
,,,,,,,,,"Pizza tasted a lot like the pizza I had in Italy. Quick fast service. Trendy place. Nothing fancy. If you order water, grab bottled water out of case. Otherwise cups on table for tap water!"
,,,,,,,,,"Best pizza in town! Had a picky 6 year old with me and he killed his Pizza. Casual atmosphere, the service was a little off. We asked if the pizza could be half plain cheese because both kids wanted something different. Instead of a simple no we got a rude attitude. We will still be back. Food was 5 star service was a 3-4."
,,,,,,,,,A must do in Hotlanta!!! Real deal Italian pie cooked in one of the three wood-fired brick ovens. You know it is legit when the ovens each have names.
,,,,,,,,,"Everything it was cracked up to be 

Authentic 

Tasty. Italian. 

Definitely will return"
,,,,,,,,,"I'm allegedly on a low carb diet, but this is a perfect spot to have a pizza party with your best friend(s), and if you secretly go by yourself, then your bff would be jealous. Antico's pizza is delicious, and its sister restaurant next door, Gio's, is even better. I especially like the peppers in the chili pepper oil, but watch out, it will make the booty burn. Downfalls of this place are the lack of seating and the prices. Why is a pizza $20 plus dollars these days? I feel like a senior citizen reminiscing about the old days, but I remember when eating pizza was a way to get a cheap dinner. Nope, not anymore, unless you get $5.99 Dominos delivery (totally brilliant idea). But, if you want gourmet Neapolitan style pizza with premium Italian beer, you're walking out the door at $60 for two people."
,,,,,,,,,"The whole vibe of Antico is my jam. 



Picture a bunch of farm style wooden tables with multiple seats. 



They don't don't have servers or a bar but byob is fine by me and I love that you can grab a couple plastic cups and sit at a table with friends to wait (not long) for your delicious thin crusted slab of cheesy carb-y goodness. 



We always order the Diablo pizza that has spicy calabrese peppers and spicy meat. It's literally life changing. 

Having the small condiments bar in the 'kitchen' to grab extra toppings is key. 



Raw garlic & extra calabrese peppers? 

Yes please! 



They open stoves from Italy are a great landscape to the true Italian pizza and flavor unmatched by any pizzeria or joint in Atlanta. 



Just returning from Amalfi and Europe and sampling pizza from every location visited I can't help but compare to Antico and siding with my hometown favorite over the county that it originated from. 



There is genuinely no place like home. 

Or like Antico. 

Just go!"
,,,,,,,,,"Not really sure HOW this doesn't have 5 stars... BYOB, fair priced pizza that will knock your socks off. I think the inside environment is really cool. It's fend for yourself but tables turn over quickly. Not great for large groups for that reason... you have to really fight. But for 2-4 people it's not a big deal. Love it. Location isn't like terrific or anything, but it's not that hard to get to. Parking is a pain... I recommend looking for a spot in the neighborhoods. So much easier to get in and out and the walk isn't that bad!"
,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars despite a few drawbacks, mainly because the pizza was delicious. 



When we arrived, there was quite a line and nearly all the community seating was taken. We placed our order and then stood like vultures next to a table until someone left, but surprisingly the turnover was good. Thankfully, we had brought our own bottle of wine which we opened (no corkage fee) and had a little pre-pizza drink from the complimentary plastic cups. 



The pizza that we ordered, the Diavola, had red sauce, hot peppers, and spicy sorpressata. It came out on a large tray and we huddled over it as we devoured it. The dough was downright divine, slightly crusty and blackened around the edges but still soft somehow. Toppings were nice too. Pizza was definitely 5 stars. Will come back again. My wife was even asking what we are doing later this week kind of good. 



The only down sides is that it's a little bit crowded and loud, which probably prevents it from being an optimal experience. The back room is fun because you can see the pizzas being made, but you just end up having to yell at the people you are with. Maybe on a weeknight it might be less crowded and loud, so I'll probably try a day other than Friday next time. Maybe this upcoming Monday...."
,,,,,,,,,"I've traveled around the world eating pizza and this place is still in my top 3 favorite places. After Anticos opened there many imitators tried to copy but I don't think they can quite match the quality of ingredients and consistency of their dough recipe (the chewiness and slightly salty taste). 



What to order: The Diavola Pizza is quite possibly one of the single best quality food item you can order in all of Atlanta. 



The midtown location is also better than the Avalon location due to a more aged oven in my opinion."
,,,,,,,,,"I used to love this place. The food was excellent. However, it seems that quality control has gone down significantly. All of the cheese was on one side of the pizza, and spinach is clumped up on two slices. So, there were two good slices. 

They do an excellent job with the dough with the perfect thin crust, and I love the red sauce (however they seemed to only get one side of my pizza... so there were only two good slices for @$26...)."
,,,,,,,,,"Why has no one told me about this place?! 

Pizza is amazing! It's absolutely delicious and the crust is light and tasty. Toppings are fresh and made with TLC. Would definitely recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,,"Best Pizza in Atlanta hands down! You order, sit and the pizza is out in 5 minutes. There's no plates so you eat right off the pizza tray or on a self made napkin-plate. I normally don't eat the entire crust but the dough Antico uses (double zero?) is soft and chewy so I end up eating everything. Atmosphere is really casual, just pick any spot next to a stranger and dig in! 



The only free beverage option is water directly from the community sink, so I recommend bringing your own or you can always purchase it there."
,,,,,,,,,"Overview 

Grab a slice without the guilt of 'wasting a meal' - not your grandmother's pizza 



Pros 

Best pizza I've ever had - anywhere. And I hate to use superlatives. 

Pizza comes out consistently in less than 10 minute 

Atmosphere: brick oven pizza kitchen meets friendly, shared table cafeteria 

BYOB 

Calabrian chili peppers are bomb 



Cons 

Bad rap with fair wages a few years ago 

Drinks are expensive - so BYOB"
,,,,,,,,,"Classic Roman-style pizza - airy, chewy dough, very thin crust, and simple yet delicious toppings. Wouldn't say the pizzas are particularly mind-blowing but they are very solid, well-made pizzas. The sizes are pretty huge, so this is a good place to come with family or a group of friends. 



I love the decor and layout of the restaurant. Rustic, casual and artsy, the dining place is a large common area with long tables and a semi-open kitchen, where you can see the entire pizza-making process. Service is efficient, with the pizzas being served in less than 10 minutes after the orders are placed. I heard this place is super popular (as evident by the number of reviews) and gets very crowded at times."
,,,,,,,,,"I think this is a 5 star pizzeria, but I have to rate it a 4 based upon my one and only visit. 



First off, this place was cool. Authentic Italian pies made right in front of you from a team of pizza chefs. Fresh dough and ingredients served fast. 



The dining area is made up of large butcher tables in the kitchen, arranged in a group setting. The pizza arrived in a large metal baking pan, which was unique and contributed to the positive classic experience. This just felt like I was participating in pizza history. 



The only reason that I didn't rate this a 5 is because I ordered the wrong pizza for myself. I ordered the Diavolo, which was spicy hot. Normally, I am ok with this, but I just didn't prefer the Tabasco style flavor. 



I will definitely go back again when in ATL, but will just order a different pizza."
,,,,,,,,,Boo Thang took me to Atlanta for my Birthday to see the Solar Eclipse. We had a lot of hardship during this trip but this place wasn't one of them. Luckily We got there just before the total rush and our pizza came out super fast :) and our recommended pizza was hella yummy. we got the San Gennaro we had to eat and go so it was good for us but would not recommend for people who wants private tables. Just get it to go. Pizza is good.
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza is fabulous, great toppings, cooked to serve, and doesn't leave you feeling totally stuffed (unless you eat the whole pizza alone lol) but if you go to the West Midtown location, get it TO GO! The seating is limited and it is SO HOT being crammed in the back by the kitchen sitting at community tables that are typically over filled with both sitting and standing guests. Your best bet is taking it elsewhere to eat. Simply because I don't know many people who enjoy sweating while eating and being crowded in by strangers that are both standing and sitting on top of you. Not to mention you have to yell across the table to make conversation with your date or friend. All in all, great pizza for a decent price but not a great spot for a date night."
,,,,,,,,,"Antico has the most unbelievable and amazing pizza in the south! If you are a pizza snob, then look no further, Antico is crazy good. The restaurant itself is crazy.... well just plain crazy. As one of our family members described Antico, this is not just dinner, this is an experience. I honestly do not think they meant it to be a real compliment but if you know what you are in for and you are prepared Antico can be a real good time. If you are not into crazy, then just order your pizza to go. You walk in and place your order from a line, then you find a spot at a community table and wait for your number to be called for them to bring your pizza to you. The place is loud, real loud and super busy on a Saturday evening, but well worth the chaos. I wish I would have known you could bring your own bottles of wine or beers because so many people had bottles and were sharing in the little plastic cups stacked up at every table. The only drinks you could order included bottled coke products, a pretty good selection of wines, and Peroni was the only beer. So we went with a coke zero and 5 Peronis for our group. We sat in the back room so we could watch the pizzas being made and we were entertained and impressed. They have it down to a science. The dough is spun and pressed out by experts, then stacked with cheese, a little sauce swirl, then the toppings before being slid onto a waiting pizza paddle then into the wood fired ovens and viola, a few quick minutes later you have your pizza. We ordered the margarita plus artichokes, and the San Gerraro. Both were amazing and as we watched them make the pizzas we decided a calzone and Diavola was definitely on the order list for next time. We almost ordered more because our family could not believe how good it was although the two pizzas completely stuffed the five of us. Our dad, who prefers fine dining or at least a place that provides plates and silverware, was a little horrified that the pizza is brought out on sheet pans, placed on your community table, then you tear off paper towels to use as a plate or just eat right from the sheet tray with your hands. However, one bite of this amazing pizza and the ""ambiance"", or lack thereof,was all forgiven. I wish I was closer to Antico to go more often, but probably a good thing I am not because I would go all the time. Cannot wait to go again."
,,,,,,,,,"True Italian pizza in the heart of Atlanta. Though it is expensive, it's worth the experience if you've never been. Be prepared for a line and a wait for a seat if you're dining in. The staff is very no frills and can be a little rude but I think it's just due to the amount of people they are dealing with. I prefer to get it to go so I don't have to deal with that! Parking can be a challenge on busy nights but they do offer valet."
,,,,,,,,,"Okay, so I am pizza obsessed and although I love to cook, we eat pizza at least once a week. (doesn't everyone just get those crazy cravings? no? oh. ) 



I had a hard time rating this place please because everytime I go it has been different. The first 2 times I was very unimpressed... the crust took about 40% of the pizza and one slice was almost entirely a crust bubble! Their pizza is delicious and their crust is a perfect mix of chewy and crispy but I did not pay the money for bread. So the 3rd time I came prepared and asked them at the front to make sure there isn't such a huge crust. He suggested I ask for extra sauce and cheese to make that happen so I did... well the crust was again too large and then the pizza was soggy. 



It seems like all I am doing is ranting so why the 4 stars? BECAUSE ITS FREAKIN GOOD! The 60% pizza I got, in all its glory with toppings and sauce, was so good I could easily finish a whole pizza by myself. I will continue to come here and beg that I don't get such a crustful pizza, and one day, my prayers might be answered and I think I will have found the perfect pizza. 



I am a fan of the ambiance, being a lover of all things food and cooking I don't mind being in the kitchen. As for communal eating, it's always fun for me, I love talking to strangers! There was that one time that I had a few words with the 7 months pregnant lady sitting next to me, downing a whole bottle of red wine... but we won't count that! 



Watch out for the line to order when it is cold outside! You might get stuck standing outside but the smell of their delicious pizza will keep you content. This is not my favorite in the A but they are soooo close."
,,,,,,,,,"I was told by my niece tha this is the best pizza in Atlanta, better than what you can get in Italy even! I have not been to Italy, so i cannot corroborate that statement. Regardless, it was really good. Had the Diavlo pizza, which was a combo of spicy soppreseta, buffalo mozzarella and something else tasty (pepperonata). 



The pizza was great, although my favorite is still Urban Crust in downtown Plano Texas (Yee Haw). After having several awesome IPAs at Ormsby's, coming here and having to drink a Peroni was a let down, but I slugged through it and I took one for the team. The pizza made up for it. It was awesome. 



The place itself is cool, with communal seating, and from the taste of the pizza, I can understand why it is so popular."
,,,,,,,,,"When getting ready to travel to Atlanta earlier this year I began researching the best places to eat. One item we wanted to find in particular was the best pizza in Atlanta. Several websites pointed me in Antico's direction and I'm so glad I listened - not only do I believe this to be the best pizza in Atlanta, I'm willing to bet this is the best pizza you will find anywhere. 



First of all Antico's can be found on a corner in right in the middle of ""Westside Little Italia."" It's adorable! There's 5 places all affiliated with Antico on Hemphill Ave. 



Once inside, the atmosphere is pretty amazing, it's small, a little warm but you sit aside the crew making your pizza in authentic pizza ovens straight from Naples in Italy. Smells of basil and garlic swirling through the air. I found out later that Antico is BYOB which would have been awesome to know prior to visiting so I wanted to make sure and share that here!! 



The many reviews and sites I scoured pointed us to two pizzas in particular, the San Gennaro and the Lasagna. Both were out of this world!! The crust is perfectly crispy with just the right amount of char but also soft and chewy. Toppings were flavorful and plentiful, while cheese was fresh made and delicioso!! 



Antico's is a bit on the pricey side but it's worth it because it's damn delicious and after your pizza you can head over to the Gelateria for some dessert!!"
,,,,,,,,,"this place was recommended to me by one of my friends and yummmmmmmmm! Small menu, very simple ingredients, fresh, HUGE, but delicious! One whole pizza and can feed about 2-3 people and the slices are...yeah, huge. price range, around $19-22 



We went in when it was not busy and our pizza came out pretty fast! they actually bring the pizza to you by calling out your call number so make sure you hold on to your receipt and pa close attention to your order number! 



My friends and I ordered 2 different pizzas: the Diavola (spicy sopressata, pepperonata, bufala) and MARGHERITA D.O.P (san marzano tomato, bufala, basil, garlic) its hard to choose between those two which one tasted better, but in my opinion, both were the winners!"
,,,,,,,,,"I just got dinner here to celebrate my roommate's birthday. The pizza was delicious albeit a little more pricey than the average pizza. 

The atmosphere is very laid back and the big tables are great for groups. 

Pro tip: The BYOB is great but bring your own cork screw!!"
,,,,,,,,,"You will love this place as long as you don't want Pepperoni and Mushrooms on the same pizza.....because you can't have it. I'm serious you can't. They won't sell it to you and they won't make it. No you can't buy the mushrooms on the side, no you can't pay extra. They refuse to do it!! I personally don't get it and they won't get my money ever again!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,"I don't know if I can quite give Antico's my highest recommendation but I will say the pizza is great. My wife and I visited recently and ordered the San Gennaro, which came recommended by the cashier (side note: I see quite a few people have mentioned the service was bad, I thought it was perfectly acceptable). We sat at a large table with several other guests and chatted with everyone until our pie arrived (about 10 minutes). The crust really sells the pizza; it's chewy with a slightly charred outside and excellent flavor. The sweet peppers complimented the salty sausage well. Cheese was on point. 



I also really liked the condiment bar. Located near the kitchen is a small counter top set up with cheese, pepper, and minced garlic. I used a little of all three on every slice and it was magical. 



One of my gripes has to do with drinks, but it's a minor one. The drinks were expensive so we went with water. We could not locate any ice and had to walk back near the bathrooms and pour ourselves tap water into these tiny disposable cups. In other words, I had to make a trip every five seconds to grab room temperature tap water. Not really a huge fan of that. Since everyone sits together at giant tables, carafes or pitchers that could be shared would really help out! Bonus points for being BYOB, though, and I will take advantage of that next time. 



My bigger gripe has to do with the fact that, despite it being delicious, the pizza gave me the worst stomach cramps in recent memory and quite a bit of digestive distress. I'll give Antico's another shot but I'm hoping to not have a redo."
,,,,,,,,,This place is so awesome I really like their pizza. I enjoyed their pizza so much that I would come back every time I come back to Atlanta.
,,,,,,,,,Delicious wood fired pizza! Casual and fun atmosphere. Stopped here as I traveled through the area. They have a great drink selection but it's also open to BYOB which is cool! I was here on a Sunday afternoon and ran into a lot of Atlanta Falcons fans and a few players. If it's good enough for professional football players then I'm game for that!
,,,,,,,,,"This place is definitely an experience. They are located in Little Italy and are serving up authentic Italian style pizza. Although I liked the taste of the pizza and the communal style eating was cool. It is definitely not the best pizza I've tasted in Atlanta, but it rates in the top 5. I was not a fan of the lack of pizza variations. I guess I've been spoiled by chain pizza establishments where I can get multiple topping choices on my pizza and so I was not thrilled about paying $26 for a pizza that I could only have one meat, either pepperoni or sausage, on it. Also, it is one size fits all. You can not choose small or medium, only large. The seating is quite limited which makes the communal style, catch as catch can seating and eating a bit cumbersome, especially if you come with a group. The pizza comes to your table via a large silver pan. There are NO plates and the cups and cutlery are plastic. Also, when I asked for some water I was directed to the sink that was off to the side of the room. Now, on a great note, it is BYOB! That is a major plus!! So, you will see people bringing in bottles of wine among other things. Lastly, I loved that the kitchen was open so we got to see the chefs tossing the dough and preparing each pizza by hand. I've been told that they close once all of the dough has been used up for the day, so don't wait to late to come and dine!!"
,,,,,,,,,"Very real Italian style pizza. Bit pricey. Cashier girls are not nice, they think all customers supposed to know their menus before come. 

I like the style that feel like eating in their kitchen, also listening loud Italian music. 

BYOB, no plates(use brown roll paper), get ""to go box"" by yourself from box stack. You will have different experiences, but their pizza is real McCoy."
,,,,,,,,,"OVERRATED. I apologize in advance to whoever's favorite pizza place this is but Antico is nothing special. 



I had seen so much hype about Antico on Yelp that I thought I'd give it try. They do not have single slices so you have to order a whole pizza (they only offer one size). I ordered the most popular pizza, San Gennaro ($22) to-go. I called ahead to place my order and gave the women my name. When I went in to pick it up the woman at the register said that they don't take name they give you a number and even then they don't start cooking your pizza until you come in and pay for it. So basically don't think you're going to save any time by calling ahead. 



The restaurant had a pretty cool layout. It was community-style seating right next to the ovens so you can see the chefs making your pizza. It's also a BYOB spot. 



However, when I got home I was surprised by how basic and un-exciting my pizza tasted. Initially I didn't like it at all because I wasn't expecting it to be so sweet and there were no more than 5 pieces of sausage on the entire pizza. But I stuck my pizza in the oven for about 10 mins to get it crispy and it tasted a little better. The pizzas in the restaurant looked like they we're cooked crispy however the to-go pizza was as well-done as Domino's. 



Overall, very regular pizza. Nothing exciting. I'll stick to Fellini's."
,,,,,,,,,"Antico is seriously as good as it gets. The line was super quick although the place was packed (dont let a busy crowd scare you away), my friend and I asked a couple questions about the pizza, then asked for a crowd favorite, ordered it, grabbed some beers and quickly found a couple empty seats around the big table. I love family style eating and talking to perfectly good strangers while eating amazing food, so this was just up my alley! 



Pizza came piping hot less than 15 minutes later, and first bite- HELLO LADY. Changed my life, the cheese, sausage, and light sauce, thin crust, i'm drooling.. 



Eat here for your next meal, and tell me thank you!! 



Salute!"
,,,,,,,,,"I heard about this price and the story behind is owner, so once in Atlanta I try it. 

Pizza is really good. It looks like you are wrong in your grandmother house !"
,,,,,,,,,Best pizza around but be prepared to wait. Communal seating can be stressful- highly recommend going during off hours. Diavola pizza is worth it though!
,,,,,,,,,I absolutely love this place. The pizza is always good here. Service is great. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The place is always clean. Yes to Antico Pizza!
,,,,,,,,,"Fresh flavors, BYOB, fun open atmosphere. 



Be prepared to wait in line to order your crispy thin crust masterpiece -- maybe drink your wine while you wait! Initially, I was concerned that because of the thin crust, we would need two of those bad boys to fill us up; we were advised otherwise and we shared a single pizza -- which was enough to fill our tummies. Little surprised on the cost-to-size of the pizza. 



Even for take-out, while you wait on your pie, walk around to the open kitchen area to stock up on cups of add-ons (grated parm, peppers, pepper flakes, etc.) to enhance the already yummy flavors. 



This may not be the *best* place to 'sit and hang out' after you finish the food, because chances are, someone else will be looking for a place to eat their food."
,,,,,,,,,"There's not a lot to add to ~2500 reviews of this pizzeria, but heck, I'll put in my two Euros. It's just scrumptious pizzas and tap water from a sink/BYOB at Antico. Order at the counter, tip with cash, sit down next to strangers, and keep your ears open for your number. 



I've noshed on these three pizzas, in order of most favored to somewhat less favored: 

San Gennaro (salsiccia/sausage, dolce piccante pepper/peppadews?, bufala/mozzarella, cipolline/onions) $22--My favorite so far, but I've been eyeing the lasagna for next time. Excellent sauce, yummy sausage. Liked the peppers. The crust is superb. 



Napoletana (broccoli rabe, salsiccia, bufala) $21--This pizza doesn't come with tomato sauce. I missed the sauce, but I really liked the huge hunks of sausage and felt semi-healthy for eating vegetables. Recommended. 



Diavola (spicy sopressata, pepperonata, bufala), $22--Spice lovers, this is your pie. A little too hot for me, but those with more tolerant tongues will be pleased. 



Pizzas are slightly salty. Antico chars the crust a bit so you will end up with sooty smudges on your fingers, if you're not a knife and forker. The pizzas are thin and have about eight slices to a pie. A person could eat roughly half of a pie; the pizzas come in just one size. 



Don't show up too late since the dough sometimes runs out. The women taking your orders and bringing you your pies are detached but not rude or anything. There is a wee parking lot right in front of the entrance, and there's a bigger one that wraps around the building, with the entrance on Ethel Street. If you leave guns and take cannoli, head across the street to Caffe Antico for their freshly-filled, custom-made ones."
,,,,,,,,,"This was probably one of the most stressful pizza-eating experiences I've ever had. 



And I'd do it again. 



Because it's GOOD. Thin, slightly charred pizza that comes out within a few minutes? Check. Toppings? Check! BYOB? CHECK! 



My boyfriend's family and I went on what I can only assume is Atlanta's official Pizza Time, because Antico was packed. We didn't wait in line too long and ordered two pizzas. We headed to the main dining area (with the open kitchen) and stood by the walk-in freezer for a few minutes, as every table was full. (If you are sitting at a table, it seems that the general rule is to avoid eye contact with standing folks waiting to be seated.) Our pizzas came out; panic set in - we were still standing. 



A member of the kitchen staff led us to the back ""table,"" which isn't really a nice table. It's steel and there are no chairs/stools. But there are paper towels and utensils, so we didn't complain! The pizzas were outstanding and the toppings my boyfriend's dad got were red pepper flakes and raw, minced garlic - excellent options! My favorite was the margherita with pepperoni. I'm a self-proclaimed pizza snob and I already can't wait to get back to Antico!"
,,,,,,,,,"This is my first experience coming here and I have to say it's not bad nor it is amazing. I was really hyped up on coming here but after trying it out I'm not going to drive out of my way to eat here. 



The thin pizza came out the oven and they put the cooking sheet with the pizza on a cold metal pan. Whatever hot crispness of the pizza was gone after 5 minutes sitting on the pan. 



For a $20 San Gennaro pizza, I was greeted with maybe 10 pieces of sausage. The sausage was very high quality but I thought they skimped out on the. The overall flavor of the pizza was great. The dough was actually cooked well without any traces of raw dough. 



Water was free but it literally came out of the sink faucet. 



There is only 1 bathroom so if you need to go on a busy day, be prepared to wait 5-10min. 



The front cashiers were very friendly and helpful. They were able to answer all the questions I had without a problem."
,,,,,,,,,"The cashiers must be related to the owner and they can't get rid of them. 



Antico cashier training lesson one: never smile. 

Lesson two: glare at the people about to hand you money. 

Lesson three: look miserable. 



Sure, the pizza is good. But if you live in Atlanta you probably have a good pizza place close to your house. Is it worth the drive to this part of town and struggle to find a parking place? Not when you're going to be met at the cash register with attitude. 



It's been this way for a while, that's why I assume the cashiers are relatives or have naked pictures of the owner or something. Can't imagine why anyone would hire them. 



We go here about once every six months when errands put us in that part of town. Otherwise, I can find plenty of good places that seem happy to receive my business."
14984780,3,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Thin crust, pizza. Don't like thin crust, this is not your place. Pizzas cost roughly $20-26, depending on toppings, each feed about 2 people. the pizzas come out fast and hot. This place doesn't joke around. We came here on a Monday, around 4pm and there was no wait. Early bird gets the warm! We ordered in 5 mins, and got our food within 7 mins. 



*Bring your own water, unless you want to drink from tap* 



The food here is amazing, it has the right amount of toppings/crust ratio, It doesn't have the feeling of feeling bloated after eating the crust. The toppings aren't stacked like other pizzas, but enough to get the full taste of the pizza. I'm visiting from Seattle, and I wish we had this back at home. I'll miss this place."
,,,,,,,,,"Cool and unique place. You order pizza at the counter (only available in full/large pies). Then u sit at large (community/shared) picnic tables and they bring your pizza. The food was above average taste. 



Parking and seating are fair, and may be tough to find in ultra busy times."
,,,,,,,,,"Best pizza in town. Period. 



I can't say enough good things about this place. Great food. Fast service. Bring your own beer or wine. The new guy in the front scratched his head for a good minute I mean really dug his nails into his scalp then offered to cut my pizza. I said no thank you. Also, the cashiers in the front could take a class or two on customer service but other than that the place is a must visit. 



Get the San Gennaro and the Sophia. My wife and I get a pie each and save the leftovers for breakfast. Nothing beats cold pizza."
5131362,13,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This place has great Neapolitan pizza in Atlanta. I am from NY and I will really only eat pizza here and at O4W pizza (and I guess Fellini's in moments of true desperation...). The San Genaro and Diavola pies are both delicious. I also love the condiments station that has wonderful imported olive oil, spicey pepper oil and fresh basil. You order up front and then you eat in the back on long communal tables that are basically in an extension of the kitchen. The pizza's come out on huge baking sheets and REMEMBER that it is BYOB. The atmosphere can feel a little loud and chaotic but in this case it really adds to the fun of the experience."
,,,,,,,,,"One of the premier pizza places in all of Atlanta! Love the way they prepare the dough, reminiscent of NYC italian pizza houses. Very flavor full and packed with fresh ingredients and toppings. The only reason it didn't pull a 5 star is the hefty price tag. That does not reflect how truly delicious the food is though. Very asthetically pleasing and nestled in the GA Tech corridor, this is a place to impress guests and leave a lasting impression. I will admit that the staff had a bit of an attitude, but that just adds to the ""new york"" feel (I guess). Once you get past that, the food is heavenly! Great calzone, but when we asked to add sausage, we were told no... (huh?) Still a 4 star delight nonetheless. We will be back...oh, and pro tip- bring your own paper plates."
,,,,,,,,,"Had four separate pizzas there today. Each was cold when we finally got them (surprising since we ate in). All had the required toppings - just not very much or in any type of even distribution. It looked as though a four-year old had randomly thrown the peppers on one part, sausage in another, etc. we had to pick them off so each in our party could have a sampling in their slice. Finally, the dough was not only soggy, it was extremely tough (not chewy). 



It may be trendy to many, but it certainly didn't impress me."
,,,,,,,,,"Consistently one of the best pizza places in Atlanta. Any time I'm in the area I will stop by. 



I recommend the San Gennaro. 



And the best part is that it has led to the elevation of the pizza game in Atlanta. We have more great pizza in Atlanta than ever before."
,,,,,,,,,"So...I ate an entire pie by myself. Thin crust, mind you, but 8 slices and 16 inches in diameter. And I'd do it again!!! 



Orders come out fast. I received my pizza less than 10 minutes after I ordered. The ladies in the front may not know how to smile, but they will let you know their opinion of the menu. Between the San Gennaro (Sausage) and the Diavalo (Salami), I was told to pick the former, and I was not disappointed. 



I accidentally parked in the lot across from Gio's, which does say Antico on it, but I believe it's actually their storage facility. My car was not booted, so I assume it's okay to park there for any of the sister restaurants. 



Afterwards, we walked across the street to Antico Caffe for some heavenly gelato. Skip Antico Pizza's stuffy dining room and bring your pie to the other side if the weather permits. They've got a gorgeous patio setting!"
,,,,,,,,,"It's a unique and welcome piece of the Atlanta culinary scene. Nestled in the heart of west midtown, Antico offers an intimate experience in Neopolitan dining. The pizzas are perfection and range from $20-27 for a pie that easily feeds two. All the pies sounded great but the Sophia and its white truffle oil were too irresistible so I ended up getting that. The food is great on it's own, but what really stands out is the atmosphere. The main dining area consists of about four communal dining tables and a couple of bar tables in front of the kitchen and ovens. It's also byob so you can bring your favorite six pack or bottle of wine to accompany the meal. The pizzas come out really fast, within ten minutes of ordering and the servers are really good about clearing tables to get other people seated as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the short wait time for food leaves you with less time to find a seat at this often packed, seat-yourself establishment. On the bright side, there's plenty of street parking on Hemphill and a decently sized parking lot, so parking isn't a huge issue. However, if you hate being surrounded by other people, you might want to stay away during the dinner rush. Alternatively, you can get your pie to go, head east down 14th and make a mid-afternoon picnic of it at Piedmont Park. Either way, you're likely to enjoy your food and whatever company you bring here. 



Taste: 5/5 

Value: 4/5 

Service: 3/5 

Atmosphere: 5/5"
,,,,,,,,,"I love the pizza! My favorite is the margherita pizza. It's just sooooo good! The restaurant has a nice atmosphere too. 



I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars for two reasons. First, I think it's way over priced. One pizza is around $22. Also, it's hard to find a place to sit here. It's a smaller building and it's usually pretty busy. I recommend coming here in a small group, or just getting your pizza to go. 



Despite what I said in the paragraph above, this is still one of my all time favorite pizza restaurants. Definitely the best pizza in Atlanta."
,,,,,,,,,"Really good pizza, the line moves quickly, and love their wine standard. The cannolis didn't impress me."
,,,,,,,,,"Parking: We parked for free in a lot nearby. (at least i think it was free LOL) 



Service: It's a casual place where you order at a register, than seat yourself wherever you find space. There are large tables that everyone shares together to sit and eat. 



Food: Best pizza in Atlanta. For real. I tried the San Genaro pizza I think it's called, and loved it. I split it with 2 other friends and it filled the 3 of us up nicely. 



overall experience: A+"
,,,,,,,,,"This just might be my favorite pizza in Atlanta! 



The menu is simple and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. The open concept and seating makes you feel like you're eating in another country. This is a perfect place for a group of people or a date night."
,,,,,,,,,"By far the best pizza in the South! We go here regularly and are never disappointed. While the ordering and finding a table process can be a little stressful for a newcomer, it's totally worth it for the DIVINE pizza experience. The fact that you can bring your own bottle of wine in definitely eases the process as well. The front staff could definitely be a little friendlier, but I understand that they're trying to move people in and out pretty quickly. I would NOT recommend eating there during the summer though, as the back dining room can get VERY hot, but it's great to pick and up and go or to even take across the street and eat while you order gelato. 



The best pizza this side of Italy, by far!"
,,,,,,,,,"Ate here recently with a large group. Pizza was ""OK"" (and I will admit I do not eat a lot of pizza) but did not, for me anyway, live up to expectations. We had three different pizzas for a good selection. The picnic table style family seating was an issue as we could not find space to sit together and ended up at different tables. The pizza is pricey (over priced in my opinion) and for me anyway it is hard to eat and enjoy a meal with people staring at me because the want my seat. Glad I tried it..... but not likely to go back. That said, I have a hard time understanding how it ranks so highly among Atlanta's restaurants. Would not discourage anyone from trying it though - it may be more your ""cup of tea"" than mine."
,,,,,,,,,"What can I say that 2000 people didnt already say? Not much but I can share a similar experience I had that the other 2000+ people did as well. 



This is a total neighborhood pizza joint, I went on a Saturday night for dinner and it was packed! The line was literally almost coming out the door and might I remind you that this place can seat a good 50-80 people. As soon as I walked in I saw everyone holding their own beers and wine as they do not serve alcohol here so I actually left the line with my buddy and went to the gas station around the block and grabbed a 6pack of that Perroni Italian Beer to match with this authentic Italian pizza. 



So let me start by saying the line moves fairly quickly because of the fact that they use some legit ovens imported from Italy that cook these thin pies in about a min or so. I ordered the San Gennaro based on alot of reviews and it did not disappoint. While waiting for my pizza and fighting to look for a table to sit at I saw they had a little condiment section which is self serve. They had fresh garlic / olive oil / spicy chili garlic sauce / and of course parmesan cheese. They somehow find you in the midst of a 100 people and scream out your order number as its pretty loud in there. I believe Georgia Tech is right near by so there was alot of young people there and it was very lively. 



Honestly this is the type of joint you can go to on the weekends as a casual hang out or even on a date. The people that were sitting in front of me, a party of 6 were from New York and we were talking about all the great pies we've had as I travel to alot of different states and look for the best pizzeria every place I visit. They couldnt stop telling me how good the pizza is and how it was even better than the stuff in New York. This place is by far the best authentic italian pizza ive ever had and we didnt leave a single slice on this huge pie. Thank you Antico, your pizza was the most memorable meal of my 3 day trip."
11566029,2,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Awesome. Nuff said! Coming from a native New Yorker, I absolutely love the pizza here. Fresh ingredients and super fast on the service make this a must stop for all of our out of town guests. Love the aluminum Coca-Cola bottles which go great with our delicious pizza."
,,,,,,,,,I've been hearing about this place for a long time and the previous times we managed to make it on a day it was closed so FINALLY we came to find out what all the hype was about. It was suggested that we try the San Gennaro and Lasagna pizzas. The SG uses sausage from Chicago and has some great peppers to add a little kick and a lot of flavor. Super great pizza. The other pizza has a weird name because I had a different idea of what it might be versus what it was. I am a sucker for ricotta so that got me but another great pizza. I was going back and forth and I'm not sure there is a winner but I can tell you there definitely are no losers. The ambiance is super quaint - Italian music playing while the cooks make the pizzas. And the pizzas come out within minutes and it's BYOB. Can't beat this spot!
9029464,2,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Heard many great things about this local pizza spot at Georgia Tech. It was buzzing. (haha GT joke I guess). But anywho! Pizza was rather expensive for average taste. I paid $23 for the San Gennaro which had sausage, red peppers, onions and mozzarella cheese. Our fresh pizza took no longer than 6 minutes to come out which was great! Service was quick and delightful. 



My friend and I were able to see the chefs do all their prep and cooking right in front of us and I absolutely love that concept anywhere! 



For $23 I couldn't believe they give you cups just so that you can go to the sink and fill up your complimentary water. I know I'll get tap regardless, but I don't think I should have to walk up to a sink and fill my own cup. 



Parking was large! Small parking in the front, but tons of parking towards the back of the restaurant. So it shouldn't be difficult to secure a spot. 



I probably would come back, but it will be quite some time. Price just isn't worth their food, in my opinion!"
,,,,,,,,,"Lost my draft, but will try to keep this short and to the point. Even though you might be reading this while waiting in line. 



Location - The layout is weird with just one ""main"" dining table like they only expected people to do take out when they first opened. Throughout the years, they've added more tables and chairs to the kitchen area. One thing if it's cold outside, the kitchen is the warmest spot in the place. Now, if you're here and it's summer - get plenty of water and wear short sleeve clothes. It's going to be a slight sauna. 



Service - Order at the counter, food is brought to you if you can find a seat. Don't be a snob please and share your table if you have room for anyone asking. 



All the times I've been here and brought someone who has visited prior, the San Gennaro is the pizza that everyone loves. I don't think I've tried any other topping combination besides the basic margarita. 



Yes, drinks are a little over priced. I usually get the blood orange san pellegrino. Slightly sweet but still mellow. The coke bottles are small and not really worth it. 



I've also had the chocolate cannolis, but I think saving room for gelato is more worth it. 



If food alone, it would be a 5. But I'm glad the Avalon location fixed the seating issue that is problematic at this original location."
14428305,16,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Antico's is by far my favorite pizza restaurant in Atlanta. 



At Antico's, you are family. The ambience is loud and tightly packed with people laughing & conversing at each table. The restaurant allows their patrons to bring in their own alcohol when dining there which is always fun/saves money. 



When it comes to what to order, the San Gerrano is by far my favorite pizza with the Diavalo being a close second. After ordering, you can sit down and wait for the friendly staff to freshly make & bake your pizzas. 



Just trust me and go to Antico's, you won't regret it!"
,,,,,,,,,"I think after hearing so much about this spot I had higher expectations, it was tasty but nothing amazing to me. I really loved that you can bring your own bottle of wine which makes it a lot of fun and great to catch up with friends which could be what brings me back"
,,,,,,,,,"Antico Pizza Napoletana is still consistently delivering the best Pizza in Atlanta! My all-time favorite is the Bianca. Antico pizza dough made with triple zero flour imported from Italy - is the best i've ever had - and I've had my fair share of pizza around the globe! 



Top that with the finest ingredients imported from Italy - fresh salty Ricotta, Pulled Fior di Latte and Bufala mozzarella cheeses, fresh Pecorino Romano cheese, Torn Basil - all topped with fine extra virgin olive oil! 



I think my favorite part of Antico might be the accouterments. The Parmigiano-Reggian, Calibrian chile, and Olive Oil are my favorites! And if you've never tried Calibrian chile, you're long overdue. I recommend you stop what you are doing and head to Antico now!"
,,,,,,,,,"Casual birthday dinner here on the weekend and this place was hopping. The weather was beautiful, so everyone was out for pizza. We got the meatball pizza and zomg it was amazing. We opted to sit outside across the street, because it was super loud and crowded inside. Food was great."
,,,,,,,,,"My hands down favorite pizza in Atlanta is Ammazza but since their unfortunate closing, I've been itching for the next best thing: Antico. I thought my pizza was slightly soggy in the middle but overall a good pie."
,,,,,,,,,"Horrible, horrible experience. If I could give zero stars I would. 



Came here with a group of 10, several of us are in the industry. 



As half of us are still eating,The most miserable employee I've ever met (older white haired guy) walked up to our table ten minutes after we received our pizzas and said we needed to leave our table because people were waiting. One of our friends said to him half of us were still eating and he suggested that half of us needed to leave and the other half could stay until we finished eating. He proceeded to be extremely rude and just stand there as if he wanted us to immediately get up and leave. 



I have been here before but after this experience I will never go back. This was literally the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and I or any of the other ppl at the table will not be back and will definitely not be recommending this place to anyone as long as they employ people with this guys attitude. 



For anyone trying to go to dinner without being pushed out of the door before you even finish your meal do not go here. 



And for the people who actually own this establishment, you should really be aware of employees who will eventually run your business into the ground."
,,,,,,,,,"Noticed the great reviews on this place and decided to check it out while in town. 



This place serves gourmet pizza and it definitely didn't let down. A lot of people who traveled to ATL also recommended this place. 



Margherita w/ pepperoni $23 - 4/5 - I enjoyed the flavors of this, but it didn't particularly blow my mind. The crust was a little too soft for my liking. 

Lasagna $20 - 4/5 - I don't remember it too much, but I enjoyed it. 

I tried some of their peppers they offered on the side and didn't really enjoy it. 



I'd recommend this place if you love gourmet pizzas but other than that i'd prefer a sicilian pizza from the east coast."
,,,,,,,,,Probably my favorite pizza in Atlanta. The real wood fire ovens they use give a great flavor and it is always fun to see them making the pizza. My favorite is either the margarita pizza or the Diavola pizza. This place can be somewhat pricey but it's worth it in my opinion as you are getting a great product.
,,,,,,,,,"Freaking awesome. Even if you choose the wrong pizza, it'll still be good, great service, eat for cheap. Amazing joint!!!"
,,,,,,,,,"Absolutely the best pizza ever!!! So good that we ordered an extra one to go since I don't live in the area!! It's better than the pizzas I had in Verona and Rome, Italy! Will definitely plan to return when in the area again!"
,,,,,,,,,"I guess it is true... I don't think I have had any other pizza that is better than this. 

The only draw back is.. i can only have one as it's pretty big. But pricy but worth it. 

Highly recommended..."
,,,,,,,,,"I love this place. The pizza is perfect. The cafeteria style setup is great on a not-so-busy day. I love feeling like I'm eating in the kitchen. The reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the prices and front of the house service. At that price point, I can't just drop in anytime. The two girls at the front are strange..."
,,,,,,,,,"Hands down to the best Pizza ever. Even my friend from New York said he liked it better than what he has had in NY. I got the Capricciosa and it was a perfect size for two hungry people. They only have one sized pizza. It was great, had right amount of cheese, thin crust and brick oven made. I totally recommend getting it if you love artichokes. 

This place accepts the BYOB and I highly recommend getting your own booze because all the drinks including non-alcoholic drinks are really expnsive. A glass of wine is around $8 and a regular beer like Peroni will cost you around $4.50. 

Seating is limited here. The staff is friendly and helpful. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone."
,,,,,,,,,"I think Antico alone has added a few inches to my waist, and I'm totally okay with that. But who wouldn't? Their exemplary zas can make grumpy old men moan with happiness, and grown folks like me giggle like a little child watching that show with those walking, talking creepy-as-f*** vegetables. 



Seriously, though, my lady and I devour an entire pie about every other week or so, and Antico's pizzas make our lives that much better. 

***** 

I. FOOD & DRINK 

Can't really go wrong with any of the pies here. Why? Well, they consistently make amazing dough that comes out wonderfully soft and beautifully airy. And the sauce? It has a great balance of sugar, salt, and spice. Whatever else you put on it, it's bound to be great. Oh, and the cheeses they use are fantastic as well. Pizzas I've destroyed: 



*Capriciossa: with mushroom, artichoke, prosciutto cotto, and bufala, it's easily one of my favorites. Earthy, savory, cheesy, and fleshy - it has it all. 



*Diavola: spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala - spicy, meaty pizza is always good. A favorite as well. 



*San Gennaro: with salsiccia, sweet red pepper, bufala, and cippoline, this baby also rocks. 



Regarding drinks, they have your basic Coke products, as well as different flavored San Pellegrino's. But the real kick-a***ness is that patrons are allowed to BYOB. So, you'll see people bring in some nice bottles of reds - even with their own glasses sometimes - and get down. 



BTW, across the street, they have this gorgeous, quaint pasticceria ideal for fun dates with a loved one during the Spring, Summer or Fall. Shoot, I sort of like this building more than the pizza joint. Things to know: they have some bomb as hell coffee, as well as marvelous cannolis. Can't go wrong with the gelato either. Oh, and definitely take advantage of the scooter they have outside. A chubby dude like me looks ridiculous on one of those things. 



II. SERVICE 

For whatever reason, the service... well, is poor. During the handful of times I've waited in line - either during the weekday or weekend - there always seems to be an issue. It's either one of the following: 



1) The cashiers enter the incorrect order, and we have to accept a pizza that was not the one you wanted because when you complain about it they say they can't do anything; 



2) Your pizzas are taken by other people that claim to have the same name. 



3) The cashiers exude snarky, eye-rolling rudeness (which I usually don't mind). If the service was fast or even consistent, I would let a lot of things slide. But it's not. 



I do admit, though, three of the eight or so times I've been there no problems have occurred. They seem to be rare, though. 



III. ATMOSPHERE/ DÉCOR 

It's Hunger Games-like when that line forms, and the steaming inside seating area is scarce. Opt to take the pizzas to go, unless you visit during non-peak hours. 



IV. PRICES 

Pizzas run around $20 or north of it. The deliciousness is definitely worth your hard earned cash, though. 



V. OVERALL 

Absolutely stunning flavas, but the chaos and rudeness are ridiculous. So, my lady and I use Favor to have someone get the pizzas for us. That runs us about $10+, for someone to do that. And we think that it's worth it."
,,,,,,,,,"We love the pizza, beer and ambiance at this spot! The last time we came the pizza was a bit crisper on the bottom but hey no worries, when you're cranking out hundreds of pizzas a night things happen but the toppings are the main thing to me! Now that's it warmer, it's time to make another visit!"
,,,,,,,,,"We so wanted to try this pizza place but they refused to make a pizza without cheese. I know, I know, what's pizza without cheese? When you have an allergy to dairy, you get cheese less pizza. Everyone accommodates for this accept Antico's... not only did the say no, they were so rude when they said it. Just sad!"
13999372,3,4.5,10,10,7,10,10,10,"The hype is under rated... easily the best pizza and atmosphere in my entire life. 



Fast and friendly, subtle flavors in the sauce and crust. I will come back here everyone I'm in Atlanta!"
,,,,,,,,,"I love thin crust and the pizza here is almost perfect. It's floppy and loaded with cheese. The ones we got were slightly burnt on the bottom, but I'm not sure if that's their signature style or what, but burnt bottom isn't my thing. Overall, it still tasted good. The lasagna pizza was $21 and the Margherita was $20 (which tasted like a meatless version of the lasagna pizza). 



There's a seating area in the back of the restaurant next to the open kitchen. You'll have to share the bench seating if you want to dine in. It was packed when I came for dinner on a week night. Since it's located near a college, you can expect to see a lot of college students here. 



It's BYOB but they also offer an Italian beer called Peroni for $4.50 a bottle and wine for $6/glass. 



There's a small parking lot and we were lucky enough to snag the last spot when we arrived. There's also street parking out front."
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza here is actually very good. However I have come 4 times now and ever single time the same employee is extremely rude, to the point that I can't enjoy my meal afterwards. 



Only most recent, and last visit, there was an extremely long line out the door. After waiting for almost 45 minutes to my dismay I am helped by the same RUDE girl who always happens to be available during my turn. This time she began counting her tip jar in the middle of me ordering my pizza, and made me wait until she had finished counting her personal tips to reorder and pay. 



I don't think I have ever before been treated with such disrespect. 



Save yourself the frustration."
11222872,63,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Marinara pizza is very good, the Verdura pizza also, good crust, cheese also good. Place is very italian and good decorarion, cookers are good."
,,,,,,,,,The pizza's and calzone's we fabulous. Best tasting pizza I have ever had. The menu was all in Italian and the only beer they sold was the Italian beer Peroni. The food is cooked right in the same place where people eat and is served on giant cooking trays. No plates. The experience was worth it.
,,,,,,,,,"THIS PIZZA OMG JUST GO 



also gelato place across the street. I've been to Italy. Might as well just stay home in ATL since Antico is here."
,,,,,,,,,I still think this is the best pizza in ATL . It just is!! Went here recently after a falcons game and got right in -no lines! Got the pizza w peppers and meat on it. Kick to it but not too spicy. The communal tables work well. Do wish they had more drinks bc we didn't BYOB coming from the game. This place still does it right
,,,,,,,,,"If they awarded Michelin stars for pizza places this is the place that would get them. 



Best pizza I've ever had 



Margarita is out of this world. 



Even my toddler son said ""mmm so yummy"""
,,,,,,,,,"I have been here several times, each time thinking this will be better than the last time. I don't really concur with others raving about the pizza. It is ok pizza at best. To me the pizza is chewy and way too thin. It's inconsistent as well, sometimes the bottom of the pizza is burnt and eating it feels like chewing on charcoal bits. Other time the pizza is soggy and lacks flavor/sauce. The only saving grace is the free extra sauce you can request to dip the pizza in. Also, the menu is very limited as you cannot customize. I don't eat pork and the only pizza I can get is the margherite, which is the tomato basil, which you only get maybe about 3 leaves of basil on the whole pie. There are better pizza places in ATL, for more reasonable prices."
,,,,,,,,,"Why does the service at this family of restaurants have to be so terrible???? 



I love their pizza. It is my favorite in the city. The margherita pizza is simple and perfect. Unfortunately I am blown away by the unfriendliness of the cashiers every time I come. Rude on the phone and offensively rude in person. I took some family yesterday and walked up to the counter and said hello. The young woman literally did not look up and just walked away. After an awkward minute, the woman at the neighboring register called for next guest, but she was equally rude. 



I love your pizza, but PLEASE give your staff some customer service training."
,,,,,,,,,"This has become an Atlanta staple. We've been coming here for years now. Amazing vibes and even better pizza. Love that it's BYOB. If you like spicy, you can't go wrong w/ the Diavola. The lasagna pizza is pretty great too."
,,,,,,,,,This place is Soo over rated. athantic italian pizza they don't have olives for a topping. Italy is known for olives
,,,,,,,,,"This is the best pizza in ATL. Not sure how it has a lower rating, perhaps it's the line to get food, or the lack of seating/parking, but that's part of the experience in my opinion. Their white pizza is my favorite followed by the diavlolo. The BYOB without a corkage fee is an exceptional way to deal with them only serving beer and soft drinks/water. The crust is typical wood fire cooked Italian style pizza. They have a toppings bar inside the kitchen with garlic, peppers, olive oil, etc. You can also watch the staff cook the pizza and prepare everything as the seating goes inside the kitchen. It's truly an experience. Price is about $20-25 a pie, which is steeper than others, but you're getting an extra large pizza."
,,,,,,,,,"Great pizza, TERRIBLE service. Try to ignore the rude employees and just focus on the delicious, fresh pizza!"
,,,,,,,,,The service speed and politeness was satisfactory. The pizza had an interesting flavor (never had sweet peppers on mine before) that was filling and had that great ooey gooeyness some pizza places have.
,,,,,,,,,Just tried to make a phone order. The woman took my order like they were going to make them and I asked what the wait would be. She told me there is no wait so I said ok can you start them in 10 minutes. Then she tells me they don't start them until you actually get there then she hung up on me! So rude!!
,,,,,,,,,"My husband and I were in town just for the weekend and saw so many great reviews about Antico that we had to try it! We ordered the San Gennaro to split and found ourselves a seat in the kitchen area. I loved that you could watch them make pizza! Less than 2 minutes later our pizza was ready and delivered to us. Crazy fast! It came on a giant sheet pan which ended up being my plate. I think that's what others did as well. Over by the kitchen they have extras of toppings such as fresh garlic, red pepper, grated Parmesan and more. 

We had originally planned to have tap water but once we found out it was from a sink that people wash their hands in the kitchen seating area we decided to buy a bottle. It would be nice to have a separate fountain just for drinking water. Even if it's from the tap. 



The pizza was good but not the best Napoli pizza I've had. Maybe I was hyped up too much and excited expecting something so amazing. Side note: the pizza is good cold leftover the next day. My husband disagrees with me and thought it was the best he's ever had. 

I'd suggest going if you're in Atlanta as it is good. But since I live near a Cane Rosso (in Texas) I would definitely choose to go there instead if I had the choice."
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza is one of the best in Atlanta. I'll give them that. But unfortunately you can't enjoy it if you try to eat in the restaurant. 



We had a party of 8 there for a birthday on Saturday night around 6. Our pizza came quickly and we are quickly. Within 15 minutes of sitting down the manager kicked us out to open up the seats. We'd just opened our second beers. Not welcoming at all, and put a damper on the evening. 



I was there 5 years ago and instead of forcing people out of the restaurant, the owner was giving free Canolis to everyone to celebrate a birthday. Sad to see how times have changed."
,,,,,,,,,The pizza here is pretty but lacks flavor. The pizza is not made fresh when you order which I think is another reason why they do not allow ANY substitutions or half pizzas. My pizza was cold. The crust was burnt and all the ingredients fell off. Also beware of the dinner and lunch rushes. The place gets extremely loud. There is nowhere to sit and minimal parking. I was very disappointed after looking at the reviews and seeing the pictures everyone posted.
,,,,,,,,,"Until this last visit, I had regarded Antico as my favorite Neapolitan style pizza outside of Naples. When I walked in the door I was greeted by the rare scent of cooking pizzas that is rarely found in pizzerias. 



The dining room that faces the ovens is great fun, but my Margherita came out very quickly, and was quite haphazard in appearance. A scant amount of sauce and a very doughy pie really left me cold on this experience. The sauce dumped on in a swirl, and not evenly applied, leaving the a good third of the outside of the pie topped with nothing(I posted a photo). This isn't consistent with past pies, and is a sign of careless pizza-making."
,,,,,,,,,"My friend and I came here on a Saturday at about 12:45. I parked in the back of the restaurant where there was additional parking. I was happy that we didn't have to wait long to order. We shared a small margherita pizza which cost $20. It was a little pricey, but the pizza was really good. The portion was also pretty big for a small. The pizza came out very fast and it was nice and hot too. They have little condiments such as oil, Italian seasonings, cheese, pepper flakes, etc that you can add to your pizza. Each table had cups but I wish they had ice water. We ended up filling our cups at the sink which I assumed was for drinking water. It was busy, but we snagged a spot at a high top table. Overall very tasty and super cute place. Would definitely come back!"
,,,,,,,,,The food is to die for. But service today left a lot to be desired. The two girls at the counter were more concerned with carrying on their conversation with their male friend than to help customers. When they finally gave us attention there was a strange attitude... And as long as we were there (45 minutes while eating) they continued to entertain their friend
,,,,,,,,,"I always eat pizza hear! Best pie in the city, I only wish i could add mushrooms to any pie."
,,,,,,,,,"Hard to find many better pizza restaurants than Antico. It's some combination of the food and the ambiance. It can get crowded, so take-out isn't a bad idea, but you need to sit and eat in the restaurant for the full experience."
,,,,,,,,,"Omg! Best meal during Irma evacuation from FL. Best pizza, better than NY Grimaldi, dare say. Good ingredients with perfect brick oven crust. Would be worth a stop again after a drive of 7 hrs from Fl."
,,,,,,,,,My favourite pizza joint in the US - hands down. They imported brick ovens from Italy. They serve family-style and offer BYOB so a great spot! I also love how casual the atmosphere is here. It's a great hidden spot in Atlanta.
,,,,,,,,,"Antico is one of my favorite pizza places in Atlanta. The ovens are imported from Italy and it's got a really fun vibe. The majority of the tables are literally in the kitchen and it's BYOB so you can bring a bottle of wine or a couple beers and have a good time. 



Last night I got the lasagna pizza, which is decent but the diavola is my favorite. The san gennaro is also pretty good. 



As cool of a place as this is, don't ever try to go here with a group. It's always crowded, and the seating is terrible for groups. It's also not the best place for a date, at least a first date, because odds are you might end up sharing a table with randos and it could get awkward real fast."
,,,,,,,,,"So disappointing. The pizza was limp lol no folding this one, all your toppings will fall off. The dough was very rubbery and almost raw in the center. Nothing special. The hole in the wall trend with Italian music and a menu you can't understand must be it's appeal. I'm from NYC and I'm looking for great pizza, but this place isn't it."
,,,,,,,,,"Possibly the best pizza I've ever had. Really authentic but also fast so you don't have to wait forever. Only issue is seating can be hard especially if you have more than 2 or 3 people in your group, but well worth any wait for seating."
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza was good, large quantity but a little pricey. Their beer selection was not good and all the drinks were served warm. Fast service with plenty of seating. I would go back if I was in Atlanta and hopefully the beer would be colder."
,,,,,,,,,amazing. i love pizza and this place was great the crust is amazing ! visiting from miami because of hurricane irma and this is the spot!
,,,,,,,,,"Great pizza...lets start there. I would give it a 5 star rating...but I dropped one because they won't let you customize your pizza. Not sure why to be honest. Despite that little annoyance the pizza is delicious and the setting is neat. I also feel better about the 4 star because the girl working the cash register and taking orders was not very friendly and was literally playing on her phone as we were asking her questions about the menu...very unprofessional and rude. They should ""fix that glitch."" 



All in all would definitely go here again, the dough/crust is YUM YUM YUMMY."
,,,,,,,,,"I'm gonna be honest. I'm an Asian American student, not a pizza connoisseur. If you were to hold me at gunpoint and ask me where Naples is, I won't be able tell you. But I will give you my honest opinion, free of glitter and fancy words. 



The restaurant is always busy around the clock; the line was out the door when my party got there (5pm on a Saturday). Wait time however was pretty quick, and seats weren't all too hard to find. It's BYOB, but if you forget, they also sell a few beverages, like pellegrino. If you're too cheap for drinks, they have plastic cups at each table, and faucet water to drink (literally they pointed to a faucet when I asked for water). 



They don't come short when it comes to the quality of ingredients. The whole business is entirely transparent. There's a rack of proofing dough in plain sight when you walk into the dining room, and ovens blazing in the back. The toppings were even top notch qualities, the pickled peppers were tasty, garlic was fresh, and the parmesan was good (I got an extra cup to eat separately). 



The pizzas are roughly $20 a pie. That's kinda pricey, for a student like me. It's roughly a medium size delivery pizza, and can feed 2 people comfortably (they're not that small). From what I read in the reviews, there are 3 pizzas that yelpers would die for. If you wanna be safe, go for the margherita pizza. If you're fine with anything, get the San Gennaro. If you're a bit adventurous, order the Diavola. The pizzas come out really quick, so find seats ASAP. 



DIAVOLA - $21 

So I ordered the diavola pizza with my girlfriend. The pizza was topped with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. In English, it was topped with some fancy pepperoni, spicy peppers, and fancy mozzarella cheese (sorry guys). The sopressata salami tasted a lot like regular pepperoni, just a tad bit more fattier and more savory, but not a whole lot difference. The peppers were a nice addition, and had a little sweetness that added to the pizza. The bufala tasted like regular mozzarella, I couldn't really tell the difference. The problem I had with this pizza was that it was really salty. I didn't taste any balance in flavors, just the saltiness from the sopressata. To add to that, the pizza was a bit on the dry side and oily on top, contributing to the need for water or some other beverage. The crust was a bit thick for me, compared to the rest of the pizza. 



I tried the margherita pizza, which I thought was better than the diavola pizza. It was simple and classic: not much you can mess up on. Also, try to eat the pizzas as quickly as possible, as they tend to turn soggy the longer you wait. In the end, I wasn't amazed by the pizzas, they were just okay. Basically my two cents is this: as a yelper virgin to authentic Italian food, I'm not sure if this place is worth the hype. I will definitely visit this place again when I'm in the area, but for now, I'd suggest trying one of the other amazing restaurants in Midtown."
,,,,,,,,,One of the best pizzas I've had. The dough was interesting. The flavor was just right. There's a great gelato across the street which they also owns. And you can order to have them bring it to the caffe since the seating is very limited at their pizzeria.
,,,,,,,,,Amazing. Closest I've ever tasted to pizza in Naples Italy. Lasagna pizza was my favorite! The place is byob but still very family friendly.
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza taste different from your typical American pizza places (mellow mushroom, pizza hut ect) I would say it taste more like the pizza that is sold in Europe. Cant really say if its better or worse but it is definitely different. I didn't like the seating arrangements. There are several huge tables and you have to sit alongside other patrons. Not a favorite of mine but I will join friends to go eat there if they suggest it."
,,,,,,,,,"I believe it's BYOB. The sitting is very European traditional with big tables and you sit next to strangers, kinda odd at first. The pizza is crunchy enough, but soft at the same time. I enjoyed watching the process of how the pizza was made. My favorite pizza joint in all of Atlanta"
,,,,,,,,,Pizza is good but not going here again after reading about the ill treatment the employees received.
,,,,,,,,,"Hands down, some of the best pizza I have ever had. I have been to hundreds of pizza places all over the world, and this sh*t right here?! I'm not even a big pizza person, but this has me thinking otherwise. You get to watch the kitchen go to work as you wait for your pizza, the atmosphere is authentic and not too crowded on a Monday, and you can also walk across the road and get gelato! I will tell my grandchildren about this place one day"
,,,,,,,,,"Pros: 

Not a bad price for some of the best pizza in Atlanta. 



Cons: 

They're too hip to give you plates so you have to eat on shitty paper towels. 

It gets really crowded in there and they pack you in really close together so don't bring a large group. I've seen people in there who had to eat their pizza standing up. 

No table service. 



Pizzas come in a large size only. 



Notes: 

BYOB"
,,,,,,,,,"Illinois guy here and yep, those ARE five stars! Tender crust that you have to fold to eat is my favorite pizza and so far in my long life of eating pizzas, Antico is the best example I have ever had. 



It is not greasy, even if you go with the meat-and-ricotta laden Lasagna pizza like we had. We also had the base model Margerita. The quick hot oven method means no charring that you find in ""coal fired"" ovens which I find disgusting. Plus it comes out in 10 minutes which is bonus. 



BYOB plus the good selection of sparkling waters made Antico a five star selection pertaining to consumables. 



Now. I am no longer 25 years old and don't dig the whole 'park it where you can' seating methodology of the place. It is chaos in Antico. But you can also ask them to send your pies out to the lounge across the street where you can dine in relative comfort and sip the nicest lemoncellos I have ever had. Wish I knew that coming in. Oh well, next time."
,,,,,,,,,"Absolutely delicious fresh pizza. Classic style. There are also different 'condiments' such as pepper marinara, fresh garlic, olive oil, pepper flakes, parmesan, etc. super packed at times, especially after games, but totally worth the wait!!!"
,,,,,,,,,"Not great. Too much hype. At least it is so, with the one located at Avalon. The dough was a bit unevenly cooked, parts of it was burned. The Peroni out of the tap, not good. I've had the bottles in Europe and was much, much better. For pizza like this kind, go to Vero on Dresden in Brookhaven. And order the Meatball Pizza."
,,,,,,,,,"It tasted like the basic drunk food pizza. I have had way better and would actually prefer Ginos over this place. Not sure what the hype is about. 



I also hated the set up of the place. It's just some ugly oversized picnic type tables. Not exactly a place you would want to dine at. This is something you would likely want to buy as take out."
,,,,,,,,,I was in the area and decided to drop in. I had the margarita pizza with pepperoni and it was delicious. I love authentic brick oven pizza and this restaurant didn't disappoint. I will definitely return when I have more time.
,,,,,,,,,"Do you like pizza? Authentic pizza? Mind having a little wine w/ur pizza? Mind watching ur pizza come to life? If I could have dinner here every Saturday night, I would! In fact I may have to make that a new years reso. Ultra cute date spot or THEE most mature, casual, metropolitan place to be on a Saturday night. And the pizza, did I mention how freakin' great the pizza is here?!?"
,,,,,,,,,"What an interesting place. It definitely caters to the college crowd but families and singles can easily fit in as well. don't expect fancy and don't expect them to cater to your pickiness. Do expect excellent pizza. It's some of the best I've ever had. The menu is limited with just pizza, pizza or ... pizza. Seating is limited. Expect to share a table with many - or stand as you eat on crowded nights. It's definitely an experience worth trying."
,,,,,,,,,"You order what you would like as soon as you walk in, and are given a number. After ordering, you walk into the dining area, where the seating is ""first come first serve"" picnic style benches and tables. 



Walking in the dining area you instantly smell the delicious scent of a brilliantly made pizza. You hear sounds of Italian opera and people laughing and talking. You see two brick ovens with amazing goodness in them and an open kitchen with smiling pizza chefs. Your pizza is delivered to you by number calling, and the rest is easy. You laugh, you smile, you eat, and you drink (it's BYOB). 



The pizza is made traditional Italian style and is the absolute BEST in Atlanta. Being from New York City, I'm quite the critic, but when it comes to Antico I have nothing negative to say."
,,,,,,,,,Excellent pizza! We stopped in before a campus visit and we loved our lunch! Our pizza was awesome! It tasted just like Pizza from Italy!
,,,,,,,,,"I have to agree with the recent posts that said the pizza was ""ok"". It was good but nothing to scream about. The dough was tasty and slightly chewy like an Indian nan type of flatbread for the crust ( describing what it was like texture wise). 



The prices were outrageous for pizza as were their small 6.5 oz coke bottles for $2.75 each. You cannot make any substitutions at all, out of the question when I asked. 



The 4 cheese calzone was noting like a typical calzone, a real disappointment and oozing oil that made the bottom soggy after 5 minutes. The pizza has no crispness under but rather a softer texture which also got soggy after 5 minutes. 



For 1 pizza and 1 calzone to cost over $50.00 with a few sodas, I would of expected a lot better. If you see my other reviews, I never mind spending $$$$ on food but for Pizza, it's a ton of hype or a ton of people who haven't had other Italian pizza from real Italians ( not a single one here, they all spoke Spanish in back ). 



The gelato across the street was also ok. No tasting allowed so don't ask and the salted caramel had ZERO salt flavor, just tasted like bland caramel, so nothing special and definitely not salted as it should be. 



Save your money. Don't get me wrong, it was ok, nothing bad, but I wouldn't be jumping up and down telling people to go here."
,,,,,,,,,I think the pizza is decent but it's a bit hyped up. Seating is a bit of a challenge as it can get very packed.The struggle is real. Especially when all you want to do is eat pizza. Hot. The way it should be.
,,,,,,,,,"As far as pizza goes, you can't really get much better than Antico. The pricing is expensive but in return you get great quality and a pretty large pizza. Two of my girl friends and I split the $22 San Gennaro pizza which had Italian sausage, sweet red pepper, mozzarella, and onions. It was so large that we were all full and still had another slice left over. Another great thing about this place is that it's BYOB and provide plastic cups so we brought 2 bottles of wine to go with our meal. The seating is also worth noting since it's communal, family style seating. 



The parking situation isn't bad as they have several little lots that you can park at. We parked at the Antico corporate office lot. What's also cool about this place is that you can walk across the way to ""Caffe Gio"" (owned by the same company that runs Antico) to get some gelato for dessert."
,,,,,,,,,"This pizza is the real deal. We came here for lunch while visiting ATL and this place didn't disappoint. The atmosphere was very casual and the food arrived quickly. They also have self serve tables with toppings like olive oil, Italian peppers, fresh garlic, parmesan cheese, etc. The ingredients were fresh, simple, and incredibly tasty. You wouldn't think that Downtown Atlanta would be home to an authentic Italian place like this, but it is. We'll definitely be stopping by next time we're in town."
,,,,,,,,,"Pizza is all about the crust and they have it nailed. It's a little yeasty and bubbles up along the sides and sometimes in the middle, and those huge ovens must crank out crazy heat because they come out with a beautiful char on the bottom without overcooking the tops. I've had quite a few different pizzas there and not have been less than terrific. Add to that the good-but-inexpensive wines and the chill atmosphere and it's a total winner."
,,,,,,,,,Amazing pizza!!!! I thought I was in heaven. The crust and ingredients were delicious!!
,,,,,,,,,"If this is the best pizza in Atlanta then I'm sorry for the people that live here... it was the worst pizza I've ever had. The experience as well was horrible. The people at the front were rude. 

The pizza comes in one size (large) and it only took 10 minutes to make. We took it home because the place was completely pack and no where to sit. People were standing up and eating. They don't give you plates so you eat out of the box( not a bad thing but not what I expected from the #1 pizza joint in Atlanta). 

We got home and the pizza was already cold. It was a 10 minute drive home.... The crust seemed to be pre-made and was burnt on the bottom. The pepperoni is in chunks so you get crust little sauce and a mouthful of just pepperoni. 



I don't understand how this is rated number one. If you know good pizza, I do not recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,,"Pizza was great! It is as closely authentic to the pizza in Florence and Naples, Italy. I would recommend eating here if you want an authentic italian experience without actually visiting italy."
,,,,,,,,,"You would never think that Atlanta would have awesome let alone decent pizza...but they do. 

I would put it up there with NY/NJ/CT pizza. 

We were visiting friends in the area and they kept talking about this spot. We were hesitant since we are obnoxious NJians and nothing can compare with our pizza and Italian restaurants. I stand corrected. Antico Pizza is the real deal. Their pizza is so freaking good! 

It's a no frills spot. Parking across the st. Owned from what I can guess by true Neapolitans. Diego Maradona jersey when he played for Napoli to prove it. 

You order your pie and go to the back in communal seating to eat it. You can watch them make it and it's a nice show. Minimal ingredients. Superb toppings (we got a pepperoni and a plain). The pies are very filling and the dough is unreal. 

I had no problems with their service as I read with some reviews. And it didn't take a long time to get the pizza. What I do know is the place has killer lines during lunch time. We went off peak (3 in the afternoon). It's a must for pizza in the Atlanta area! ENJOY!"
,,,,,,,,,"THE BEST PIZZA IN THE CITY! The san genarro takes a run at Chicago deep dish for the best pizza I have ever had. The other pizzas are very good, but I have tried them all and will only get the san genarro from now on. Pricey but completely worth it."
,,,,,,,,,"I've been back to this highly rated pizza joint several times since the big build up, then subsequent disappointment me and my mother experienced from the wait, to the pizza being thin, soggy, and just not good. 



I had hoped to experience the pizza promised by the high number of fans. But no. Nothing changed. What I see is a restaurant that probably delivered in quality and experienced before it got hit with high reviews and explosive amount of business. And it has just not delivered he quality pizza, probably because it has too much business. Ironic huh? 



Specifically, I've been back 4 more times since my first review. And 4 times I've gotten pizza that's thin, soggy, sometimes okay, but never close to the expectations set by the reviews I see. I'm still looking for the ultimate pizza experience in Atlanta, but sadly, Antico doesn't deliver. I say this because I would be overjoyed if it delivered pizza as good as the reviews I've seen. 



In my opinion, it's and over rated victim of its own early success."
,,,,,,,,,"Antico's Pizza with our friends from Korea. 

They loved the pizza here. We ordered 4 different ones to try out. We ordered the Lasagna, Margherita D.O. P., Diavola, and San Gennaro. 



The Margherita pizza has San Marzano tomato, bufala, basil and garlic on it. My fave! I usually ask for more fresh basil and lay it on my pizza, fold my pizza over and dip it in the oil that I make. I use spicy olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese to make a dipping sauce. It is a bit spicy but I love a pizza with a kick. 



The Lasagna pizza has meatballs, ricotta and romano on it. This was my fiancé's favorite one. 



The San Gennaro has salsiccia, sweet red pepper, bufala and cipolline on it. This was the least popular one. 



The Diavola has spicy sopressata, pepperonata and bufala on it. This was our friend's fave one. It was a bit spicy so you really don't need the spicy oil dip for this one! He liked it because it was spicy. 



I was super hungry when I ordered 4. It was way too much pizza for 4 people. Next time we will order 2. Their portion is large, their pizza is not small. 



Seating is always a problem here. We waited a while to find seats. I wish they would do something about this seating issue at Antico's. I love the pizza but seating is such a pain to deal with. Buttttttttt I will be back for this yummy pizza!!"
,,,,,,,,,"I agree with Brenda H.'s review below. I have NO idea what all the hype is about with this place. It truly baffles me. There is no question in my mind that I've had better pizza in the city of Atlanta and its surrounding area. Now, don't get me wrong -- the pizza is fine. The ingredients are fresh, the crust/dough is flavorful, the restaurant has lots of character. The service is quick. Although you will most likely encounter long lines, you will not wait long for food at all. 



I've had the San Gennaro and Diavola pizzas. If I find myself at Antico again in the near future (because, let's face it, everybody seems to want to check this place out nowadays...so I'm sure friends will make me go again at some point) I will try one of the white pizzas. Perhaps I just haven't stumbled upon my perfect pizza at Antico :-( 



Pros: prompt service, welcoming environment, community seating 

Cons: long lines"
,,,,,,,,,"I enjoy going to authentic pizzerias, however this place misses the mark when it comes to a veritable spot for a taste of Italy. Sure, there's a brick oven visible, but the pizza taste pre made and not fresh. The menu is small. If you do not eat pork, well, your only option is the Margherita Pizza, which lacked full flavor. The food was good, but not great. The staff was friendly and I appreciate there was free parking, considering the location. I really love that customers can 'bring their own bottle of wine- YAY for BYOB! Afterwards if you're in the mood for dessert, you can head across the street for some expensive gelato. Overall the place was decent considering, this is Georgia, unlike up north where authentic pizzeria spots are plentiful. I would go back, with an extra bottle of dry wine and mini bottles of vodka to drown out my sorrow of the thought that this place pre makes the pizza and uses that brick oven for decor. Blah."
,,,,,,,,,"Rude phone person, walking in at 9:53 she says, we close at 10 pm 

I said excuse me? It's still 9:53 she rolls her eyes 

I said "" I don't think you need our business 

Sorry that I had to drive to your place"
,,,,,,,,,"Very good pizza. Went there with my three boys and was served fast fast even though it was packed. There was a condiment station where you could get Parmesan cheese, Red pepper flakes and fresh basil to put on top of your pizza. It was really good quality stuff. They also had several different types of my favorite sparkling citrus sodas San Pellegrino along with Coke and water. After we sat down, I noticed that other people had brought in wine so it must be a BYOB as well. 



Parking was a bear but afterwards we walked over to a gelato restaurant that's right across the street and had gelato. This is part of the same company. Unfortunately it was raining but they was a really nice patio with beach umbrellas outside that would've been great on a sunny day 



Nice place."
,,,,,,,,,This pizza is sooo good! I always bring people visiting from out of town here and they always love it. Overall I love the environment and love that you can see them making the pizza BUT there is definitely not enough seating. I wish the seating was a little bit better and that it was better for bringing my kids along.
9384282,50,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,"One pizza is huge! The three of us got the San Gennaro, which was quite delicious and big enough for 3 of people. I wasn't a huge fan of the crust because it was kind of burnt but I can still dig it. 



The seating is free for all and you eat off of napkins. It can get pretty warm in the summer and you're sitting close to a lot of people. 



It's BYOB and you have little plastic cups at your tables, which is awesome. I asked someone working there for a wine opener and I had to open it myself, which is chill, but they could've helped. 



Parking can be scarce during peak hours."
,,,,,,,,,"Best wood fire pizza in Atlanta! Being half Italian and living in Italy for 3 years of my young, impressionable life, has made me an underrated expert in pizza, ya know? Maybe not, but I do know good pizza and Antico is it! Nothing beats the classic margherita pizza, but I've also tried no slice I didn't like. I prefer partnering my pie with the accompaniment of a flavored sanpelligrino--which they have a good selection of--and then a side dish of more pizza! Antico is authentic Italian and doesn't fluff up their pizza with msg, heavy dough, or too much cheese. They use fresh imported ingredients and make it hot every time! 



Oh, and the gelato/coffee joint next door is the PERFECT place to finish off your meal. It is equally as excellent (and shares the same owners)."
,,,,,,,,,"The best pizza I have had outside of Italy! The food itself is unbelievable (you can never go wrong with anything that you order) and the atmosphere of the restaurant itself totally adds to the authentic vibes. Try to eat in the area around the open wood-fired stove if you can. This is a must try, even if you're just visiting for a day!"
,,,,,,,,,"I'm not from Atlanta but this pizza is remarkable. Soft, delicious crust, solid ingredients, and no heartburn dripping grease. Solid pizza, and the wait on a Friday evening was impeccable for such a fresh made pizza."
,,,,,,,,,"First time here. Had to try this place out since there were over 2000 reviews, most positive. As you walk in, you order at the counter and find your seat. As my brother was ordering the pizza, I looked for seats. Found some within 5mins. A friendly couple was kind enough to slide over so 6 of us can sit together. We were there on a Monday evening around 7:30pm and the place was full. We were excited, super hungry and tired from all the walking during the day. 



As we were looking around, we thought that the pizza was huge so we decided to just order one pizza since I typically eat only a slice or two of pizza. We ordered the San Gennaro first. It came out in less than 15mins. We started eating it and decided to go ahead and order another one. We ordered the Margherita. Both were the most popular ones we've seen. 



Overall, I thought the pizza was just okay. It wasn't anything as exciting as people said. I would have liked for the crust to be a little more crispy. Having said that, the taste of it was good. It wasn't salty or anything. I would say, I would be back to try the other pizzas they have. I loved how they severed it to us in a big pan and it is a great place to be with your friends, just hanging out."
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza here is fantastic! Love the crust, love the sauce, love the flavors! 

I have had some rude service from the ladies upfront and it can be really crowded and chaotic at dinner hours. Last time I ordered to-go thinking that would solve all of my problems but the pizza was soggy and sad by the time I got home. 

Great pizza- eat in the restaurant and don't expect great service. 



I like Amazza over in Edgewood more because they do everything right. 

The service, atmosphere and of course the ZA!"
,,,,,,,,,"This is the best Italian pizza you can find in Atlanta. It is out of this world good! Everything is fresh, the dough is made there as is the sauce and mozzarella. The Margherita pizza is my personal favorite and I add extra fresh basil on top. Also, be sure to make your own mix of olive oil, Parmesan, and peppers to dip your crust in. You won't be disappointed. You almost can't go here ever without waiting, but it really is worth it. It can be tough to find a place to sit (it's shared seating in a small room, actually you're eating in the kitchen!) but my husband and I have stood up at a counter at the edge of the kitchen many times and loved the experience and atmosphere! Also, it's BYOB (but they do sell some there too) so bring a bottle of wine or a six pack of beer! My husband and I always bring a bottle of wine and it makes the experience even more fun. To top it off, the gelato/bakery across the street is part of Antico as well and their cannolis are amazing!"
,,,,,,,,,"My pizza had a hair, now I understand why! Disgusting pizzas, disgusting employee and disgusting place. I will never go back there"
,,,,,,,,,"Probably the best pizza in Atlanta! 

I had the Margherita and it was soooo good! 

Their menu is quite short but for me it's a very good point, a sign of freshness. 

I cannot recommend it enough."
,,,,,,,,,"This is a delicious pizza! We visited at a time when there was no crowd and we were able to park in front. The woman at the counter was sufficient, not informative but kind of took it that you could read the menu and go from there. 

We ordered a margherita with mushrooms. 

The pizza tasted fresh and the crust was the real champion. It was delicious! 



The pizza does come at a premium and it's worth it."
,,,,,,,,,My party got 2 pizzas. One of them was good but the other was meh. They're going to have to do one better for 20 a pop.
,,,,,,,,,A must! Definitely try the lasagna and margarita! BYOB so bring your own wine. Best pizza in Atlanta for sure
,,,,,,,,,"Casual pizza place Italian style! Super fast (assuming the line is short) and reasonable prices. I love the casual serve yourself water and sit wherever, love that's it's BYOB, and love the pizza even more. I dare you to try the hot peppers toppings! They're super spicy, but if you want a kick you will get it. 



Don't go on a Friday night, the lines are out the door! It's also a great date night spot, especially if you're a college kid or a youngin' without a ton of money! Parking can also be an issue, but it's not too bad. 



As for what to order- from the three pizzas I've tried, I've liked them all. Just decide what you're in the mood for!"
,,,,,,,,,"Came on a Friday.....B U S Y!!! tbis was my first time here and i kept hearing about it and we finally tried it. We got a Margarhita with mushrooms and it was AMAZING. its a nice atmosphere, lots of stuff going on but.....be warned. Parking is scarce and the line can be out the door. We ate, we talked and we left bc there were plenty of people waiting to find a seat. It took about 10 minutes for our pizza to be ready. Definitely worth a visit. Loved it!!"
,,,,,,,,,"A friend of ours was visiting from out of town and after a long day of apple picking and some rainy weather, we wanted nothing but to try Antico pizza. Our friends that live near Atlanta Station have visited Antico and have raved. We were nervous for the wait on a Saturday night but thankfully the line moved quickly. 



The concept is brilliant. Everyone orders at the counter and then finds themselves a seat in the main dining room with an open kitchen. 



We ordered Margherita with Funghi (mushrooms) and Pomodorini for the 5 of us. (On another day, 2 pies wouldn't have been enough for 5 adults but this particular day we were all semi-full from a day of non stop eating.) We found seating quickly and promptly opened our bottle of wine. Antico is BYOB, bring your own booze, but I believe they sell beer. Just to be ""safe"", we brought our own wine opener and would recommend others to do the same. 



The pizza was brought out, soon after order, by one of the servers that walk around calling the order numbers. The pizza is served on a large sheet pan. Once we had our first bite, we were fans. 



From BYOB, ordering food at the counter and seat yourself, serving pizza on sheet pans rather than plates all enhances the concept and emphasizes serving the best food possible. And Antico excels at pizza. Having tasted true Italian pizza in Italy, this is the place for fantastic pizza in Atlanta."
,,,,,,,,,"This is amazing pizza. Probably the 2nd best pizza I have ever had in my life (and that does include Italy). This place has the art of the neapolitan pizza down. My friends weren't kidding, this really is the best pizza in Atlanta. 



What is super great about is that they sell wine and Perino for you to wash the pizza down with. 



What is also amazing is that the pizza comes out in 2 minutes (talk about lightening fast). 



So why not 5 star: - LOGISTICS. 



We were lucky (coming at around 2PM) that we were able to find seating, but about 3PM, there was an insane line outside the door. At a certain point they were pretty much crushing people in the dining room. Even at Lombardi's (in NYC - the first pizza place in America) it never got this crazy. I don't believe in making life miserable for customers. This is not Georgetown cupcakes."
,,,,,,,,,"Obviously, I'm the oddball on this review because both my husband and I were underwhelmed with this ""Fave"" and beloved pizza place in Atlanta. But, I'm sorry fellow foodies...this is not one of my ""Loves"". Primarily because we just didn't get enough flavor in our pies. Plus, the crust was just too soft for us. 



Granted, we're coming from a perspective of people who grew up on NYC pizza, so we're probably biased. If you're from the Northeast, then you know how crazy we can be about our pizza. Unfortunately, Antico just doesn't compare to little Italy Or our local, corner pizza spot (I promise...no shade, really). But, perhaps that's not the comparison I should be making, in all fairness. From an Atlanta perspective, I tend to like Rosa's Pizza downtown for a close NYC approximation. And, I wanted to love Antico's Bianca and Lasagna Pizzas so much, but I didn't :-(. But, PLEASE...if you are visiting Atlanta Or live in metro Atlanta, you have to try this place at least once and make your own decision. Happy Eating!"
,,,,,,,,,What a serious waste of $20. I ordered the calzoni and it was a greasy ball of dough loaded with curdy white cheese and 4 pieces of sausage and 3 pieces of broccoli rabe. The girls at the front were surly and only upon arrival did I find out that they don't cook your order until you arrive. Also the web site say they open at 11:00 so I ordered at 11:30 and arrived at 11:45 to find out they don't open until 12:00. Won't be back.
,,,,,,,,,"Authentic! Delicious! Apparently we'll-known but my first time here. While the pizza menu options are limited to pizzas on menu, they are excellent! Bring your own bottle or order wine or beer. Order at counter and then walk into kitchen and eat at the industrial- setting tables that are shared. Operatic Italian music and lots of laughter and friends. Love this."
,,,,,,,,,"Best pizza in Atlanta (and I've been told better than the pizza in itlay). 



Food: if you eat pork, I'd recommend the San Genarro. The peppers are both sweet and spicy and the sausage is perfectly cooked. If you don't eat pork, I'd go with the Pomodorini which is a white pizza with cherry tomatoes that are melting on top. All Antico pizzas have a thin crust with char on the edges. Most pizzas will run you about $20 and they feed 2 hungry people well (3 if you're not as hungry). 



PRO TIP: use the toppings station in the kitchen area. I like to mix garlic, Parmesan, red pepper, and olive oil. People who LIKE Antico don't use toppings. People who LOVE Antico do. 



Quirks: they won't change any pizza (substitutions, removing toppings, adding toppings, etc) so don't bother asking. 



Ambiance: this place is informal, crowded (unless you go at an off time), and loud. Listen carefully for your number. You'll eat off your pizza tray. There are rolls of paper towels to use as napkins. There are also cups that you can fill with water at the sinks if you don't buy a drink or BYO wine/beer which is allowed!). Don't worry if here's a long line out front since it moves faster than you think. There are tents and heaters to protect you from the weather. 



Overall this place is awesome if you want something casual and authentic."
,,,,,,,,,"For what this place is - a mid range pizza joint - it is fantastic. I got the margherita, and espresso from the place across the street, and some cheap beer. 



Note this is traditional neopolitan pizza. Thus thinner and wetter pizza."
,,,,,,,,,"There is something about Antico's pizza that other pizza places cannot mimic. 



Probably one of the best pizza in Atlanta if you come on a good day, if not, still good but not enough to ""wow"" you. 



Stopped by last night with wife and other couple to get a quick grub. Dropped in with a 6 pack of beer and ordered Sofia and Capriciosa Pizza. 



None of their pizzas packs heavy flavor but just right enough to have you taste all the aspects of ingredients that go into the pizza."
,,,,,,,,,"Made it back for a recent visit thanks to the chance for lunch with Kristin B - yay! It had been too long for me to be missing this pizza (and friend) love! 



It was busy but not as crazy as I worried it would be, about 1230 on a Thu. We were able to get a whole table to ourselves, and I noticed others mostly could as well. One note- right now, they are card only - I found that odd bc I would have expected the opposite, but just so you know if you go in the next bit, be prepared! 



Our margherita with mushrooms was delicious - and I scored the leftover piece!- and all is wonderful in the world of thin, just-right-blistered pizza. One note- I think our ""server"" (it's not the right title because it's a person taking the order at the front but I am not sure what to say - orderer-ee?) said we could only add one topping - we were going to do mush and pepperoni but had to pick....maybe we misunderstood but whatever happened, we only had one topping. Prob better we just went with the veg option! 



Need to get back more often, and certainly with good company who likes to share food!"
,,,,,,,,,"I was looking for a place to eat that was convenient to Terminal West. This place had excellent reviews and even though I'm not a huge pizza eater, my husband is. So when it came time to try a spot, and if it is going to be pizza, then it better be GOOD pizza. This place hit is on all cylinders. And even though it was on a street with 3 other pizza places, this place was steady busy with in house and to go orders. 

We got the Meatball pizza, and it was so tasty. Has that floppy, but still fully cooked, crust that is a favorite of new york style pizza lovers. 

Easy enough to find a table to share with others. Bring your own wine or beer is totally acceptable. Parking is a little tricky. They are faster at delivering the pizza than you would expect...probably only 10 min for pizza to come when it is one of their standard favorites with no odd requests."
,,,,,,,,,"By far the best pizza in ATL! As good as Italy! Service is fast too, even when the dining room is packed."
,,,,,,,,,Really really good pizza. Family style dining. Prob the best pizza I've had. This is the real deal. Don't wait in line twice like i did. Go past everyone waiting get your seats look at a menu then when you're ready to order go get in line. Oh yeah you can bring your own drinks in. Next time i'll bring some red wine to go with my meal. Try it out you will not regret it.
,,,,,,,,,"The parking here is very, very limited. The cashier wasn't really helpful. I don't speak Italian, thus didn't really understand the menu. Its first come, first serve seating, so you have to fend for yourself in finding a seat and no one cleaned off our table. The pizza is amazing though. It costs about $20 - 24. Water is $1.75 and soda and juices are $2.75. So, bring your wallet. The atmosphere is neat. The food tastes like all of the ingredients are fresh. We really enjoyed it. But my group of 11 had to split up for seating."
,,,,,,,,,Brought the family this time around... They loved it!!! Best pizza I have ever tasted... Please don't change a thing... #pizza #mustvisititaly
,,,,,,,,,Very unique pizza dining experience. If you like pizza this is a must-visit. Definitely very crowded and loud but that's a part of the appeal.
,,,,,,,,,"The food is great! Best pizza I've had in Atlanta for sure. The 4/5 rating is because the people at the registers are not friendly and rude. She didn't even say hello. Literally the only thing she said was the price... Each time I come, it's the same grumpy lady. Management should defiantly hire friendly people to speak to customers and take orders."
,,,,,,,,,"Let me say this, my husband love this place, as do all the other Georgia Tech Alums I know. 



I am not really a fan. The atmosphere is fun and the family style seating lets you meet lots of new people, but the pizza is just not for me. It tastes doughy and undercooked and feels really oily and soggy. 



It seems to be that you love it or hate it."
,,,,,,,,,"This is one of those places where you confidently bring your friends telling them this is the best pizza in Atlanta. I haven't had one person disagree. If they ever left Antico secretly longing in their hearts for Stevie B's, Little Caesars or Cicis, may they be judged and disciplined by higher powers at the appropriate juncture. 



There are strong preferences in the pizza world whether it be Chicago or NY style, but regardless of previous preference going in, once you try Antico you'll be won over. 



Welcome to Italian style. All ingredients are imported. The dough is charred yet chewy. The toppings are fresh. Dip the crust in some EVOO and crushed garlic as you wonder where this has been all your life. 



Made to order and thrown into a brick oven set to inferno churns out a perfect pizza in a very quick timeframe. You can accompany it with a bottle of wine if your bring it yourself. 



To conclude, stop by across the street for an espresso and some gelato to fill in whatever remaining crevasses exist in your insides."
,,,,,,,,,"Antico Pizza is the most authentic pizza i've ever had. Food is ordered at the counter and then you find your own seat at communal tables. Either you can sit in a smaller dining room or in the large dining area. The large dining area is in the kitchen area where you can see the chefs and cooks making the pizza right in front of you. They have air conditioners but it still gets pretty hot from the ovens. 



Pizzas come out really fast, like 5 to 10 minutes fast. Apparently, the ovens are so hot they flash cook the pies. The crusts are extremely crispy"
,,,,,,,,,"The reviews are true. The pizza is good and the dining area if u wanna call it that is somewhat odd. Community wood tables and stools... bar and table stools....so if crowded u will be eating with some of folks u don't know! 

The pizza is $20 bucks for the Margherita and $4 extra to add pepperoni. It's made in about 5min. I went on a Monday about 5pm and it wasn't crowded at all. 

Only had one problem, when I walked in the door I was completely ignored, the cashier lady was texting on her celly. I actually had to say something to her a couple of times to get her attention so I can place my order. All in all that wasn't a big deal and once I start eating I was ok! 



Parking is behind the building. 

This was my second time coming last time they ran out of dough on a weekend visit. 



Worth a try!"
,,,,,,,,,"Their website claims it to be the BEST EFFING PIZZA IN THE STATES. when i read that, i instantly thought, ""that's a helluva bold claim."" But they showed me what's up! By far the best pizza i've had outside of Italy. Doesn't matter which toppings, it's all in the dough. I'm from Chicago, but i would fly back to Atlanta just for this. If i had to pick one thing to eat for the rest of my life, it would be pizza. This, hands down, would be my choice in pizza. 



Now, if only, there's an Antico in Chicago. *hint hint* i hear Chicago is known for great food, so you'd fit right in. 



Brownie points for quick and efficient service! 



Warning: no bathroom? I think it was outside? Nothing like wondering around the entire restaurant in greasy pizza hands trying to find the toilet. Thought that was weird for a decent sized establishment. There is a sink to wash your hands though!"
,,,,,,,,,"This place is unlike any restaurant I've ever seen. You order once you walk in from one of their specialty pizzas. All pizzas come in one size and all the ingredients are flown in fresh and dough made fresh daily. The ovens heat up to 1200 degrees, so the pizzas cook in just around 90 seconds. You can bring your own alcohol and you can even eat in the kitchen! There are no plates or silverware, but they have plenty of napkins and little condiments everywhere. If you can, try the peppers in olive oil. You will love it! 



The pizza is some of the best you can get in midtown Atlanta, and it is a great place to go with a group of friends and enjoy a nice time!"
,,,,,,,,,The pizza is delicious best pizza in Atlanta. The service is super fast despite it being a little bit busy. It is four stars because one lady works there everyday and is rude. They also only have one bathroom.
,,,,,,,,,I can't believe I didn't rate this place until now. Best pizza in Atlanta. That's all there is too it. BYOB!! Social European style table environment. That's it. Nothing negative; unless they really do make the dough from crack.
,,,,,,,,,"Good pie in Napolitano style, excellent crust flavor, interesting topping selections"
,,,,,,,,,"On a road trip, based on reviews, stopped for lunch. It was an awesome authentic Italian experience all the way around."
,,,,,,,,,"I've lived in Atlanta for way long and I just had Antico for the first time on Thursday. 

And then again on Friday. 

And then again on Saturday... 

This is THE. BEST. PIZZA. EVER!!!! 

Seriously."
,,,,,,,,,"One of the best pizzas I've ever had!! Make sure you get here early if you want to guarantee you have a seat when they first open. My friend and I got here 15 minutes before they opened on a Friday and there was already a short line. Otherwise, you should wait until 12:30pm or so to avoid the initial rush, but it can be difficult to find seating. Most of the seating is communal style with large tables and benches, so you'll likely end up sitting next to strangers. 



There is only one size of pizza available, but different options for the toppings. You can also order calzones and they have cannolis or sfogliatelle for dessert options. We opted to try the highly recommended San Gennaro (Salsiccia, Sweet Red Pepper, Bufala, Cipolline, $22, yelp.com/user_local_phot… ), which was delicious!! The crust was SO good, with a crispy exterior but soft and chewy interior. It was airy and fluffy, and didn't sink to the bottom of your stomach like a leaden weight after eating it. The topping combination was also perfect, and the tomato sauce nicely flavorful. We were able to finish this pizza as two girls, since it was difficult to stop eating although we were definitely full at the end. We also loved the Sides for the pizza: Parmesan Cheese, Marinated Peppers, Red Pepper Flakes, Chili Paste ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ), especially the marinated peppers and red pepper flakes. 



I would definitely come back here for more pizza if I'm back in the Atlanta area- I can see why they've been profiled for Food Network!! Parking can be difficult since they don't really have a lot and street parking is limited."
,,,,,,,,,"I had two slices, the Margarita and the Lasagna pizza. Both of them were amazing. The Pizzas are that perfect New York style and still manage to load up the toppings (something that's low-key hard to find in a New York Style pizza joint). 



I had them hot, saved some later for when they were cold, it was still out of this world. 



Recommend honestly any kind of pizza from this place, phenomenal."
,,,,,,,,,Tried almost every type of pizza here. Love this place for the quick service and fresh ingredients they use.
,,,,,,,,,"I don't do lines. And I don't do the whole scavenger hunt for a seat thing. At Antico you have to do both. 



It was V-day and my mommy was in town and wanted to try their pizza, so I endured both. It really was a drag having to desperately scan the room for seats, but thankfully we found a place for our party of three. 



The pizza was good. We had the San Genaro, but I can promise you I won't be back until they add a hostess stand and designated seating for a more civilized dining experience."
,,,,,,,,,"Been here a few times and the experience has been pretty consistent: 

- Surley and unfriendly front counter staff that treats you like an inconvenience 

- Overpriced & limited beverage selection 

- Difficult parking situation 

- Excellent, excellent pizza (a bit chintzy with the toppings by American standards but not by Italian standards) 

- Very quick service! You can get a terrific pizza here about as quickly as you can have a fast food meal once you park. 



My 3-star rating is because the smarmy front counter staff diminishes the experience. I don't want to drop $20-$30 on a meal and be treated like I'm a bother by the cashier. I'd give the food a solid 4.5 to 5 stars. 



Last time I was there I tried their gelato place across the street afterward. It was great and actually had friendly staff working there!"
,,,,,,,,,I prefer a crunch in crust. Floppy making it hard to handle. Margarita pizza only had two big leaves of basil with chewy stem. Delicious sparkling Prickly pair and orange drink.
,,,,,,,,,"I really love their pizza. Definitely one of the best of its kind. 



The reason for 4 stars versus 5 is the inability to get something that doesn't set you back at least $30. There is only one size, and it is rather large so you need to share it with one or two other people. It makes it quite an expensive pizza lunch. 



That said, it is worth it in my opinion. I would just love to be able to go by myself for lunch since I work about a block away."
,,,,,,,,,"Wow. Definitely not going to return to this location again. Something needs to be done about the rude staff-- specifically the cashiers. Everyone else was nice. Puts a sour taste in your mouth when you go to an establishment for the great pizza and end up having your initial encounter with the place involve some miserable, angry employee who is supposed to provide hospitality and service, and instead leaves you wanting to slap her mama for the lack of etiquette and manners. 



Normally, food outweighs service for me but this is the second visit in a row where the cashier was unbelievably rude. A couple friends and I were in line and we made separate orders. Upon completing my order, my friend stepped up to go next. The girl looks at him and rudely tells him he has to get back in line (mind you, the line was out the door at this point). Uh WHY? She goes ""because you can't order again."" Uh, I'm sorry, ""again??"" These are two separate orders for two different tabs from two separate people, both of whom were waiting patiently in line. She had an attitude during the entire encounter and was so extremely rude-- all it takes to do your job is count the correct change and smile and she couldn't do it right. I don't even care if she wasn't friendly.. But downright RUDE? No. You're in the service industry lady. Get it together. 



Definitely won't be coming back here. Hopefully their Avalon location is better so if I really want their pizza again, maybe I will give that location a try. This terrible encounter makes me not want to ever go back because I don't want to support an establishment with such a low level of hospitality and service. This is my second critical review of their service and I hope they rectify this soon. If I could give negative stars, I would. Such a shame because the food is great."
,,,,,,,,,"Pizza was amazing, served up super-quick. Communal dining meant a short wait for seating on a Friday night but fellow patrons made room. Very enjoyable experience!"
14944415,4,5,10,10,10,10,9,10,"Definitively solid pizza, however, the hype is a little overblown. I would suggest car pooling if you come because parking is limited and people turn into novice drivers in that area if things get tight."
,,,,,,,,,"I don't know if I had Antico on an off day, but it did not live up to all of the hype. The crust, sauce, cheese and toppings were all just average to me. I left very disappointed after everything that I had heard about Antico."
,,,,,,,,,"Stopped by on a Monday after lunch rush to try out this spot for the first time. Ordered the San Gennaro pizza and it was delicious. Pizza was very fresh, service was quick, and place had a nice family style atmosphere. 



Quality of ingredients was a bit better than your average pizza spot, so I expected the price range of pizzas. I usually don't eat pizza crust, but this crust was very flavorful so I couldn't resist. 



Would definitely stop by again the next time I visit the Atlanta area."
,,,,,,,,,"Had a great time here yesterday with friends from out of town. This pizza is some of the best I've tried and certainly better than in Italy (I haven't been to Napoli so clearly I missed out because these people know what they're doing). We brought two bottles of wine and they kindly provided us a cork screw. The girls in the front weren't the most pleasant of species but I'm not deterred nor give a damn about them. 



We ordered the lasagna and the pomodorini pizzas and both were superb, but definitely liked the lasagna better. Next time I'm having the spicy ones! Full meal for less than $50 with wine! Can't beat it."
11786145,20,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great tasting Pizza. 



Crust is cooked not burnt but slightly charred. 

The cheese, I love the smell of the cheese right before I take a bite. 

Toppings are hearty. 



Pricey for a pizza, but it is hella better than california pizza in my opinion."
,,,,,,,,,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This pizza is absolutely amazing. Yes, it's a little pricey, but honestly for the quality of ingreedients I think it's more than fair. Plus, any cheaper and the lines would just be even longer than they already are. 



I've never had an issue with parking (in their lot or on the street) or finding a seat exactly where I wanted to be. I love getting here every chance that I get. 



Tips: It's BYOB so don't forget to bring along your favorite wine or beer. I would try to get here as close to opening as possible as it can get very crowded and they stop baking when the dough runs out. I tend to come at about noon on Saturday."
,,,,,,,,,"Oh so good pizza! 



Delicious, authentic, informal atmosphere, community tables, roll of brown paper towels for napkins, delivered on large cookie sheet. All of this makes for a great experience for a group of diners. 



And did I mention the taste is 'Oh so good!' 



Must go there!"
,,,,,,,,,"The best gourmet pizza in Atlanta by far! IMO. You can't go wrong with St Genaro and Margherita. 



It's usually packed during weekends so if you don't like it too crowded come on a weekday. 



It's BYOB but if you weren't able to bring your own, they have some available for purchase. It's communal seating too which frankly, I'm not a very big fan of but I come for the pizza anyway!"
,,,,,,,,,"Good, but did not live up to the hype. We have been to pizza heaven (Pepe's, Sally's, and Bar) in New Haven, CT and have not been able to find anything close. Pizza at Antico simply too doughy, and not interesting enough."
,,,,,,,,,"Pizza is delicious. Pizza is fantastic when it's from Antico. The dining is very open and communal. Once we ordered our pizzas the search for a table was on. It reminded me of the college dining hall days where you search for that group of people who is almost done eating and you wanna play it cool that you want their table without forcing them to leave. 



This is the 1st place I've been to or heard of a restaurant having BYOB. BYOB people! Paying a little extra for the fresh ingredients is worth it because #1 the flavor is amazing. And #2 byob brings some savings. 



A great pizza option is margarita and add sausage. The place is very open and great atmosphere. You can see the pizzas being made to help you drool while you wait. 



Overall, bring your own drinks, be patient with getting a table and enjoy the delicious pizza."
,,,,,,,,,"I adore this pizza. Closest to what I am used to from my growing up days in Boston and my visits to Italy. Wish they weren't so particular about what toppings you can have as far as substitutions. I know they're saying it's being authentic but that does not jibe with my visits to Italy and Naples in general. Still the quality of the ingredients, the flavors, and the atmosphere cannot be beat in Atlanta. I love all those chard bubbles on the crust!!"
,,,,,,,,,"Pizza is really good...actually, it's great. 



Only complaint, but a big one for me, is that a tiny 8 ounce bottle of Coke/Diet Coke is $3. That's equivalent to $4.50 for a regular 12 ounce can or $7.50 for a regular size 20 ounce bottle. I can usually consume a 20 ounce bottle with my meal but I really cannot justify paying $6-7 for a normal soft drink serving. 



I know the restaurant is extremely successful (and I eat here on a semi-regular basis) but I would personally eat there more frequently if my 16 ounces of Diet Coke didn't cost $6."
,,,,,,,,,Amazingggggg. Had this place a few weeks ago. Their Caesar salad has anchovies and was the best Caesar I've had ever. The arugula salad was super good too! Great prices for what you get it as well.
,,,,,,,,,"This pizza was some of the best I've ever had, and I've eaten in places from NYC to Italy. Just overall fantastic. 



Loved the paper towel plates too"
,,,,,,,,,Prime example of a restaurant living off of past rating. Staff is completely rude. There are better gourmet pizza parlors in the city sans overly entitled staff and mangers. Won't get my business again.
,,,,,,,,,"One of very few BOY wine restaurants in Atlanta. It's a small Italian restaurant with delicious pizza. The only downfall is the space. It leads to a communal environment; however, it's very hard to get a table. It's first come, first serve - fight for your own."
,,,,,,,,,"Although the pizza is worthy of 6 stars (not just 5), I can't come up with any valid reason why Antico won't allow a customer to leave an ingredient off the pizza. I understand the ""no substitutions"" rule (speed of service, etc), but I know I'm not the only person in Atlanta with a severe allergy or other severe aversion to certain ingredients. Antico's policy basically tells me (and those people with similar issues as me) to go f*ck myself if that one ingredient is on a pizza I otherwise want to order. 



Each pizza is made to order & the guy is making the pizza 3 feet from where I ordered it. Please explain why it's impossible to leave off the onions or the mushrooms or whatever. It would take less time if the pizza maker left that ingredient off!! Seriously, I don't get it. Giovanni, you're not that special. 



So, I love their pizza but their policies make zero sense to me. Which would explain why I've eaten here just twice even though I live within walking distance. I know they're raking in the dough so they don't need my business, but I can't possibly rate them higher when I know my dining experience wasn't as amazing as it easily could (should?) have been. Unless they change their rules, I won't be back. 



PS - learn the English language. ""No substitutions"" doesn't accurately convey your policy. Asking to ""hold the onions"" isn't a substitution request by any meaning of the word. Your dumb policy should say ""No modifications."" Until next time, I'll be at any number of their competitors: Varasano's, Double Zero, etc."
,,,,,,,,,Very savory original Italian pie. Very fresh ingredients that create a wonderful experience!!
,,,,,,,,,"If I'm paying $21 for a pizza, I wouldn't expect to get a pizza that skimps on ingredients. I ordered the Margherita pizza, which only had five or six basil leaves. While the pizza was good, it definitely would have been better with more basil. Most of my slices were just cheese and tomato sauce. Minus one star for that. Additionally, the woman working behind the counter was less than pleasant, which is another reason why I docked a star."
,,,,,,,,,"Such a cool place! You order a pizza and then sit down at picnic tables where they'll bring it out to you. You're allowed to bring whatever drinks you want which makes for a great time! The pizza comes out fairly quickly too, which is awesome."
,,,,,,,,,"Bit pricy for pizza but the wood fire brick touch is a game changer. Melt in your mouth pizza, thin crust: what more could you ask for! We arrived ten minutes before opening and there was already a decent line- testament to how good this place is. Don't worry though, the line moves quickly! I'm not much of a pizza person but this place really satisfied me and my friends!"
,,,,,,,,,"Went for my first time today and was greeted by a woman who didn't seem to really care to take our order. After telling her what we wanted three times she finally rang us up and decided to take a personal call and then tell us our total, the whole situation really bummed me out and was in a bad mood the rest of the time there. It's hard to enjoy great food in an atmosphere that almost feels unwelcoming!"
,,,,,,,,,"Pizza is pretty good, I've gotten burnt pizza a few times as well as still raw dough when they are really busy and rushing. Definitely get it to go because the seating is horrendous and lines are crazy! 

The pizza is good, don't get me wrong, but there are quite a few places in Atlanta where you can get good pizza if you don't want to deal with crazy crowds and the possibility of no seats."
,,,,,,,,,"Absolutely delicious Pizza! Some of the best in Hotlanta! You order when you come in and the menu is a bit confusing, but if you can get over that, the pizza is delicious."
,,,,,,,,,"Okay, first of all, don't tell anyone, but I love pizza... Yes, I do. I had my fair share of pies of Chicago, Californian and lots of New Yorker pies and even Argentinian pies too. Thin-crusts, deep crusts, circles, squares, rectangles, etc... 



I have read the countless reviews here and figured with all the talk, this place has to be the best place in Atlanta to get pizza. It has to be, right? With an average of 4.5 stars with 1,710 reviews, it is a requirement. 



Last time I stopped here, the place closed about 3 hours early, because they ran out of dough. After a long day, what else can a person want after a couple of 5K's? Margherita pizza! 



So I stopped here, the place was packed and I ordered myself the Margherita pizza made with fresh mozzarella di bufala Campana and San Marzano tomatoes. To be honest, the prices look deceiving at first glimpse, one probably first notices the prices, then realizes they are in € Euros, not $ dollars, until they look at the left of the sign. With tax, the Margherita cost roughly $22 and it definitely is enough to eat, yet, for a pizza this size and for the price, three or four leafs of basil I feel is completely absurd. 



The one thing that totally sucks about this place is that you have to order an ENTIRE pizza, They do not sell by the slice. 



The pizza was decent, but did nothing for my palate as a pie from Chicago or New York could. Maybe it is my fault, I'll have to come back and give Antico Pizza another try. Next time I'll order the Pizza Capricciosa and hopefully I will reach a state of euphoria. 



[Review #226]"
,,,,,,,,,"Great pizza, food was quick, unique flavor combinations, cute female staff. Paid a little more than I would like to pay for a pie but I understand since they import ingredients from Italy."
,,,,,,,,,"Seriously the best pizza I've ever eaten! Antico is a quaint little place with so much charm. Each time I come, I get the San Gennaro pizza which is simply amazing. It has Italian sausage,fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, onions and sweet peppers. Antico can get crowded pretty fast, so go early and avoid the crowds!"
,,,,,,,,,"The best pizza in the most authentic Italian atmosphere. Sit outside on a beautiful day, and enjoy pizza, Gio's Chicken and wine!"
,,,,,,,,,On our way to Atlanta we decided to stop here for dinner. We decided on the white pizza and the margarita. This pizza place uses the freshest ingredients in their food. You can watch them cook your food right in front of you. Definitely coming back here next time I visit.
,,,,,,,,,"Antico Pizza Napoletana gets the full 5 stars after our group dropped by for a quick tomato pie...or two...or three. 



Antico Pizza came with the highest recommendation of a couple of local Yelpers and it definitely ""panned"" out for us. 



After placing our order for a Pomodorini (with fresh cherry tomatoes) and a pair of Margheritas (with san marzano tomatoes) with pepperoni, we ventured back to the wood-fired ovens and watched in amazement as the tomato pies were moved in and out of the ovens with skilled coordination. 



Our pies arrived at our table in short order drapped across two aluminum sheet trays lined with wax paper. The wax paper harkened me back to the days when I enjoyed ""apizza"" at Pepe's on Wooster Street in New Haven. 



The pizza at Antico was everything we hoped for with just the right amount of 'burn"" around the crust and an authentic garlicy tomato sauce. Top shelf."
,,,,,,,,,"The pizza was delicious, the people are extremely welcoming. The atmosphere is good for all ages, and the setup is very neat. They bring out the pizza straight from the oven. Clearly the Italian chefs know what their doing."
,,,,,,,,,"Got the margarita pizza with Italian sausage. It was probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The dough is what impressed me the most - soft, chewy, and smokey..."
,,,,,,,,,"Love Antico the concept. Pizzas and little Italy are are top notch. Their pizza is one of my favorite in atlanta. The outdoor seating and BYO drinks is really cool. 

Best items: 

-Classic margarita pizza. (It's the original first ever pizza) 

- peach ice tea 



One thing I wish Antico did. Was allow you to build your own pizza"
,,,,,,,,,"Coming from New York I am a harsh judge of pizza. I expect certain things and if they aren't delivered I am quickly disappointed. Here's what Antico has going for it: really excellent flavors and ingredients that taste fresh; a bumping atmosphere that has a charm all its own; a limited menu that allows them to focus on just a few particular pizzas and perfect them; and finally a buttery, chewy crust that is truly the best ending to the slice. 



Here's where they missed the mark: no crispy bottomed pizza, which means that the slice droops sadly when you lift it making it near impossible to fold and eat the Neapolitan way (as they have written on the wall above their restrooms). 



However, the experience is awesome for a literal no frills place. No plates, just paper towels and big trays of pizza with a bustling crew that cranks out pies at an alarming speed. It's a fun spot for a quick bite and a decent pie, floppy slices and all."
,,,,,,,,,"If pizza is supposed to 85% dough with little to no toppings, then Antico makes pizza. Otherwise their 'pizza' is unacceptable for its price. 



I have visited Antico twice, and upon both occasions I have met with disappointment. Due to their policy of 'no customizations', every pizza option presented to me had an ingredient on it that I dislike. Still, I got over it and ordered the option I was most likely to enjoy. As I waited for my pizza, I began looking forward to an exciting experience of a crispy and delicious meat covered monster of a pizza. Lo and behold, somehow the pizza presented to me was somehow both soggy and burnt at the same time. Each bite taken tasted terribly bitter from the overly charred bottom. Each limp slice had the thinnest layer of cheese imaginable, and barely any more meat than cheese. Both of my visits ended up similarly enough to where I would not recommend going back. 



Even if the pizza was as cheap as Papa John's, I would still choose Papa John's."
,,,,,,,,,Pizza was delicious! The vibe of the place is super cool and you can watch the chefs cooking as you eat your meal. The only thing is both myself and the person I ate with had stomach aches after. Maybe had trouble digesting that dough and real cheese.
