Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico)

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? 



If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted.

For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted.

This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?



If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted.



Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted.

We came on a Saturday around 11:30. They do not open until noon, so we had to wait in line outside. They brought out a sample pizza for all of us in line to have, which I greatly appreciated. It was so delicious it made me want to beat down the door even more.



Once we were inside we quickly found a seat because there is little seating inside. It is great to sit at communal tables with loud, instrumental music blaring while the employees are tossing pizza dough into the air.



We had the mushroom truffle pizza that was on special. It was close to $30, but holy hell it was worth every penny. You definitely got the truffle taste. Everything was so fresh. I often feel skimped on the truffle, not this time.



I also love the fresh Parmesan, peppers, and other ingredients they leave out for you to dress every pizza bite with.



Probably the best pizza I've ever had.",3/24/2011 14:51,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181

They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max.

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves.



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance!



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens.



Please visit this place at least once, you won't regret it!",3/7/2011 7:36,0,1,2,3,5,4,10/15/2009,5,1,27,1,NA,610
