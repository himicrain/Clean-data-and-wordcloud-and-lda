Traditional Neapolitan style pizza, and apparently the ingredients are actually flown in from Italy, as well as the pizza ovens themselves. The space is open and you can see the kitchen at work from the main dining area. There's a spot to grab toppings (think sea salt, garlic, parmesan and crushed red peppers) and olive oil for dipping in the kitchen area. 



We had the Margherita D.O.P and the Diavalo. The salami and peppers are a perfect combo on the Diavalo, and just the right amount of spicy. Fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes on both, which obviously. I also grabbed a Limonata to complete the experience and think back to my recent afternoon Italian escapades.

Not much more to say. I have eaten pizza all over the US and Europe, Italy included. Antico's is just that great. You order at the counter and proceed to find a seat. They have two sides to their menu, Rosso or Bianche pizza (think red / white). The pizzas are designed to be ordered as is, no substitutions, and frankly you wouldn't want to. The San Gennaro is probably the favorite. The ingredients translate to sausage, sweet peppers, cheese, and onions. Also tried and true deliciousness: lasagna pizza and Margherita with pepperoni. Flavors are just right. 



Now besides the amazing cheeses and fresh ingredients, the dough is the star. The pizzas are cooked in their pizza oven giving the dough the perfect doughy, soft, charred and textured consistency- its heaven on earth. I literally eat at least 4 slices. 



Now seating is community style and basically in the kitchen. Gives the place a totally different feel. You can grab fresh garlic, cheese, red pepper flakes or oil and bring to your table. Also, you can BYOB (awesowe!)

Pizza was average, nothing special, had that burned taste, we wanted to try margarita pizza with sausage or prosciutto, but they said that they can not mix two flavors, we have to buy two pizzas... I mean how hard it is to sprinkle prosciutto on one side of pizza.. girls who were working over there was very rude, was talking with each other in front of customers, we felt so welcomed.

Not much more to say. I have eaten pizza all over the US and Europe, Italy included. Antico's is just that great. You order at the counter and proceed to find a seat. They have two sides to their menu, Rosso or Bianche pizza (think red / white). The pizzas are designed to be ordered as is, no substitutions, and frankly you wouldn't want to. The San Gennaro is probably the favorite. The ingredients translate to sausage, sweet peppers, cheese, and onions. Also tried and true deliciousness: lasagna pizza and Margherita with pepperoni. Flavors are just right.



Now besides the amazing cheeses and fresh ingredients, the dough is the star. The pizzas are cooked in their pizza oven giving the dough the perfect doughy, soft, charred and textured consistency- its heaven on earth. I literally eat at least 4 slices.



Now seating is community style and basically in the kitchen. Gives the place a totally different feel. You can grab fresh garlic, cheese, red pepper flakes or oil and bring to your table. Also, you can BYOB (awesowe!)



This place is a must try for everyone. Just go!",11/12/2009 0:17,0,1,2,3,5,5,2/22/2010,5,0,24,1,2,448

Traditional Neapolitan style pizza, and apparently the ingredients are actually flown in from Italy, as well as the pizza ovens themselves. The space is open and you can see the kitchen at work from the main dining area. There's a spot to grab toppings (think sea salt, garlic, parmesan and crushed red peppers) and olive oil for dipping in the kitchen area.



We had the Margherita D.O.P and the Diavalo. The salami and peppers are a perfect combo on the Diavalo, and just the right amount of spicy. Fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes on both, which obviously. I also grabbed a Limonata to complete the experience and think back to my recent afternoon Italian escapades.
