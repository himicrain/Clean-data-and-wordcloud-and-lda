When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. 



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes. 



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time. 



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine.

Environment: So fast! Moments after sitting down you'll have your pizza. Order to-go or take a seat. There's extra seating in the back. Also hidden in the back by the kitchen you'll find fresh garlic, Parmesan, crushed red pepper, etc. They have drinks but you can also BYOB.

Now onto the food, you really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas but my favorite is the classic margherita. I usually like to add some extra toppings such as pepperoni or sausage, but it's delicious just by itself too! All of their pizzas are pretty simple (not too many crazy toppings), but they are all so savory (again... it's the sauce!) that you really don't need the extra toppings!



Parking: very limited parking/street parking so I'd recommend ubering, esp if you're planning on BYOB-ing ;)

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes.



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time.



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad.

We ordered the truffle mushroom pizza for $27, which is only being offered for a limited time. It was really delicious. The flavor and aroma of truffle and mushrooms was almost too much to handle! Every bite was so good. You just want to keep eating more. Before you know it, the whole pizza has been devoured!

Now onto the food, you really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas but my favorite is the classic margherita.

All of their pizzas are pretty simple (not too many crazy toppings), but they are all so savory (again... it's the sauce!) that you really don't need the extra toppings!



Parking: very limited parking/street parking so I'd recommend ubering, esp if you're planning on BYOB-ing ;)

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes.



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time.



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad.

Parking: very limited parking/street parking so I'd recommend ubering, esp if you're planning on BYOB-ing ;)

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes.



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time.



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine.
