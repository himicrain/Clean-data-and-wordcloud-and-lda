The verdura pizza is what called our names. It came out fairly fast, with all kinds of great add ons. I can't talk about the food until I talk about the atmosphere though. 



You walk in and order at a counter. It's hot and loud and somehow extremely endearing. There are about 8-10 pizza options, all Neapolitan style. This place is very cafeteria style and is BYOB, so grab your wine. Glasses are on the table. 



Alright back to food. The pizza comes out on a big baking sheet, fresh out of the over. The Verdura comes with broccoli rabe for a nice green, shrooms for a nice meaty flavor, cherry tomatoes for that umami pop we all love, and buffalo moz to hold it all together. 



My gosh y'all this was the best pizza I've ever had. It was so familiar yet so complex tasting, unlike any pizza I've ever had. For the price, it's unbeatable. Please come and eat til you can't eat any longer.",5/19/2010 3:13,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181
013e43ae20d2d1dc599f1e7f7fd9f768,2293607,"Best pizza I have ever had, period. We got the lasagna pizza, the spinach/brocolli pizza, and a pepperoni with peppers pizza (I don't remember the actual unique names they give them). They all were absolutely delicious, the pizza is of true Italian origin. Light sauce, cheese is spread out not just thrown all over the pizza, same goes for the other toppings. Crust was amazing, it's baked in a wood oven so the slight smoked charcoal taste on the crust was absolutely amazing. 



The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy. 



Price, this is where I take off one star. It is expensive!!! The pizza is really good like I said, but does $24+ a pizza warrant that, i'm not so sure it does. The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think they throw $20+ worth of it on the pizza. 



Would I go back? Yes, but only if it's a work outing and the company is paying, cause if you get two pizzas you're looking at $50! Ah! The pizza is absolutely delicious though, if you haven't been, go and splurge at least one here.",1/18/2010 16:44,0,1,2,3,4,3,6/13/2010,5,0,30,1,2,86

The verdura pizza is what called our names. It came out fairly fast, with all kinds of great add ons. I can't talk about the food until I talk about the atmosphere though.



You walk in and order at a counter. It's hot and loud and somehow extremely endearing. There are about 8-10 pizza options, all Neapolitan style. This place is very cafeteria style and is BYOB, so grab your wine. Glasses are on the table.



Alright back to food. The pizza comes out on a big baking sheet, fresh out of the over. The Verdura comes with broccoli rabe for a nice green, shrooms for a nice meaty flavor, cherry tomatoes for that umami pop we all love, and buffalo moz to hold it all together.

We got the lasagna pizza, the spinach/brocolli pizza, and a pepperoni with peppers pizza (I don't remember the actual unique names they give them). They all were absolutely delicious, the pizza is of true Italian origin. Light sauce, cheese is spread out not just thrown all over the pizza, same goes for the other toppings. Crust was amazing, it's baked in a wood oven so the slight smoked charcoal taste on the crust was absolutely amazing.



The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy.



Price, this is where I take off one star. It is expensive!!! The pizza is really good like I said, but does $24+ a pizza warrant that, i'm not so sure it does. The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think they throw $20+ worth of it on the pizza.

You walk in and order at a counter. It's hot and loud and somehow extremely endearing. There are about 8-10 pizza options, all Neapolitan style. This place is very cafeteria style and is BYOB, so grab your wine. Glasses are on the table.



Alright back to food. The pizza comes out on a big baking sheet, fresh out of the over. The Verdura comes with broccoli rabe for a nice green, shrooms for a nice meaty flavor, cherry tomatoes for that umami pop we all love, and buffalo moz to hold it all together.



My gosh y'all this was the best pizza I've ever had. It was so familiar yet so complex tasting, unlike any pizza I've ever had. For the price, it's unbeatable. Please come and eat til you can't eat any longer.",5/19/2010 3:13,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181
013e43ae20d2d1dc599f1e7f7fd9f768,2293607,"Best pizza I have ever had, period. We got the lasagna pizza, the spinach/brocolli pizza, and a pepperoni with peppers pizza (I don't remember the actual unique names they give them). They all were absolutely delicious, the pizza is of true Italian origin. Light sauce, cheese is spread out not just thrown all over the pizza, same goes for the other toppings. Crust was amazing, it's baked in a wood oven so the slight smoked charcoal taste on the crust was absolutely amazing.



The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy.



Price, this is where I take off one star. It is expensive!!! The pizza is really good like I said, but does $24+ a pizza warrant that, i'm not so sure it does. The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think they throw $20+ worth of it on the pizza.



Would I go back? Yes, but only if it's a work outing and the company is paying, cause if you get two pizzas you're looking at $50! Ah! The pizza is absolutely delicious though, if you haven't been, go and splurge at least one here.",1/18/2010 16:44,0,1,2,3,4,3,6/13/2010,5,0,30,1,2,86

We sat across the street at the cafe and the pizza was out in a flash it seemed! Atmosphere was fun and the patio was busy. I enjoyed the Margherita pizza but the Sophia was not my favorite. $27 for a pizza seems like a lot too.



After pizza, I ordered gelato- Peanut Butter Cup. It was smooth and creamy, very good! Also ordered Caramel Cheesecake. The cheesecake was very dense and rich, only a few bites and we were done.



We were a party of 4 and took home half a pizza and the cheesecake.",3/27/2010 16:36,0,1,2,3,6,2,6/2/2010,5,0,42,NA,2,39

You get this vibe that makes you feel like you're in a scene waiting for Julia Roberts to appear to hand you your pie. My and my friend use to eat here all the time before she moved & it brings back great memories. My favorite pizza to order is the Diavola. The flavors that hit your mouth as you bite into that meaty pie are unreal and I feel like if you could bite into Italy, that's what it would taste like!

The calzones are HUGE!!!. Pizza's are also HUGE, but the thin crust makes it not too fulling. I usually can only eat 1-2 slices of pizza from papa johns, but I easily put down 3-4 slices here.
