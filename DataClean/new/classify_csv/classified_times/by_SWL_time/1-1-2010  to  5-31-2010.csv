Not much more to say. I have eaten pizza all over the US and Europe, Italy included. Antico's is just that great. You order at the counter and proceed to find a seat. They have two sides to their menu, Rosso or Bianche pizza (think red / white). The pizzas are designed to be ordered as is, no substitutions, and frankly you wouldn't want to. The San Gennaro is probably the favorite. The ingredients translate to sausage, sweet peppers, cheese, and onions. Also tried and true deliciousness: lasagna pizza and Margherita with pepperoni. Flavors are just right. 



Now besides the amazing cheeses and fresh ingredients, the dough is the star. The pizzas are cooked in their pizza oven giving the dough the perfect doughy, soft, charred and textured consistency- its heaven on earth. I literally eat at least 4 slices. 



Now seating is community style and basically in the kitchen. Gives the place a totally different feel. You can grab fresh garlic, cheese, red pepper flakes or oil and bring to your table. Also, you can BYOB (awesowe!)

There's something about the sauce they use that makes their pizzas extra delicious and special, not to mention they make their pizzas fresh & you can really taste it in the dough (YUM). You order at the counter then seat yourself; it's pretty much always packed but it doesn't take long to find a spot. The best part about this place is that it's BYOB, so grab a bottle of wine/pack of beer & some buddies and head on over!!



Now onto the food, you really can't go wrong with any of their pizzas but my favorite is the classic margherita. I usually like to add some extra toppings such as pepperoni or sausage, but it's delicious just by itself too! All of their pizzas are pretty simple (not too many crazy toppings), but they are all so savory (again... it's the sauce!) that you really don't need the extra toppings!



Parking: very limited parking/street parking so I'd recommend ubering, esp if you're planning on BYOB-ing ;)



Price: Around $20ish for a whole pizza so some may think it's a bit pricey but trust me when I say it's absolutely worth the deliciousness!!!",10/13/2010 3:59,0,1,2,3,6,1,4/21/2010,5,1,21,5,1,76
