Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? 



If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted. 



Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? 



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted.

This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted.

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?



If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted.



Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted.

This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted.

If you've been to DeSano Pizza at any of their locations nationwide Antico will look familiar, with its counter ordering and backroom that offers a clear view of the cooks and ovens. It's a great setup, and the service was fast and friendly. Star Granted.



Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?



For $22.00, my coworker and I got a full Diavola pizza, which turned out to be more than enough to cover a dinner for two. That obviously maths out to $11.00 per person, which was more than reasonable for a great pizza dinner. Star Granted.



Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?



This was truly excellent pizza, with thick and flavorful crust, cheese than maintained its shape bite after bite, and a great combination of toppings in the form of pepperonis and flavorful spicy peppers. Game. Set. Match. Dual Stars Granted.



Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?



This is a close one, but I ever so slightly prefer DeSano Pizza to Antico, and Antico falls just short of my top spot Tony's in San Francisco. No Star Granted.",3/12/2011 22:39,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181

The verdura pizza is what called our names. It came out fairly fast, with all kinds of great add ons. I can't talk about the food until I talk about the atmosphere though.



You walk in and order at a counter. It's hot and loud and somehow extremely endearing. There are about 8-10 pizza options, all Neapolitan style. This place is very cafeteria style and is BYOB, so grab your wine. Glasses are on the table.



Alright back to food. The pizza comes out on a big baking sheet, fresh out of the over. The Verdura comes with broccoli rabe for a nice green, shrooms for a nice meaty flavor, cherry tomatoes for that umami pop we all love, and buffalo moz to hold it all together.



My gosh y'all this was the best pizza I've ever had. It was so familiar yet so complex tasting, unlike any pizza I've ever had. For the price, it's unbeatable. Please come and eat til you can't eat any longer.",5/19/2010 3:13,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181

Pizza was average, nothing special, had that burned taste, we wanted to try margarita pizza with sausage or prosciutto, but they said that they can not mix two flavors, we have to buy two pizzas... I mean how hard it is to sprinkle prosciutto on one side of pizza.. girls who were working over there was very rude, was talking with each other in front of customers, we felt so welcomed. It's sad that we expected so much but left disappointed. Sorry..",11/28/2009 8:50,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181

We came on a Saturday around 11:30. They do not open until noon, so we had to wait in line outside. They brought out a sample pizza for all of us in line to have, which I greatly appreciated. It was so delicious it made me want to beat down the door even more.



Once we were inside we quickly found a seat because there is little seating inside. It is great to sit at communal tables with loud, instrumental music blaring while the employees are tossing pizza dough into the air.



We had the mushroom truffle pizza that was on special. It was close to $30, but holy hell it was worth every penny. You definitely got the truffle taste. Everything was so fresh. I often feel skimped on the truffle, not this time.



I also love the fresh Parmesan, peppers, and other ingredients they leave out for you to dress every pizza bite with.



Probably the best pizza I've ever had.",3/24/2011 14:51,0,1,2,3,3,1,10/14/2011,5,1,25,2,NA,181
