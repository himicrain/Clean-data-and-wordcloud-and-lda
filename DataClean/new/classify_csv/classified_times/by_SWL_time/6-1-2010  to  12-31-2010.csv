It's my family's favorite pizza restaurant to eat at and we come here every time my brother and I are back in town. I've had the Margherita and the Sophia and they are both delicious. I judge a pizza place by their Margherita because it's a simple pizza that should be done right and Antico did a great job with the Margherita. The Sophia, which is bufala, cipollini onions, roasted mushrooms, and white truffle oil, has a ton of flavor and is a great pizza for vegetarians.

We got the lasagna pizza, the spinach/brocolli pizza, and a pepperoni with peppers pizza (I don't remember the actual unique names they give them). They all were absolutely delicious, the pizza is of true Italian origin. Light sauce, cheese is spread out not just thrown all over the pizza, same goes for the other toppings. Crust was amazing, it's baked in a wood oven so the slight smoked charcoal taste on the crust was absolutely amazing. 



The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy. 



Price, this is where I take off one star. It is expensive!!! The pizza is really good like I said, but does $24+ a pizza warrant that, i'm not so sure it does. The ingredients are fresh, but I don't think they throw $20+ worth of it on the pizza. 



Would I go back? Yes, but only if it's a work outing and the company is paying, cause if you get two pizzas you're looking at $50! Ah! The pizza is absolutely delicious though, if you haven't been, go and splurge at least one here.",1/18/2010 16:44,0,1,2,3,4,3,6/13/2010,5,0,30,1,2,86

Although they offer various different pizzas, I only order Margheriat D.O.P. As the famous saying goes, less is more. If you can handle spice, I would recommend Diavola; the addition of soppressata and peperonata packs a punch and flavor.



In my experience, it is absolutely the best to eat their pizza right out of the oven, piping hot. So I would recommend dining in, rather than doing a take-out.

Many years have gone by, and I still remember this place fondly. Upon my most recent visit, I learned that 1) most of their pizza costs over $20, 2) they have expanded their dining area by opening up the kitchen, and 3) they don't have dry oregano sprigs and peperonata on the table for you to garnish your pizza with anymore.

The quality of the ingredients is superb: the sauce made using the San Marzano tomatoes is pleasantly acidic, the crust is perfectly charred, and the bufala mozzarella is creamy. If this doesn't make you salivate, I don't know what will.



Although they offer various different pizzas, I only order Margheriat D.O.P. As the famous saying goes, less is more. If you can handle spice, I would recommend Diavola; the addition of soppressata and peperonata packs a punch and flavor.



In my experience, it is absolutely the best to eat their pizza right out of the oven, piping hot. So I would recommend dining in, rather than doing a take-out.

The Sophia, which is bufala, cipollini onions, roasted mushrooms, and white truffle oil, has a ton of flavor and is a great pizza for vegetarians.

The atmosphere is great, it definitely has the small pizzeria feel too it. It can get busy and you might end up without a place to sit, the place is small so it can get loud when it's busy.
