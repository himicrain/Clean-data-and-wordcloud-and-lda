Traditional Neapolitan style pizza, and apparently the ingredients are actually flown in from Italy, as well as the pizza ovens themselves. The space is open and you can see the kitchen at work from the main dining area. There's a spot to grab toppings (think sea salt, garlic, parmesan and crushed red peppers) and olive oil for dipping in the kitchen area. 



We had the Margherita D.O.P and the Diavalo. The salami and peppers are a perfect combo on the Diavalo, and just the right amount of spicy. Fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes on both, which obviously. I also grabbed a Limonata to complete the experience and think back to my recent afternoon Italian escapades.

Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me. Our pizza crust was way too burnt for both pizza - I doubt that's how they should be. This definitely made the pizza taste not as great...

Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico) 

Italian fusion - slightly thicker, breadier crust than tradition and combines American and Italian (i.e. Fellinis) 

American - generally thick-ish crust, cheezy, loaded with toppings (i.e. gameday Papa Johns).

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience. 



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes. 



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time. 



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine. 



I just won't come here again. It's just not my type of place, but to each is own.",11/20/2010 23:57,0,1,2,3,2,6,9/18/2009,5,0,21,1,2,25

They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max. 

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves. 



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D 



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance! 



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens.

Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico)

Italian fusion - slightly thicker, breadier crust than tradition and combines American and Italian (i.e. Fellinis)

American - generally thick-ish crust, cheezy, loaded with toppings (i.e. gameday Papa Johns).

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes.



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time.



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine.

They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max.

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves.



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance!



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens.

Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me. Our pizza crust was way too burnt for both pizza - I doubt that's how they should be. This definitely made the pizza taste not as great...

Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico)

Italian fusion - slightly thicker, breadier crust than tradition and combines American and Italian (i.e. Fellinis)

American - generally thick-ish crust, cheezy, loaded with toppings (i.e. gameday Papa Johns).

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes.



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time.



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine.

They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max.

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves.



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance!



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens.

Traditional Italian - thin crust baked in stone oven at around 800deg for ~1.5min (i.e. Antico)

Italian fusion - slightly thicker, breadier crust than tradition and combines American and Italian (i.e. Fellinis)

American - generally thick-ish crust, cheezy, loaded with toppings (i.e. gameday Papa Johns).

*there are other pizza types but this is a rough categorization without getting too granular (new york, chicago, etc.)



Antico's makes some of the best traditional Italian pizza's you'll get in Atlanta with flavorful toppings served fresh and hot from their wood fired ovens.

When we first arrived we went to the wrong building...twice. How does one do that? From a lack of direction, confusing signs and about 4-5 different restaurants under one business owner. We brought two bottles of wine and awkwardly assumed that we were at the correct spot and sat down in the outdoor area. The owner came over and told us that the byob section was in the other building so we couldn't sit there. He was the best part about the experience. He was so nice and gave us great suggestions and apologized profusely for the inconvenience.



When we went to the correct spot I was instantly turned off. I expected it to be a little more formal I guess? Not super formal but just like a normal place where you can sit at your own table and sip your wine and eat your food in peace, ya know? Absolutely not! They have family style tables and you have to sit next to complete strangers. The manager gave us a great suggestion to find your table before you order so that you can find a table and won't have to stand and eat your pizza, thank God he told us that. It was kinda busy and we had to wait for a table, and then track down a bus boy to wipe it after just standing in front of someone's else's empty plates and napkins for 5 minutes.



Usually I wouldn't mind the family style tables too much but the couple next to us were soooo awkward. They were way too friendly and talked our ear off. When me and my bestie tried to toast, they were like, ""yes! Let's toast"" and shoved their dirty cups next to our cups. To make matters worse, they ended up getting into an argument and asked for our advice about their argument. We felt so uncomfortable and tried to eat our food as soon as possible because they continued to argue the whole time.



When our food came it looked delicious. I ordered the Bianca and what a mistake that was. It tasted like plain bread and had 0 flavor, at all, none, nata, zilch. Get the point? My friend ordered the Lasagna pizza and she thought it was ""cool"", def nothing to rant and rave about. Don't order the Bianca! I rather go to Dominos! It was that bad. Also, there were so many little nats flying around or pizza. My friend had one nat into her last cup of wine.



I just won't come here again. It's just not my type of place, but to each is own.",11/20/2010 23:57,0,1,2,3,2,6,9/18/2009,5,0,21,1,2,25

They have several pre-made choices on the menu, but you can also create your own pizza. I highly recommend the San Gennaro or the Diavola (I probably butchered the spelling but it's close enough! xD). You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends. One pizza can definitely feed 3 people max.

They have a really good bar full of parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes, fresh garlic, red pepper chili paste, marinated peppers, and a salt and pepper mixture. The marinated red peppers are THE BOMB, I could just eat those by themselves.



Drinks must be bought, they have water bottles, selection of sparkling waters, wines and beers. But did I mention this place is BYOB?! Grab your favorite beer and/or wine and bring it with you! There's plastic cups on the tables for people to use. so amazing, I brought a bottle of wine and my boyfriend brought his beer. :D



I love the communal seating and the home-y feel of this place. Just really basic decor and wood seating. It has a nice ambiance!



This place is quite busy on the weekends and holidays, so i'd recommend going to lunch on weekdays, or just arrive early. Honestly the wait isn't too bad, and the pizza comes out so fast since they take no time to cook in those super hot, legit wood burning ovens.

Traditional Neapolitan style pizza, and apparently the ingredients are actually flown in from Italy, as well as the pizza ovens themselves. The space is open and you can see the kitchen at work from the main dining area. There's a spot to grab toppings (think sea salt, garlic, parmesan and crushed red peppers) and olive oil for dipping in the kitchen area.



We had the Margherita D.O.P and the Diavalo. The salami and peppers are a perfect combo on the Diavalo, and just the right amount of spicy. Fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes on both, which obviously. I also grabbed a Limonata to complete the experience and think back to my recent afternoon Italian escapades. If you're into more traditional pizza, this is THE spot to go in the ATL.",9/28/2009 4:53,0,1,2,3,2,6,9/18/2009,5,0,21,1,2,25

I visited this place because someone told me that he drove a few additional hours just to stop by this pizza place again. We ordered San Gennaro, which came with salsiccia, dolce piccante pepper, bufala, and cipolline. We all liked this one much better than the other one. The other pizza that we had was Diavola. Diavola came with spicy sopressata, pepperonata, and bufala. I think San Gennaro is worth trying; however, I personally won't recommend Diavola. It was also pretty spicy to me.
