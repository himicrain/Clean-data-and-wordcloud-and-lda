435211,5,9,10,10,10,10,10,"Cecily is a great host, v hospitable. She helped me get the lay of the land quickly being my first time in Austin and gave me good recommendations for great places to eat, drink and listen to music. The space is certainly enough for 1 person to be comfortable but my assumption is you'll spend v little time there since there's so much to do and see in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Cecily was a nice host. We barely saw her and her daughter (adorable). The bedroom and bathroom were super clean. 
,,,,,,,,Comfortable and quiet- a great place to use as a base for work and for exploring Austin.  Thanks!
,,,,,,,,Perfect location for my stay. Cecily was very accommodating even though I unfortunately didn't get to meet her. 
,,,,,,,,Cecily is a wonderful host.  She communicated very clearly before and during my stay. It was perfect as I just needed a bedroom and bathroom for my quick trip to Austin on business.  
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was very nice and welcoming. The bedroom was spacious, the bed was comfortable and clean, and Cecily set out a pitcher and glasses in our bedroom. She thought of everything! The house was cozy and full of interesting art and books.  It is a basement apartment, so there was not much natural light, and it was slightly stuffy. But overall, it was the perfect place to stay, and we enjoyed it thoroughly. "
,,,,,,,,"Cecily is a charming thoughtful host. I was in town for a festival and kept very late hours. It was nice that lights were always left on for me, and that Cecily made provisions for my breakfast. I enjoyed chatting with her and her adorable daughter. The apartment is basic but cosy and tastefully furnished. It's located in a beautiful area of town that's not too far from Austin's must see sights. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,Cecily was amazing and helpful. The space was perfect for us and the location could not have been better. I would love to stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Another exceptional stay at Cecily's place!  She's truly an amazing hostess and made me feel very welcome.  I really enjoyed my conversations with her about all of the local amenities and events.  She also made sure that my stay was very comfortable, quiet and relaxing.  The room & bathroom were prepared and clean upon my arrival and stayed that way throughout.  Great neighborhood in a great location.  I would definitely stay here again!  Thank you for having me, again, Cecily!  You rock  :)"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and her daughter were wonderful, the place was great and in a great location, and everything went very smoothly. All in all, staying with Cecily made a terrific trip that much better and I would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone coming to Austin! Thanks so much, Cecily!"
,,,,,,,,"My cousin & I very much enjoyed our stay! Cecily is such a warm, welcoming host. The apartment is very charming, and the location is quiet despite its super convenient downtown location! We also found the space very clean!! Thank you for hosting us! "
,,,,,,,,"She makes you feel at home, place is clean, cozy and convenient. Cecily went out of her way to make sure we loved everything. Very sweet lady, and her daughter is an angel ... Lovely family .. We are very greatful !"
,,,,,,,,A wonderful stay and a wonderful home! Thank you very much! 
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a lovely hostess; her home is super central, in downtown Austin just off 6th street. We were offered coffee in the morning and she was very helpful with recommendations and advice. Simply a great place to stay if you want to visit the city"
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful stay. Cecily was so warm and inviting! At the same time, she was really respectful of my space and time as I was in town for business. The home is super cozy, full of character, and very clean. The individual room is quite roomy, and I found it nicely prepared when I arrived. I would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Cecily's place is super centrally located to downtown and all the spots on Sixth street.  I could walk to the mega Whole Foods as well as towards all the clubs and bars.  You have your own window air conditioning unit so you can set your room to whatever A/C level you like.  I was in and out early and late and it was never a problem.  Checkin was flexible too which was nice since I took a redeye in and arrived even earlier than anticipated.
,,,,,,,,"Cecily made me feel welcome, the neighbourhood was nice and quiet and reasonably close to downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Simple, comfortable room on a quiet corner in a leafy neighborhood just a few blocks from center of the Austin action. Cecily is a friendly and accommodating host. Just two blocks from Walton's for great breakfast / coffee / snacks. Very interesting house and gardens."
,,,,,,,,"Cecily is in the basement apartment in a gorgeous building. The upstairs landlord, Blair, was very nice as well. We had a large bed and a private bedroom at the end of the hall in her apartment. I found the bed to be rather hard, but I do have a sensitive back. Cecily's daughter is adorable and both of them were very welcoming. You just can't beat the location! Walking distance to tons of bars and restaurants, the Capitol, and if you don't mind a longer walk, you could get to UT Austin. All in all a great trip, great location and very nice people."
,,,,,,,,"Cecily took great care of us! She set up our room with water, a well made bed, towels, all of the necessary amenities. The home is very ""austin-y,"" with lots of fun/interesting furniture and accessories. We very much felt at home while staying here, and would recommend Cecily's home to anyone looking for a great stay in Austin. Thanks again Cecily! :)"
,,,,,,,,We had an excellent stay at Cecily's - the room is cozy and clean and exactly as described.  The flat is very central.  Cecily was a wonderful host - very communicative and welcoming and completely cool and willing to let you get to it and do your thing.   I couldn't imagine a nicer place to stay.
,,,,,,,,"What's left to say that hasn't already been said?! I loved my time in Cecily's home. The house is perfectly located; I was able to walk anywhere I wanted to go. The room was spacious and comfortable, and it had all the amenities I could possibly have needed (extra blankets, an iron & ironing board, cold water, a mini fridge, a robe). The bed was super comfy! I loved the decor and the lived-in feeling of the place. I only met Cecily (and Posey!) briefly, but it was a pleasure. Definitely stay here if you have the chance!"
,,,,,,,,"Really exceptional experience, I feel fortunate to have booked with Cecily. Very nice private space, with a small fridge, iron and ironing board, AC in the room, lovely home/neighborhood and great access to downtown Austin. Cecily and her charming daughter Posey were a joy to visit with during my stay.  Couldn't have been better, will look forward to staying there again on my next trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately, we didn't have a good experience at all. We just drove up there from San Antonio and our experience with Airbnb was flawless there until we reached Austin. Now that I look back at the pictures in the listing, it seems like additional lighting was used for those photos. This place was extremely depressing. The lighting was horrible and no, you do not â€œget plenty of lightâ€ as mentioned in the listing. It's Sub-level. The walls were blue, cracked with plenty of dust in the room. My friend and I tried to leave the house as early as we could everyday and stay out as much as time allowed, because it felt like a prison cell- quiet depressing. Yes, this place is close to downtown but Uber rides are so dirt cheap in Austin  (around $5.50 every time I used one) that itâ€™s better to be at a slightly farther location that is actually cheaper, and youâ€™ll still save money. . Considering everything I mentioned, this place was WAY overpriced. With lots expensive food and drink choices, our 3 days in Austin cost us only ~$500 (for 2 ppl - yes, itâ€™s that cheap in Austin). It is unbelievable that we paid nearly $300 (after fees) to stay here. Lastly, we got to meet the host twice. I don't recommend this place.  "
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect for my brief trip to Austin for a conference. The location was very convenient to walk to the heart of downtown. Cecily and her daughter were inviting and kind and her home was comfortable. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"I was staying at Cecily's place because I had a convention to attend in Austin. Cecily's house is very convenient to downtown, almost everywhere can be walking distance.  Also Cecily is such a caring person. Her daughter is adorable too. I'd like to stay her place again. "
,,,,,,,,"Does this Airbnb even need another glowing 5-star review? Quit looking around and reserve the place, already! I have nothing but great things to say about our stay at Cecily's. The room was spacious, the bed was huge and comfortable, and the noise from the rest of the house was deadened so that even a spunky toddler didn't wake us up. The house is in a great location - we walked to Barton Springs Pool, Zilker Botanical Garden, Franklin BBQ, all up and down 6th street, the State Capital, and more! The only time we took an Uber was to be dropped off at South Congress - we walked back.
Cecily was very responsive to all our needs and accommodated our schedule. And, as if all of this wasn't enough to convince you to stay, Cecily left us a sweet little Valentine, as we were there on Valentine's day.
Great location, great house, great host. Thanks for everything, Cecily. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, convenient to numerous restaurants and nightlife. We spent most of our time out enjoying the city, and appreciated the quiet and comfortable room at the end of the day. It was very easy to stay in contact with Cecily via text to ask questions and confirm arrival/departure times, and we felt right at home. And her daughter is so sweet and friendly!"
,,,,,,,,"It was a lovely experience to stay with Cecily - I couldn't possibly recommend her more highly as a host, or recommend her space more highly as a jumping-off point into Austin. The home is beautiful, the bedroom is private and comfortable, and coming and going was a breeze. The house is a quick stroll to the Austin city center, and I've been left with some serious Austin envy as a fatigued New Yorker. Cecily knew the area well and had some great advice for local eats (even for rascally vegans like me). Please consider staying here on your visit to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great time. The location is downtown and Cecily was a very accommodating host.
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and Posey provided comfortable accommodations and we're very hospitable.

If you are a sole traveler in search of an alternative to $120/$150 a night hotel's in downtown then this is the right place for you.

Once I dropped my suitcase I was able to walk *everywhere* within 10 to 15 minutes! Super location."
,,,,,,,,Cecily was a great host and very accommodating with my check in and check out schedule. The apartment is within walking distance of downtown and was very clean and welcoming.
,,,,,,,,"My stay with Cecily and Posey was absolutely delightful!  Every morning I was greeted with warmth and gracious hospitality.  Their home is very welcoming, exactly as described.  The neighborhood was very convenient for me; close enough to the convention center that I could get there easily, and yet far enough away that it was a neighborhood.  It was also very close to Whole Foods, Trader Joes and miles of riverside trails.  I was able to eat home-cooked food and enjoy long runs in-between my activities at the convention center."
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a fantastic host! The room had everything I needed for my short stay. Cecily was welcoming, helpful, and yet provided me with plenty of space. I had no trouble contacting her when I needed something. The bed was comfortable, and the neighborhood felt safe, yet was close enough to walk downtown. Highly recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay!  Cecily's place was nicer than described.  The best part was the welcome feeling we received prior to arrival.  The accommodations were perfect and you could not ask for a better location.  I was originally concerned about the bed but it turned out more comfortable than our own.  The fridge in the room and cold water were a nice touch.  It was great to meet the family and talk everything Austin.  Awesome all around!
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a wonderful host, and her place was wonderful.  Great location, just a few blocks away from everything.  It really is the perfect location as it's two blocks away from Sixth Street so you hear nothing from the home but just minutes away from all the activity."
,,,,,,,,Cecily was such an amazing host! The experience was exactly what I expected and matched the description on AirBNB. Cecily was super friendly and made me feel right at home. I would definitely stay again! Thank you for having me!
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a great host! Her home is in an unbeatable location just two blocks from 6th street. We used the B-Cycles to get around town which was a perfect way to see the city, and there was a B-Cycle station just 2 blocks away. The house is located a few blocks from the biggest Whole Foods, 2 blocks from a bike-only trail, and 2 miles from Barton Springs."
,,,,,,,,"I had a very good experience staying at Cecily's place.  The room is spacious.  With the bed set up as a single there was plenty of room for my daily yoga practice.  And Cecily did a lot to make me comfortable.  The simple breakfast was elegant and delicious, she provided a terrycloth robe, and she had a pitcher of water waiting for me--much appreciated in the Texas heat.  I had a key, came and went as I pleased, and felt at home.

The location is within walking distance of restaurants, clubs, and other businesses.  It's also just a few blocks from a station for BCycle, the bicycle sharing system.  There is a driveway for off-street parking. "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was lovely! The family was welcoming, flexible, helpful, and personable. The room was as described with a very big bed. There was a window AC unit and a mini fridge in the room. We didn't rent a car and the bus stops were very close. We would definitely stay here again and I recommend it."
,,,,,,,,Cecily's was a great host and offered a great size room and living space. She had a spare key so I could come and go as I pleased and she had plenty of tips and suggestions about the area. Her place was just 2-3 blocks from a few restaurants and only 2+ blocks from several bars and restaurants. 
,,,,,,,,"Cecily really makes you feel welcome! She is a wonderful and kind host. The house is so cosy and pleasant, and the neighbourhood is very quiet and nice. It's very close to the Austin Convention Centre and a great Whole Foods store. Really recommend staying at Cecily's!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was very accommodating during mine and my boyfriends' stay.  I was in Austin for a conference and I wasn't sure too sure when I'd be able to arrive to the room so luckily she was flexible. The location was great - we had our car but we walked everywhere. The room description is accurate and it was perfect for us. We love exploring where we go so the downtime we had, we would hop onto the internet which was quite fast! Great stay. "
,,,,,,,,Cecily was a wonderful host start to finish! Everything was exactly as described and the location can't be beat. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time at Cecily's place! Austin is a great time - and her place was the perfect base for our adventures. We were able to walk or ride bikes to all of the attractions we wanted to see - 6th street, Rainey street, Barton Springs, Congress Bridge, etc. Even though her place is so close to the action, our room was very quiet and we slept great! The room was quiet and dark with a king size bed. Cecily was very friendly and gave us great recommendations about what to see and do in the city. We were even lucky enough to get a ride to the airport from Cecily - which was really going above and beyond with hospitality. Thank you for everything Cecily!! "
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a wonderful host, incredibly kind and welcoming. The space was just as she described it and catered to our every need. The neighborhood was steps away from Downtown Austin but perfectly hidden away from the hustle and bustle of 6th Street. We were able to walk to almost everywhere, and never had any issues coming and going whenever we pleased. Cecily's daughter was absolutely adorable and very well behaved, considering she is a toddler who wakes up early in the morning, we barely ever heard her and when we did, it was the cutest thing. The entire space was clean and very well taken care of. The bed was HUGE, that was a great plus. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and are happy that our first experience with airbnb was so pleasant. "
,,,,,,,,This was my first airb&b experience and it was great.  Cecily was a wonderful host.  Her place was clean and inviting.  The location was perfect.
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a perfect host who provided amazing hospitality and great insight on things to do around Austin. She had a welcome book that included brochures of destinations and maps of downtown.

Her neighborhood was awesome and very convenient. Cecily lives right next to 6th street which had many great restaurants such as Walton's (which has an incredible breakfast sandwich). There was a ""B Cycle"" a few blocks away which we could ride to any point of interest. Since her home was near the center of the city, it was easy to explore every district that Austin has to offer.

If you are looking for an airbnb location in downtown Austin, I would extremely recommend staying with Cecily."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great 5 day trip in Austin staying at Cecily's.

Cecily's place is in an excellent location-we didn't rent a car so it was ideal to be just a few blocks from downtown. It was pretty easy to walk and occasionally take the bus to explore the city.

Cecily was a very courteous and informative host and she provided plenty of tips on things to do and how to get around town.  Her daughter Posey was absolutely adorable!

Our room was very spacious and comfortable with A/C, a mini fridge, a dresser, bathrobes, and plenty of outlets.  The house itself is lovely, with a beautiful yard full of flowers and palm trees.

I highly recommend staying at Cecily's for a great Austin experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Very simple and good contact with Cecily. Arrival was smooth and friendly. Apartment looks exactly what I expected from the photos. Fine bed. Price is fair for this neighborhood (lot's restaurants, bars, very central). The location is superb!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a great host. Her apartment is very conveniently located, and we could walk to everything. The room was nice, and she was very considerate about making sure that we had everything that we needed."
,,,,,,,,"Though it was a basement, space, we had a pleasant and cosy experience staying at Cecily's place! The weather was unexpectedly cold when we were up in Austin, but fortunately Cecily provided us a space heater to warm us up. Posey was also very adorable!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was so nice! She was very welcoming and made my friend and I feel at home right away. We arrived late and were so fortunate that she was awake and waiting for us, very nice of her. We had a very comfy bed and a great size room. The only bad point of the bed was that the blankets were a bit small so my friend and I were playing tug of war. She did supply us with more blankets so the second night was better. She supplied us with a binder full of past reviews from customers and things to do in the city which helped us a lot. In the morning she had coffee waiting for us in which was a godsend! She had a lot of helpful recommendations of things to do. I'm bummed we didn't get to meet Posey, but we heard her a little in the mornings and she seemed adorable!  We had such an amazing experience at Cecily's and I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a great host and provided exactly what we were looking for - friendly but non-intrusive. She gave us some great recommendations for eats around the neighborhood!

The bed, though a futon, was enough to provide us with several cozy and comfortable nights' sleep. 

The best part of the stay is its central location; can't beat the 10-minute walk to bars and live music around Austin. If we go back, we'll totally reach out to Cecily again!
"
,,,,,,,,"Staying with Cecily was a really wonderful experience. We came at an unreasonably cold time (for Austin) and she provided extra blankets and a space heater. She made breakfast in the morning, told us where to get BBQ tacos, and was generally just such a sweet host."
,,,,,,,,"Cecily's place was warm, welcoming, and clean. Because it's conveniently located downtown, it makes for a great base to explore Austin. My husband and I slept soundly and found Cecily to be very accommodating. We also used the well-equipped kitchen to make ourselves breakfast and reheat some food; it's a luxury to have access to a great kitchen when traveling. I'd stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Cecily was a fantastic host and was incredibly accommodating. Also the location couldn't be better! I feel so lucky to have been able to stay. Highly recommended. 
,,,,,,,,"Great stay with Cecily. Location is central (2 blocks from the first bars and restos, just a 10-min walk from 6th St, and 3 blocks from buses to take you anywhere) but it was quiet and peaceful at the house. Cecily was very helpful and friendly, and Posey was fun to play with! She was actually pretty well-behaved and the door blocks enough of the noise, so don't let that stop you. Just a little dark since it's a basement, but other than that, everything was great!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and her little familiy were very warm and welcoming. Big thanx to that. And even the whole house, the flat is in, is very open, arty and welcoming.Thanx to Blair, the one of a kind landlord! I very quickly felt home and happy to be part of the whole thing. On the other hand I did have perfect privacy when ever I felt like it. Posey the little toddler was just an amazing sweety! Smiling all over her face everytime I saw her. As I was in Austin due to a Conference I didn't have as much time as I would have wanted to have with Cecily and Posey, but that's the way it is.
Thanx for that great week, I would definitely come back."
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed staying here. The place is very well-located in the city (a 10-minute walk to 6th and Congress) and on a nice, relatively quiet street. The place is straightforward and cozy; though small, it's easy to get privacy. Cecily is a lovely host and is very flexible when it comes to arrival and departure times, and all other comings and goings. If I need an Airbnb the next time I come to Austin, I would happily reach out to Cecily again."
,,,,,,,,"Cecily's place was very nice. Located in a very convenient place as it was very quiet but quite close to the living heart of the city (6th street). The bedroom was very neat, clean and comfortable.
Cecily was very kind and welcoming, and gave me precious advice for visiting the city. And the little child was absolutely adorable :)
Definitely recommend this spot!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was a wonderful host and my trip was delightful. The home was ecclectic and inviting and wonderfully located within walking distance to downtown, whole foods and the river. My stay was wonderful and Cecily was very helpful with directions and recommendations. I highly recommend staying as an alternative to busy, expensive downtown hotels!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily was very helpful and really kind. She made us coffee every morning, and helped us find what we were looking for whenever we asked. She also had a very helpful book with suggested things to do and restaurants around town in the room. Thanks Cecily!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a really great time staying with Cecily, Phillip, and their daughter. They were very welcoming and recommended some great places to check out. The house is wonderful and in an amazing location. I definitely recommend staying with them if you have the chance. "
,,,,,,,,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience than staying Cecily, Phil and their beautiful daughter.  They were all warm and inviting hosts, I felt at home my entire stay in their apartment, and their daughter is a complete sweetheart.  Cecily and Phil were great at offering advice on what to do and how to get around, and Cecily was even kind enough to invite me to join them in going to the Salt Lick outside of Austin, which was amazing!  Cecily also makes really great coffee :)  The room was exactly as listed, the futon bed was quite comfortable, and the A/C unit kept the room nice and cool, even threw the heat of an Austin summer day.  I would definitely recommend for anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily & Phil were wonderful hosts! Coffee each morning, nice, cold air conditioned  room with the Austin heat & humidity. Very comfortable bed & large room for my 4 night stay. Really augmented my Austin experience! "
,,,,,,,,"great experience in Austin. was definitely able to get a feel for the ""real"" Austin, main reason why I prefer airbnb over standard hotels. the location is great and the hosts are very accommodating with any of your needs. great place to enjoy Austin.

Also their baby is super adorable"
,,,,,,,,I had a wonderful stay. They had good advice on where to eat. Good walking distance to much of downtown. Clean comfortable room. 
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at the 'Austin Historic home bedroom only' with Cecily, Phil, and their beautiful 18month daughter.  Although I was only in the apartment for 5 hours at a time, because of all the SXSW events going on, I felt as if I were at a family members home.  Slept on a comfy futon.  House was clean.  They offered breakfast, but I was always rushing out of the house and I never had the chance to sit down and eat with them.  I LOVED the location, it was 2 blocks away from where I needed to DJ.  I highly recommend staying there, hope I'm able to stay at the same location next year.  Thank you Cecily & Phil I enjoyed my convos and staying at your lovely home.  Cheers. "
,,,,,,,,Thank you for your hospitality. I thoroughly appreciated you guys let me hang out besides offering the room. Great location and I wi be back soon! 
,,,,,,,,"My son and I had a wonderful stay with Cecily, Phil and their adorable daughter. Their apartment is very comfortable and the location cannot be beat. They had wonderful suggestions for activities and places to eat and really made our stay in Austin great. "
,,,,,,,,Great house and great family to stay with. House was very comfortable and the family was very friendly. Thanks for letting us use the bicycle and the umbrella!  Only issue is that there was a couple of waits for the bathroom - one bathroom and four adults + baby = hang out for a couple of minutes till the door opens.
,,,,,,,,"There were no surprises in the accommodations; everything matched the description. The hosts are positive, sunny, and all-around lovely people. I would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay here was an invaluable experience for my wife and me.  We visited Austin from the northeast to scout it out for a potential move next year -- this is a very big & scary thing for us.
We could not thank Cecily & Fam enough for their warmth and hospitality; their influence on our experience in this city was vast and incredibly informative.
Besides how awesome they were, the location and house are both AMAZING!  Cannot stress how awesome the location was for walking downtown, through the green belt, to Zilker Park, to Wholefoods, to see bats under the Congress Ave bridge, et cetera. (disclaimer: we're NYers and don't mind walking 20 minutes to take in neighborhoods and atmosphere). (PS: Zip car cars also located TWO street blocks away -- amazing!) Look the location up and see how central it is for yourself.
If you're looking for an authentic stay in Austin, in an incredibly historic and beautiful home, centered in the heart of downtown we can't recommend this place more highly.
Thanks again for a wonderful vacation and view into our future."
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and her family were incredibly warm and welcoming during my Austin visit - I'm still reflecting upon what a great time I had during my time there, and their hospitality was a very big part of it. Everything was clean and accommodating, the hosts themselves friendly and helpful, with hints on things to try and places to see, as well as a helpful insider's look on the changing city itself. Very highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily andv Phil both made my time in Austin very enjoyable. They make their guest feel right at home in their home. Both very easy to be around and also very generous with their knowledge of Austin and America. The room is very spacious and being partially underground, the home is a cool  haven when the Austin sun is hot. I would highly recommend a visit with Cecily and Phil if you are going to Austin. Also the location is great, very close to downtown and in a quiet area. "
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and Phil were great hosts! We stayed for 4 nights. The room was really big and comfortable, stocked with all the essentials. They recommended some great things for us to check out during our stay and we definitely weren't disappointed. The location of the apartment can't be beat--we were within a couple blocks of everything that was worth doing. There was some construction going on at their intersection, so getting there and parking was a little tricky, but of course that's not their fault. We would definitely stay there again!

P.S. The little one is adorable :)
P.P.S. Beg Phil to make you a waffle."
,,,,,,,,Loved staying here! The location was perfect and the room was cozy.  I was hesitant about the futon but it was actually very comfortable.  Cecily was a great host and we always felt comfortable.  The only thing is there was loud construction outside while we were staying- in the future I would ask about that.  But I would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and her husband have a nice, well-located home and provided everything I could want.  They were good hosts.  I'd recommend them."
,,,,,,,,"Our trip to Austin didn't start out exactly like we had planned but Cecily and Phil made everything so great and we ended up having a fantastic time in Austin.  They are incredibly warm and positive people. We enjoyed everything about our stay with them from the wonderful breakfast and coffee to the interesting conversations about travel, food, and culture.  The room was very comfortable (one of the most comfortable futons ever!) and clean and their location is very close to shopping, restaurants, and sightseeing.  The overall value is great and they gave us a key to their unit so we could come and go as we pleased.  We felt very safe in their neighborhood.  I highly recommend staying with Cecily and Phil if you are staying in Austin and want to explore the downtown area.  It's a great place to stay and you will not be disappointed!"
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and Phil were fantastic hosts - made me feel very welcome, full access to the kitchen, very helpful with tips and suggestions and fun as well and very good quality towels - in fact the best quality I've had on my travels with airbnb. I hired Cecily's bike which was the best way to get around although it was a bit hot - a few just under or over 100 degrees days! Austin is fabulous and there's live music just a block or two from the house. Would highly recommend both of them and their home. "
,,,,,,,,"Cecily and Phil were amazing! Even when my request was last-minute, they replied immediately and we arranged the stay. They were very accommodating and made me feel like home. We even went to a bar and chatted about movies, politics, evolution and all things Darwin. 

The room is very cozy and the futon was surprisingly comfortable. In addition, the simple fact of waking up to home-made waffles made my mornings. They also handed me a set of keys and gave me the space I needed. I had a great time in Austin and most of it was because of them."
,,,,,,,,"Very nice and helpful hosts, great location! It worked out on very short notice. "
9561101,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Michael was a lovely host. He welcomed us personally to show us around his house (which is super well equipped) and gave us great tips about how to spend our time in Austin. Kind of fell in love with Wholefoods (slightly embarrassed about how much time was spent there, ha) and the rest of Austin too. Thanks for everything. "
,,,,,,,,"Mike is an outstanding host! He took the time to show us around and also gave us some great Austin history and restaurant suggestions. The house is super close in to all 6th St has to offer. It is tucked away in a somewhat industrial alleyway, so noise ways sometimes an issue. (Garage trucks, trains etc) But that is part of the fun in a 100 year old house! Looking forward to visiting Austin again!"
,,,,,,,,"Michael & his place were a great place to stay while we were in Austin.   He was very prompt in answering all of our questions, he gave us a nice warm intro to his house and the surrounding area with some very good suggestions!

Location: walking distance to market (~5min) and most things in downtown (~15 mins at the furthest). A bit hard to find when you first show up as its down an alleyway, but the location is not sketchy at all.  Turn down the alleyway where cowgirls & flowers is located and you can't miss it.

House: We put 8 people here really comfortably.  The 1 bathroom never ran out of hot water.  Michael has stocked the house with anything you could possibly need.

Overall, very nice stay.   Would recommend to anyone."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"A few of my friends and I had the pleasure of staying in Michael's house during weekend 1 of Austin City Limits. It was the perfect location! We were able to walk everywhere. The beds were comfortable and we had ample space for the 4 of us. Michael was very easy to communicate with and he was there to greet us, give us a tour and shared many recommendations. It was a great stay! Thank you, Michael!"
,,,,,,,,Mike was very helpful and very cool guy. Loved his place! Perfect location 
,,,,,,,,Michael was very accommodating and communicated well with myself and my guests while we stayed there.  Location is great and the price is right. Would definitely stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,"Awesome host, place, location, value, communication!!!!

Epic trip and place to stay!!!"
,,,,,,,,"We had an awesome stay here! The house was an easy walking distance to 6th street bars and 24 diner.  Michael was such a good host. He let us know about several restaurants to try within a couple blocks of the house, and they were tasty."
,,,,,,,,"Host made us feel very welcome and even went as far as asking the business next door if we could park our Boat in the parking lot of the neighboring business's parking lot. Very pleased with the home and location. The home is quaint and comfortable, not a lol of upgrades in as far as Granite and bathroom remodel but the location trumps all of that easily. "
,,,,,,,,Great home! The description was accurate and the photos were very helpful to show the house. Everything was perfect and the house had everything we needed. We came for a bachelorette party and we easily slept 7 girls in the available beds. Perfect location as you could walk to many places nearby. The parking spot was a little tight for my small crossover but still worked out perfectly for us. So thankful to Mike! He was also very flexible as we were driving and running behind our original check in time. 
,,,,,,,,Host was very welcoming when we arrived. Showed us completely through the house as well as provided us with tips for near by food and nightlife. The house was located walking distance from 6th street as well as walking distance to whole foods. Nice two bedroom house that was perfect for our group. 
,,,,,,,,We stayed here for a weekend and had a great experience! The house is adorable and feels very warm and comfortable. Highly recommended!!
,,,,,,,,"I had a chance to book Michaels home in Downtown Austin for a last minute trip. Michael was responsive accommodating and very helpful. His  home was fantastic well appointed and walking distance to everything. Exactly what we needed. I would definitely stay with him again
"
,,,,,,,,"CUTEST HOUSE EVER! There was 6 girls that stayed here for a bachelorette trip and we ALL LOVED IT.  I would have to say that for 6 girls - this place slept us ALL comfortably with plenty of room!  The house has so much charm and it has PERFECT LOCATION we were able to walk to 6th street, and so many wonderful restaurants within a block of the house.  Also, Michael was an amazing host... he greeted us when we arrived gave us a little tour and even recommended some places! I highly recommend staying here, you won't be disappointed!  "
2967570,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Crystal's place is beautiful, stylish and in a great location. The shower is amazing and the bed is comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked with the little things you need while you're staying there. Crystal's communication was excellent throughout the process. Take a look at her guidebook which has very good dining recommendations. We look forward to staying here again. Thank you, Crystal!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a really positive experience staying at Crystal's place in Austin.  The apartment was exactly as advertised and to some degree looked even better in person.  Crystal was communicative and helpful, the welcome book she has for guests contains a ton of info.  The check in and check out process went really smoothly.  I learned that Austin is a pretty spread out city, so quality of the location would depend on what you want to do and the type of transport you have.  I didn't rent a car and used Fasten/walked to get around and was able to see most every part of the city itself.  If you're pretty active like me, it's walkable to downtown, Rainey St, 6th st, Lamar, etc.  Great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"The location couldn't be better.  You're in the heart of Austin and can easily walk to restaurants, bars, and tourist spots.  The apartment had modern appliances and easy parking.  Crystal responded quickly and let me check out late.  Between location, apartment quality, and Crystal's kindness, I'd love to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Had a wonderful overall experience. Place was exactly as described and pictures doesn't do it justice. Check In/Check Out process was nice and easy and  would recommend to anyone!  
,,,,,,,,Awesome space awesome place! So clean and they thought of everything! One of the best spaces yet. close enough to get involved in the city life but far enough to be private as well! Awesome Host! 
,,,,,,,,"We have stayed at multiple places of Crystals and we are never disappointed. We had a very comfortable stay, kitchen and bathroom are well equipped. The patio was great and plenty of space in the rental. Location also couldn't be better, we highly recommend this place! "
,,,,,,,,Great stay... everything was as promised and more! 
,,,,,,,,Great place! Every possible amenity provided. Had a wonderful visit to Austin! Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was great, she provided all of the information we needed and her place was perfect for us."
,,,,,,,,Crystal was very communicative and provided excellent details about the apartment and recommendations for what to do around town. The place looks exactly like the pictures- clean and modern. I highly recommend staying at her perfectly located apartment!
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was great with communication prior to staying at her place and gave great directions for easy in and out.  Her place was very clean, tidy and was a quick walk to the action on 6th street.  There was plenty of products available to use and had great towels.  I would definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,The host was very easy to communicate with giving easy check in instructions and lots of recommendations left in a folder at the apartment. Super cool warehouse style loft in a good location. She left the fridge stocked with stuff also which was very nice. Thanks for the great stay in austin!
,,,,,,,,Great location and beautiful apt. Crystal was very responsive and it was easy to find the apt and get in. It's exactly like the pictures and very clean with a comfy tempurpedic bed.  The neighbors can be a little noisy but that was our only complaint and it was Halloween weekend. The apt is on a cool street with a lot of restaurants and shops. 
,,,,,,,,"Very spacious one bedroom place near freeway. It's a bit of a walk to the downtown area, but definitely doable! Bed was comfy and we loved how dark the bedroom was for sleeping in on our vacation! "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal is a fantastic host, with tons of great recommendations. Her condo is perfect, exactly as described, if not better. Lots of space, clean, extra toiletries, etc. We had a group of 4 so we used the air mattress and couch but we were all still very comfortable and had plenty of space. The location is AMAZING, quick and easy walk to the neat restaurants and bars on 6th and rainey st and to the Capital building and UT. Short ride in a fasten car (taxi app) to head to other areas of Austin like S.Congress. There is great taco truck across the street from the apartment â€“ we ate there 3 times in 2 days and preferred it to some other popular taco joints. We all agreed weâ€™d stay there again in a heartbeat â€“ definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,This apartment was wonderful! My wife and I got married this weekend and wanted something closer to the venue. Crystal was very communicative and we really enjoyed our stay there. The apartment is centrally located and everything we needed was just a short walking distance away! I would highly recommend this place!
,,,,,,,,"Crystal did an excellent job communicating with us and making us feel welcome. The neighborhood was NOT what we expected nor wanted. We arrived late from ACL and felt unsafe. The surrounding area had many homeless people sleeping on the streets and asking for money. The entire complex is surrounded by metal gates with security codes, so this is not a recent problem. The streets we littered with garbage and filth, a sanitary pad smeared with feces and old clothing was in front of the metal gate. We paid over 400.00 a night, not worth the price."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at this apartment was super easy and very conveniently located. I'd say it is even better than it looks on the website. While one might think that being as close to the highway as it is, it would loud, it was actually quite the opposite, very quiet and peaceful. We used the local ride sharing app, Fasten (suggested by Crystal since Uber and Lyft are no longer in Austin) for our longer adventures and the proximity to 45 and 6th street were just very convenient. There are lots of great things right around the apartment including great coffee and taco truck just across the street. This neighborhood is still s but rough around the edges but we didn't experience any (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication with Crystal was fast clear and easy and she was very accommodating. 

Cheers! "
,,,,,,,,The host was very helpful and accommodating. The check in and check it process was clear and concise. Gorgeous and clean loft! Great views and would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"Awesome place-within walking distance of everything-secure parking and great amenities.
The host was super communicative and helpful.
Best Air b&b experience to date :)"
,,,,,,,,Amazing apartment close to some good restaurants. 
,,,,,,,,"Everything from check-in to check-out went incredibly smoothly. Crystal was a fantastic and helpful host and this apartment was perfect for our weekend in Austin! Very clean, spacious, safe, and in a great neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,This is exactly what I was looking for in terms of location and caliber.  I opted for airbnb for my work trip as it was more affordable than hotels literally across the street at 3/4 of the price and quadruple in size.   I have sent colleagues to this home before so I knew what to expect and was happy to experience the comfort and space as a guest for the first time.
,,,,,,,,"Had a wonderful stay, the location and amenities were prime and Crystal was an attentive host. "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's home was the perfect home base for my latest visit to Austin. We were in walking distance to all the new and fun stuff on the East side of Austin but also minutes away from downtown and South Congress. Super quick access to the highway and had a reserved parking spot that is gated. Check in and out was super easy and quick.

Her clean home (shoes off at door, yes!) had all the amenities we needed for our stay plus extra perks. Including a nice nook with turntable and tons of vinyls and a pay-it-forward beer and liquor system (although we did not partake, we appreciated the option!). Would def love to stay here again during my next visit to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay. We really liked the location as it was away from the hustle and bustle of the CBD.  So many great little bars and restaurants within walking distance to the Apartment.

The Apartment had everything we needed and more. Very comfortable stay. Loved sitting on the couch and watching the constantly changing view!"
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was an excellent host for my first Air B&B. She was helpful before my arrival with recommendations specific to what I wanted to experience and quick to respond to any questions. We arrived late at night and wasn't sure about the neighborhood, but access to the condo was extremely easy! Once inside, we were blown away by this cool modern place! All the extras that were included were awesome! We appreciate the use and replace system. It was nice to be welcomed with such generosity. My friend and I agreed it was way better than staying at a hotel. As for the neighborhood, after exploring the first day, we realized it is an ideal neighborhood with less touristy places, but walking distance to dirty sixth and Rainey Street. We walked everywhere with ease and were shocked how close everything was. Overall, I highly recommend this place and will stay there every time I visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The communication was awesome. The gate code changed like 3 days before my stay, and I received a notification email with the new code. If I didn't get that email, I would have been stuck outside the gate when I arrived at 11pm. 

The location was perfect, close to The Bee Grocery and other spots. I stay in Austin a lot and I might try and make this my spot when I'm in town. "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful place and Crystal was a great host.
,,,,,,,,Cool spot and location!
,,,,,,,,"Not that it even needs another 5 star review, but here it is! You won't regret renting this place. It's a great deal for the space and location. I love the views, record player, big open floor plan, and super comfortable bed. I will absolutely be returning and highly recommend Crystal's apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Great host; very reliable and willing to help you with anything. Place was clean, close to everything downtown. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who was thinking about renting it. "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal made the check in process seamless with easy directions.  She was responsive to any question and very accommodating.  The place is exactly as shown on the pictures and as described with no surprises.  The apartment is located in a great area close to many places (dining, shopping, etc.).  "
,,,,,,,,This apartment is perfect for your Austin experience.  A quick cab ride or walk to 6th Street and the convention center.
,,,,,,,,"This is great little pad in a cool spot of town. We were well within walking distance to the city and everything we needed. 

Food trucks over the road weren't bad and further down 6th street we found lots of cute little places to eat and see. We would definitely stay here agin for location and comfort. Place has everything we needed and more. "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's space was absolutely perfect for my weekend stay in Austin. Between the location (6th and Rainey St. were a short walk away), amenities/suggestions provided, decorations and comfort of the bed, I truly couldn't have asked for a better spot to stay at. We didn't have a single issue and everything was clearly spelled out, but Crystal was extremely responsive when I did contact her. 

Zero complaints about this condo- If i'm ever back in Austin, I'll be sure to plan it around being able to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was such a wonderful host. This was our first time using Airbnb as well as our first time in Austin, TX and she took all the stress out of it. The rental was well-appointed, stocked and ready for arrival. Due to an earlier flight, Crystal was eager to accommodate us for an early check in which was a life-saver. Wonderful city, excellent place stay and a super host!"
,,,,,,,,Loved staying here! The apartment was beautifully furnished and the bed was very comfortable. It is located in walking distance to many great restaurants and attractions. I definitely recommend. 
,,,,,,,,Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during my last visit to Austin! The location was perfect and made it possible to get to all parts of the city in a short period of time whether walking or taking a cab. I also loved how clean it was and how it felt like a home away from home. Anything we could have needed was provided during our visit. Thank you to Crystal for everything and for being so flexible when we unexpectedly needed a later check out! I hope to stay at your place again during my next visit to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Crystal's apartment in Austin is perfectly located. Right in front of delicious food trucks and down the street from really cool bars on the east side and more popular bars on the west of the highway. The apartment itself is so lush. Beautifully decorated. Very comfortable. I definitely will be renting again when I return to Austin. Five Stars! Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,"The place was amazing, the kind of apartment that makes you feel truly at home abd relaxed. There was an abundance of toilitries for us to use and the kitchen had all the essentials we needed to cook the few times we did. I would absolutley recomend this place to a friend."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was extremely helpful throughout our stay, responding to my messages quickly. The property was better than we could have ever expected and the location was ideal! I would thoroughly recommend this apartment and Crystal as a host.

Thank you for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,Amazing apartment in a great location! Communication with Crystal before and during our stay was easy and we had a great time in Austin!
,,,,,,,,We had such a great stay at this apartment. The location was unbelievable; literally minutes from the party-town vibe of 6th Street. The perfect place to stay in Austin!! Thank you.
,,,,,,,,Crystal's place was conveniently located and more than well-equipped for a perfect stay in Austin. Crystal always answered any questions I had very promptly. Would definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,"From the moment we booked Crystal's place, she began communicating to us what we could expect at her rental. And any subsequent communication, she responded an hour. The rental could not have been any more perfect, especially for fans of modern decor. It is centrally located to all the top destinations in Austin. Her rental was fully stocked with all essentials and then some. I would recommend Crystal's rental to anyone who needs a place in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's place was perfect! We felt right at home. It was clean, super cute, had a great view and nice, central location. We were able to walk to several different areas of town - 6th, Rainey, etc. We didn't want to leave! Would definitely recommend and stay again. "
,,,,,,,,Location was very good especially if you want to try the famous Franklin BBQ!
,,,,,,,,"The loft was exactly as described! Spacious, came with extra beds if needed - and all very comfortable. Perfect location, in my opinion. They provided a welcome packet that was very detailed and thorough - really helped with checking in and out."
,,,,,,,,Crystal was great. Super responsive and accomodating!
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay!  The location was in walking distance to East Austin bars and restaurants as well as 6th street downtown, and a short cab to South Congress. The apartment was super spacious, clean, comfortable and equipped with all the amenities and a lot of extras. Crystal provided very clear instructions for getting into the apt and suggestions for things to do around town. Would totally stay there next time I am in Austin!
"
,,,,,,,,What a great place to stay.  Exactly as described. Condo has a great Industrial vibe with lots of attention to detail/decor. The location was perfect for walking to Sixth street. Crystal was great.  Lots of tips before we arrived and welcome packet laid out everything you needed to know. Would definitley recommend to friends and family.
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! The place was clean, well stocked, and easy to live in. Check in was easy as was check out. The neighborhood was awesome. Everything was a short walk away. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was exactly as advertised. Great location, clean, comfortable bed. Easy check-in and check-out process. Parking spot is a huge plus. Tons of restaurants/bars nearby plus easy access to major highways. Lots of amenities provided."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's apartment was amazing! Exactly as the pictures. Spacious, clean, beautifully designed. The location is also great - very close to bars, restaurants, and stores. Also just a few blocks away from the epicenter of downtown Austin. Crystal was very communicative and made sure we had all the info needed to check-in and check-out without any issues. Perfect stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything exceeded expectations! The place is beautiful, stocked with anything you could possibly need, everything is modern, and the bed is very comfortable.  The best thing of all may be the neighborhood which is packed with cool stuff but in a quiet part if it.  Check in and out is a breeze.  Crystal was awesome, extremely responsive and even accommodated a late check out for us.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend this place to everyone.  "
,,,,,,,,Great place and perfect location! Host is super accommodating and whole process is easy from getting key to checking out.
,,,,,,,,This was the second time my husband and I stayed in this unit (the first time was for close to a month). It is a very comfortable space in an amazing location right downtown. The check in and check out process is super easy and Crystal is very responsive. I love this place and would definitely stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was a great host - she was prompt in answering our questions and provided a super organized and easy check in and check out process. The condo was perfectly situated downtown making walks to bars and restaurants a breeze. The condo was clean, well-stocked, and had great light with a nice view. The bed was also super comfy and the blackout shade in the bedroom made for a nice long snooze after our night out. We already recommended this place to our friends who are traveling to Austin in a few weeks. "
,,,,,,,,We had a fantastic stay at crystal's flat.  5 stars across the board. 
,,,,,,,,"This is a great and very central location. We were here for SXSW and were in the middle of the action without feeling like we were in the middle of the action. We had three coworkers sharing Crystal's place and never felt crowded. Should mention that Crystal was super responsive with questions and the instructions to get in were clear and easy. Also, there's an amazing taco truck right outside the window. A big, awesome window that overlooks the city. We loved it and look to be back next year."
,,,,,,,,The apt looks exactly like those in the pictures (very clean) - crystal was very attentive  and quick to respond to any questions. Would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"A wonderful place to stay in a really great part of town. Crystal was a great host and went out of her way to make sure the loft was easily accessible and well stocked. She is very accommodating and did a great job designing the loft with comfortable furniture and nice little touches, including records, wine and a useful live like a local binder. The location is great, putting you half way between the traditional W 6th Street party block and the locals focused E 6th neighborhood. There are B-Cycle racks all over the neighborhood, so its very easy to rent a day bike and cruise all over town. 
Highly recommended.  "
,,,,,,,,"We were in awe of the apartment when we walked in. The apartment features lots of space, modern appliances, and everything you'll need for your trip. Additionally, the apartment is situated in a perfect location for those wanting to try some of the trendiest bars and foods around. "
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I stayed for a long weekend recently. We couldn't have asked for a better location than this condo. It was fully stocked with daily necessities such as dinnerware, soap, towels, laundry detergent etc. We were within walking distance to tons of shops, restaurants, nightlife, and food trucks!! Also a convenience store and local grocery less than a block away. Crystal was a great host and let us check in early as we requested. The parking was secure and well as entry into the condo. All of the suggestions she had for food, drinks, and activities were spot on. We loved neighborhood and the small deck/ balcony. If you need a great location and fun spot to spend a long weekend or quick getaway this is your place. Would gladly come back and hope too! Last but not least there was a bottle of wine on the counter and cold beer in the fridge! 3rd visit to Austin and easily the best. Thanks for making us feel at home Crystal!"
,,,,,,,,Just like all the reviews.... Super modern and fun.  Great central spot!
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay for a single person or couple!  Crystal was an excellent host in that she replied to messages very promptly and created an easy check-in process. Would highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was a very professional host, and answered all of my questions. The place was beautiful, with a view overlooking Austin. It's the perfect location with amazing restaurants and bars within walking distance. Staying here again."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was a great host! She responded to any questions I had and gave great recommendations. The apartment is lovely, huge and nicely furnished.  This was my first time in Austin and I loved the area we stayed in; more unique then the ""west side of 6th"" with fun restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend "
,,,,,,,,"This, indeed, was an oasis. The place is even more spacious then the pictures portray and has a wonderful view of Austin. Close to everything downtown and is a stone's throw from a ton of wonderful things to do in East Austin. Also has a super comfortable bed! If all that wasn't enough, the place even came stocked with complementary beer and wine. What else can you ask for?"
,,,,,,,,"We loved Crystal's apartment. It was easy to find, the parking was great and easy to access and the apartment itself was clean, beautifully decorated and had a great view! Fantastic location also. We didn't meet Crystal but she was easy to communicate with and was very accommodating. Would definitely stay there again when we return to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"My wife & I enjoyed a great stay in Crystal's condo. It was clean, spacious, modern, and felt like a home away from home during our time in Austin.  Check-in was easy; even though we arrived early and the condo needed cleaning from the previous stay, we were able to leave our suitcases there until it was fully cleaned.  We were also able to arrange a late check-out on our departure date that enabled us to enjoy some last-minute sightseeing before flying home.

The location is very good in that it's easily walkable to all the bars on 6th Street (towards downtown) as well as all of the places in East Austin on/near East 6th.  It's also a quick and cheap Uber/Lyft ride to Rainey Street, Warehouse District, South Congress St., and some of the other places in East Austin just beyond walking distance.  It's also a quick/easy ride to the airport (approx. $15 using Uber/Lyft and about 15 min), and is right next to I-35.  

Crystal was very helpful and easy to contact throughout the entire process.  Her condo is highly recommended for either a single or couple looking for a modern loft that's conveniently located and provides many of the amenities one would find in an urban condo/loft!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was perfect when my parents came to visit Austin. The location is very central, close to everything and in a cool neighborhood with a lot to eat, drink and do. Crystal was a very accommodating host who made everything a breeze. The records and record player in the unit give the place a homey, Austin vibe. We'll definitely book this spot again! "
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The place was as described. All necessary amenities were provided, and the location was excellent. We walked most everywhere we wanted to go. There was a record player with some fun albums we enjoyed, particularly jazz, which added a nice touch. Recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's place was great and just as pictured. It's close enough to downtown, but in the hip/gentrifying East Austin area along the cooler, less touristy part of 6th Street. We loved it!

Only caveat to travelers is that the area still appears to be ""in transition"" from gritty to hipster. We didn't feel unsafe at all, but it's a bit quieter and less dense than central downtown. But we would stay again for sure."
,,,,,,,,The place was amazing. Comfy and clean. We really appreciated being near both 6th Street as well as east 6th Street which gave us options for a whole range of food and drink. We were conducting auditions and had almost 12 people stop by throughout the day. The place offered a professional and relaxing place for us to work and stay. Crystal was amazing! Attentive to our needs and requests and available at the push of a text. We will definitely stay here again in the future for work or play! 
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's place was wonderful. Perfect for my weekend get a way. Plenty of space and a 5 dollar uber to the heart of the city. Everything you need is in the location. Also, Crystal was prompt in responding to any questions I had. Thank you Crystal,  I will be back."
,,,,,,,,Crystal's place is very conveniently located. Easy to stroll down East 6th or over to dirty 6th (depending on your preference). The bed was comfortable. Crystal was a very responsive and accommodating host.  I would recommend to others. 
,,,,,,,,The place looked exactly like the listing description and photos! Crystal was quick with responses and we had a great time. Would definitely come back!
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's welcome email included all information to enter the apartment and park our car. A bottle of wine was on the counter which was a nice surprise! Crystal noticed the apartment was out of body wash so she texted to let me know that Amazon Prime would deliver it within 2 hours. She included treats for us as well for the inconvenience (it was not an inconvenience for us though :)). The apartment was very comfortable and just like the on-line summary. Great location right next to cool new places on East 6th Street (we prefer this area over West 6th Street). Crystal provided helpful local information which included Licha's and Brew & Brew, both within walking distance. We would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Lovely place
Perfect location
We had a great time
Thank you so much"
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's place was great, comfortable and easy. Awesome neighborhood close to downtown for work and the flourishing East Austin for fun. So many great bars and restaurants and food trucks within a 10min or less walk. We will be back."
,,,,,,,,"Great location!  Nice place!  Helpful host!

Will come back."
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic apartment, convenient location, and friendly host. Can't ask for more - highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,I arrived in Austin on Monday for a conference and couldn't have stayed at a better place.  The condo was exactly as described.  Crystal was extremely helpful.  The location was wonderful and close to many desirable locations.  Great way to experience Austin for the first time.
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's home does not disappoint! The photographs are 100% accurate, staying in a trendy loft space with tons of room and an outdoor patio. Some bonuses, the home comes equipped with a sound bar to play music & Hulu and Netflix to wind down the day. Crystal went above and beyond with recommendations (Brew and Brew down the street was a favorite! And there is a conveniently located, little grocery store on the corner that we stocked up at) and accommodating check in and check out times. She is an excellent communicator and always available to answering any and all questions promptly.  We felt very much at home in the condo and hated to have to leave! We will definitely be going back on our next trip to Austin to enjoy the amenities & proximity to everything in Austin (no drive was more than 10 minutes away from the condo). Thank you for such a warm, welcoming experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Magnificent locale for staying in downtown Austin.  Close to all the key interest points that one could want to hit (convention center, east 6th, dirty 6th, etc...)  The condo was very clean, plenty of room and the Bluetooth soundbar was a great touch to play some music while enjoying the view out of the ceiling to floor windows.  Crystal was very accommodating as well, was easy checking in, instructions were clear and not confusing in the least and there is a helpful booklet for guests including check in/check out instructions as well as how things in the condo work and points of interest around town.  All in all it was a great stay and I can't wait to come back again for my next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Crystal was great! She was very accommodating with early check in and the place was exactly as described online. 
,,,,,,,,Great place in a happening area!
,,,,,,,,Crystal was a great host and very helpful.  She was quick to respond to any inquiries.  The condo exceeded expectations and was very nice and clean.  Great location.  I highly recommend this condo!
,,,,,,,,Crystal was a awesome host. Quick at responding for any questions I had. The condo was exactly how it was described from the post. The taco place across from the condo is amazing and convenient. Especially from a night out on 6th street. Must try the pueblo taco! I definitely recommend this place if you have a group of 6 or less. 
,,,,,,,,Had a great time in Austin! Apartment was clean and orderly. Close walk to all the good bars and food spots
,,,,,,,,"The location and home couldn't have been better. Restaurants, bars and food trucks all within walking distance, plus easy drive or long walk to downtown. The parking spot was a huge bonus. Clean, spacious and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on too! Will definitely stay here next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal and her place were fantastic. We really enjoyed everything about our stay. The location is the best (ok, so we are former Austin East Siders and have always loved this part of town)-- but really the view and access to some great places for food and drinks really is unbeatable. Super easy access to airport and I-35. The apartment is clean and bright and very well organized. We loved the turntable and albums Crystal had there too. "
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing stay we had at Crystal's loft apartment. It's in a great location for both the madness of 6th St and the laid back vibes of east Austin. Safe off road parking, excellent wifi and an incredibly comfortable bed and sofa made it feel like a home from home. Crystal left us a welcome package which was much appreciated and the condo really does have everything you could possibly need for your stay. The photographs on the listing are 100% accurate. We can't wait to make a return visit. "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal kept in great contact with us, and her directions were so clear and helpful!"
,,,,,,,,"What can I say.. Great place, great location, great owner, great price.  The loft is easily as nice as the pictures.  Crystal left a binder with a list of dining options, things to see, etc...  There was also a complimentary 6-pack in the fridge!  We couldn't have asked for a better AirBnB experience.  I would definitely stay here again if I make it back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"What a great loft! I walked into a bottle of wine and welcome binder. The photos are an EXACT representation of loft, except they have a new, grey, fun fuzzy rug instead of the geometric rug represented. (I'm not mad at that. :)) The loft is immaculate and very comfortable. The area is up and coming (think Silver Lake, Echo Park in L.A.) and and two blocks away is a dining, cocktail paradise. If you want to be close to the action and come home to a true oasis, this wonderful loft is for you. Crystal was fantastic, great communication and just lovely to deal with. I would stay here again in an instant."
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic listing - we loved staying here. The apartment is in a great location - a block to the B-cycle Station which we used to cycle round the city and to Barton Springs. Also close to a great coffee spot, Brew & Brew which we went to once, twice a day. We would  definitely stay here again.  PS - it's also within walking distance to Franklin BBQ."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was an amazing host! We had all the information we needed to make our stay in Austin memorable and smooth. The apartment was very, stylish, clean, spacious and in a great location. I would totally book this condo with Crystal again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great condo in a great location with all the equipment you could need, right on 6th street with easy access to all parts of Austin. There is also a b cycle station one block away which makes getting around very easy.

I couldn't recommend staying here enough and Crystal is a great host. She provided us with brilliant personalised recommendations that really made our trip! 

There is a brilliant taco truck opposite the condo which did amazing breakfast tacos also!"
,,,,,,,,This is an excellent condo in a perfect location in Austin.  The natural light in the room is refreshing and the record player is a nice touch.  Crystal was very accommodating and pleasant during our communication.  I highly recommend this spot!
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful apartment in an amazing location. Happy with everything from my stay and Crystal was great, very accommodating to my late booking and very helpful. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent time in Austin and the condo was the perfect spot to come home to. Crystal was very accommodating. We arrived prior to the scheduled check in time and we were able to drop our bags off. The condo is beautiful. Modern and spacious. An excellent location as well - short walk to downtown and surrounded by amazing restaurants, shops, cafes, and bars. Thank you for an awesome stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Great condo, 2nd time staying here. So close to 6th st. and convention center. The unit has a great vibe, clean, roomy, comfortable, just a great spot. Cannot recommend highly enough. And Crystal provides free beer - you can't beat that?"
,,,,,,,,"Very responsive to inquiries, very workable with our schedule. Place was as described, fantastically accommodating, and rather conveniently located relative to the convention area. Would happily recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Cant speak highly enough of Crystal and her modern condo! Communication throughout was excellent and super quick. The decor and location of this flat was second to none - only wished we'd have stayed for longer! Will definitely stay here again if we return to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"For our first visit to Austin, Crystal has quick to respond, provide a great list of places to explore while in Austin, and answer any questions we had. The place was perfect for us, close to downtown, and in walking distance to many of the places we wanted to visit. We will definitely reach out to Crystal again the next time we're in town. "
,,,,,,,,"She provided a nice welcome package and a bottle of wine, we were so impressed how personal and helpful she was through our stay. The location was quite but still in walking distance to 6 th street and the whole down town area. from the pictures to location, she was honest and very accurate, many hotels will say they are two blocks away from attraction when in truth they are 2 miles! Perfect prime location!! "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's modern Oasis was a definite highlight to our trip to Austin. Even prior to booking this place, her communication was excellent. The views are wonderful, the bed is super comfortable, and what a great idea to leave what you can't consume for others. The location was ideal and a great starting point for our evening. Not to far from Rainey street! (If you haven't checked out bangers, do it!!) We had some friends who met us at the condo, and raved that our airbnb was definitely more appealing than theirs! We all began our walk to 5th street directly from the condo, as it sits directly across from 35 and since there were quite a few groups walking, we felt completely safe. At the end of our evening we took a motorized open cab ride, and they knew exactly where we were going. Highly recommend the location, and Crystal. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and lots of cool new places popping up around the condo. Everything was super easy and obviously planned for in advance. Loved all the natural light and the super easy commute to everything Austin. Crystal could not have been a better host!
,,,,,,,,The place was wonderful! Cool trendy spot in the perfect location! Crystal was very helpful and great to work with. Would recommend this place to anyone! Thanks again Crystal! 
,,,,,,,,"We loved the apartment! Crystal was super welcoming! She provided us with a great list of places to explore in Austin before we even got there. She was also super flexible and let us drop our stuff off at the apartment since our flight got into Austin before check in time. The apartment was amazing. It has great views and is easily accessible. Its in the perfect place, with divey East Austin on one side, and 6th street on the other. There's so much great food located close by as well. It was extremely clean, and well kept and a great place to stay while exploring Austin. It was pretty much walking distance to almost everything in Austin which was a huge plus! Thanks so much Crystal! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a really nice stay at the loft. The loft was as described and comfortable. It is walking distance to downtown, and we felt safe in the loft. Instructions were clear and there were plenty of amenities. I felt that the floors could have been a bit cleaner, since we were asked to take our shoes off. I would recommend bringing slippers so you don't have to go barefoot. "
,,,,,,,,"Would stay again and recommend to friends. Fantastic view, accessible location, and cozy. "
,,,,,,,,"This beautiful, clean, centrally located condo was a lovely choice for my first trip to Austin. I would definitely book here again! The king bed is a dream! "
,,,,,,,,"This place and Crystal were AWESOME! The apartment looks exactly as it does in the photo.   Crystal was so nice, accommodating, patient, and insightful.  When my sister and I visited, it was shortly after the floods in Austin. Crystal kept us informed the days leading up to our trip. Our flight got in pretty early Friday and Crystal allowed us to store our bags while we did some exploring before check in.  She gave us many great suggestions about what to do around the city for every type mood.  Also, the location of the apartment was so centrally located, we could walk to everything. It is close enough to 'dirty 6"" to walk but far enough to not have to deal with the foolery. Anything not in walking distance was a $5 Uber ride.  All in all, it was a great trip, a great apartment, and Crystal was a GREAT host! I will definitely book with her again!"
,,,,,,,,"We loved this loft!!!  Great space, great location, great host!  The loft was fantastic and exactly as described.  The location was perfect with an easy, quick walk to one of the most popular streets full of bars and restaurants.  

The bed was comfortable, there were some drinks provided and we really enjoyed listening to big band music on the record player.  

Not a single negative to this rental, would definitely choose to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in the modern oasis was exactly what we needed for one night in Austin. The location was perfect to get to the bars on 6th street, and the place itself was extremely clean and welcoming. The pictures are exactly what you see walking in!"
,,,,,,,,"Our first Airbnb experience was great. The location was perfect. Crystal's recommendations were excellent. The condo was modern and clean. The TV didn't work but Crystal did everything possible to get it working. When the cable company told us we would need to replace the box, Crystal credited our bill $50 and recommended local sports bars where we could watch tv. We've found a great place to stay when we travel to Austin to visit our daughter. "
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment a short walk from the convention center.  Very clean and comfortable with many thoughtful details.  Comfy bed with plenty of space and all the basics covered in the kitchen.   Check in and check out were very convenient.  Great host, great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"I loved the location, the apartment and the host! It was all great, super clean and great communication about the flat and the town. Crystal was a brilliant host!"
,,,,,,,,"Great modern apartment, right in the middle of all the fun on sixth! For about 10 blocks to the right AND left of the house the street is lined with restaurants, shops and bars. This apartment is very centrally located in the middle of all the fun....tons of stuff within walking distance!

Apartment complex is modern, gated, and comes with parking if you're driving....


The apartment itself is very modern, stylish and has a great view of the city which you can see via a wall made entirely of windows. Also a great balcony should you want to get some air.

The bedroom was comfortable and clean, with tons of closet space, extra down comforter n several extra pillows. The bed was comfty and roomy.

The bathroom and kitchen were clean and very modern. The kitchen had all the basics for cooking, which was great since we cooked quite a bit while we were there, and the dishwasher made it easy to clean up. Plenty of utensils, plateware, and kitchen necessities, including a nutribullet  which I was stoked about and an electric tea kettle.

The living room was clean, modern and comfortable, and the flat screen smart tv was great for down time. The apartment also came with a record player and comes stocked with various LPs.

The air conditioner worked perfectly, saving us from the Texas heat.

The host was friendly and helpful,  available and immediately responsive to all of our questions, and ready with recommendations too!

Would highly recommend this apartment, made it really easy to have a rad time in Austin!!!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was very communicative and welcoming before, during, and after our stay. We had some questions once we got there about parking and things like that because we had a change of plans. Crystal texted back right away so our night went smoothly even though we initially didn't think we needed a parking space. She made great recommendations for places to eat as we requested some vegetarian sorts of restaurants, and I think she probably could give great recommendations about anything in that area. We already had a packed itinerary but if you didn't know what to do or where to go, Crystal could probably give you great suggestions.
The place itself was perfect for what we wanted....close to 6th street and public transportation that we needed for our visit. We had some friends try to lure us away to another location with a nice hilltop view, but the little balcony and city view from Crystal's place was perfect for us. The decor is chic and cool, and it had all the modern conveniences we wanted most; if we had a longer stay in that area I would really recommend this place because the shower, kitchen, etc. were all awesome and you can just walk to all the hip bars and venues in the area. We really liked the suggestion to leave behind extra drinks for guests-it was a cool way to sample new things and also not waste what we couldn't get through ourselves during our short stay. We really loved our stay at Crystal's Modern Oasis and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cool condo vibe in downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal is an excellent host and the apartment is fantastic. The apartment is spacious, modern and extremely well-located. Private parking is a huge plus as well. Most importantly, the apartment was perfectly clean and well-stocked with thoughtful supplies tailored to meet the needs of travelers -- just as a high end hotel would be. Crystal herself was extremely responsive to questions. A lovely and easy place to stay -- thanks Crystal!"
,,,,,,,,"great apartment, so clean and comfortable. Really easy to get anywhere. Easy check in and out. Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,My husband and I stayed at Crystal's place while we were in town for his birthday weekend. We absolutely loved it! The location was perfect - within walking distance of pretty much anything you could possibly want. Crystal was super responsive and provided a very thorough overview of all the logistics. This was one of the smoothest stays we've had with Airbnb. Crystal is incredibly organized and we would HIGHLY recommend staying at this place if you plan to visit Austin!
,,,,,,,,"We highly recommend staying in this beautiful apartment. It was extremely well equipped, it's in a fantastic location and has nice personal touches. It was a pleasure."
,,,,,,,,Crystal's place was perfect. It looks exactly like the pictures and is in a great location. She gave great recommendations and all of her directions were super clear. I would definitely go back!
,,,,,,,,"My dad and I stayed at this apartment for several days as we toured around Austin and the surrounding area.  The location is ideal - just a short walk to Red River st. music venues and various restaurants / bars.  The place was clean, organized and easily accommodated the two of us during our stay.  The host is exceptionally nice and very helpful in making the place feel like a home away from home."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great time staying at Crystal's place for a girls weekend. The apartment was lovely and perfectly appointed, and the firm king memory foam mattress was great. Crystal is a great communicator and super helpful. The apartment is located in a great place, walking distance from just about anything you might want. Uber can take care of any longer distances! Highly recommended. :)"
,,,,,,,,"Our trip to Austin was made so much better with this great space!  Close to the 6th Street action, right off the interstate and easy to get to.  Crystal seemed to think of everything, and was very friendly to work with.   The bed (memory foam) and couch were very comfy to sleep on!

We'll definitely be staying here next year!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at the Condo! It is just as described, professionally run and clean. It was very spacious for two of us and I can see how four people wouldnâ€™t fit comfortably. Crystal provided very detailed information that made checking-in easy and makes you feel welcome. She even reached out before our stay to ask whether she could provide personalized recommendations on top of the ones in the welcome pack. The neighbourhood didnâ€™t look like much at first, but itâ€™s in a great location in East Austin and Downtown is just a short walk away. We came to Austin for a wedding and our friends had picked two locations to meet up with the out-of-towners the two nights before the actual wedding, both of which turned out to be just a 10min walk away. We would definitely stay at the condo again."
,,,,,,,,"Another wonderful experience with AirB&B.  Crystal's huge modern oasis was exactly as she described and I felt like I stayed at the apartment of a friend.  Lots of amenities and comfort; easy to get into, and the location was prime east Austin, walk-able everywhere.  Super comfortable bed!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was easy to find, the Uber driver knew exactly where the apartment complex was. Crystal gives accurate and easy directions to find her place. The place is very neat and chic. Crystal was very good as responding back to me. I needed to check in early, check out late, and also needed to have some package deliver to that address and she was very helpful in each step. I was very glad to stay at her house. The location of her house was very close to downtown. I was able to walk down the streets to experience awesome food trucks and restaurants (and also coffee & beer places). I really enjoyed staying at her place."
,,,,,,,,"I strongly recommend booking with Crystal for this property.  The location is even better than described, for example, a safe 6 block walk to Stubbs and other entertainment venues. Crystal provides helpful advice to local venues, shopping, transportation, etc.

Crystal is extremely helpful and responsive, especially to a rookie like me."
,,,,,,,,This place was nice. It's right on 6th street so easy access to everything downtown. The space is large and the alcoholic beverages provided was a nice touch after a long day of travel and work. The host was really responsive and friendly. I would stay here again in the future. 
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was an incredible host. Very accommodating and adaptable to our timeline. We needed to drop our bags before checking in and asked for a slightly later checkout. She granted both of our requests with no issues. During the weekend, she was very responsive on email and the actual condo/apartment was beautiful, clean and had a great view! Perfect location too! A+++++ Highly recommended"
,,,,,,,,"The space was fantastic - exactly as described, and walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go at SXSW 2015. 

Upon walking in, Crystal had a full welcome packet personalized to our group. Beer, wine, and snacks included!"
,,,,,,,,"Wow! Awesome space, clean, fun! more-than-centrally-located with great views ... Delete, delete, delete. I want to be able to stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is as beautiful and open and funky as it looks. I loved staying there. I was both comfortable and felt like I was in a dream home. 

Crystal is a wonderful host--responding to questions quickly and with the perfect amount of detail, checking in, and leaving lots of great recommendations.

The location was perfect for the few days I was there attending a conference at the Convention Center. It was a short walk and/or cheap Uber ride for when heading back at night.

Thanks for a great visit. It was my first time in Austin and I hope to be back."
,,,,,,,,This was a great condo for a weekend stay. Close to all the downtown fun and easy to get to. The owner was extremely helpful in her directions and got back with me usually within the hour. She even left us a bottle of wine to get our weekend started! I would recommend this place for anyone wanting to visit Austin and not deal with Austin's traffic.
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I stayed at this location for a month. The location is extraordinary, with tons of food and entertainment options in walking distance up and down 6th street. We were also right on the highway giving us quick access all over town. The best part about the unit itself was actually how comfortable the bed was! This is important when you're staying in a place for so long. Crystal was incredibly helpful and attentive during our stay and I highly recommend this place for anyone who would enjoy being at the heart of the Austin entertainment scene. "
,,,,,,,,Lovely space. Will definitely be booking next time I'm in Austin! Perfect for the mover and shaker 
,,,,,,,,"Apartment: Wonderful. It looks every bit as beautiful as it appears in the pictures. It's huge (for 2 people), clean, and very well-decorated. 
Location: The apartment is close to pretty much anywhere you would want to visit in Downtown Austin. We were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to visit in less than 30 minutes.
Host: Crystal is amazing! She provided us with personalized recommendations for to-dos in Austin, along with her self-written welcome guide that has a ton of information about the city and the condo. She is very responsive to all communication, and the check-in & check-out process could not be easier or more smooth. Since we had a late departure, we needed somewhere to keep our bags after check-out; she was very helpful in accommodating us and resolved this unique request very quickly.

If we're in Austin again, I'd definitely love to stay here again or check out another one of Crystal's properties. Thanks Crystal!"
,,,,,,,,A Wonderful Modern Oasis Indeed! We very much enjoyed our stay! Our experience started with receiving very clear and accurate instructions for check in from Crystal. The day we got there was pouring rain so it was very helpful that there was no guess work! It is great to have a parking space downtown that is reserved and off the street. We were able to walk to several of our meetings and amazing eats! The apartment is beautiful and comfortable. The kitchen had just what we needed.. inc a hot water kettle and magic bullet blender for our morning smoothie. Crystal is very responsive and helpful if you should need anything during your stay!
,,,,,,,,"This was the first place I've ever stayed that I have actually unpacked in. I felt right at home and the space looked even nicer than it did in pictures. At first glance outside, it doesn't look like there's much going on, but it's in a perfect location, right at the divide of East 6th street and 6th street bars. It's also a 15 minute walk downtown. The recommendations Crystal left were great!"
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's place is great- it was exactly what we were seeking. Clean, bright, very spacious. It's nice to have a parking spot. (That said, walking and uber are great in this neighborhood if you don't have a car). Crystal was very responsive and easy to communicate with. She also left us personalized recommendations for what to do during our stay which were very appreciated. Highly recommended!!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Crystal's apartment couldn't have been better. The spacious apartment is beautifully decorated, centrally located in walking distance of Rainey St. and East Austin, and full of helpful amenities like a washer/dryer, record player, extra toiletries, beers, and a list of nearby recommendations and attractions. I already want to plan my next trip to Asutin and would definitely repeat my exact experience at this airbnb!"
,,,,,,,,"This loft space just east of downtown near the hippest part of Austin surpassed our expectations.  The apartment itself is amazing, with a wide open kitchen, a cool and comfortable den, and an excellent view.  The bed and bath are quite comfortable and well appointed.  The pay it forward concept provided us some good local beers and spirits, and we were happy to restock.  The location is excellent; we were able to walk out and find a good cup of coffee early on Christmas Day.  Crystal was responsive and a wonderful host.  We hope to come back."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was great.  The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated with high quality linens.  The location was perfect.  Walking distance to downtown and even closer to a ton of cool bars, restaurants and food trucks on E 6th.  I would highly recommend this apt/host to anyone and would happily stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was great, she provided a great place to stay and lots of info for what's hip in the area.  We loved the location, as it's near everything you wan to do and see in Austin.  Right on 6th street 2 blocks away from the nightlife.  Also the funky eastside is right at your doorstep, great Mex and BBQ right across the street.  B-Cycle station 1 block away. Great tortilla stir next door and a fun wine tasting place right behind you.  Parking was great and simple.  A really cool place to stay with mod setting, also it was so nice that there was cold beer in the fridge.  Thanks Cyrstal you make Austin Rock!  "
,,,,,,,,"My 3 friends and I only stayed for one night and it rained a lot but we couldn't have asked for a better staying situation that Crystal's loft. The place is located very centrally and the surrounding area was safe and clean. We were within walking distance from the downtown area which was very convenient. The loft was clean and a lot of extra goodies (food and drinks) were available for us. Crystal was a great host and was easily available to assist with any issues, which we didn't have at all! Will definitely stay longer next time!"
,,,,,,,,Very satisfied with our stay! Crystal was very helpful and great with communication throughout our trip. Def recommend and looking forward to coming back ! 
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful apt; great location, will definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"A brilliant place to call base. Large and spacious with all the facilities you would need. It is a 5 minute Uber to just about anywhere ($5 ride) and is perfect for friends, couples and probably ideal for business trips too. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was spectacular. I would definitely stay again. It's as beautiful as the pictures. The only thing to be prepared for is that it's a little loud, but nothing that cannot be taken care of by some ear plugs. And the location is awesome close to some great new restaurants and bars. But it's a neighborhood in transition so there are some elements that can be a little unsavory. But there is a great security system and no one bothered me at all. It's just something to be aware of before you book. And Crystal was a great hostess! She even brought me a key after I lost one. And the place is well stocked for guests. "
,,,,,,,,"Our group was 4 ladies in their late 20's staying here for the WVU vs Texas game. It was our first time in Austin and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The location was great, walking distances to lots of bars and restaurants. We loved the condo! It was very spacious, clean, and modern. A very nice bonus was the 'pay it forward' system in which beer, wine, liquor, and food were left and available by past guests, as we also left anything unused for future guests. Our host was wonderful as well! She was readily available before and during our stay. She provided a list of things to do in the area for people staying in at the property and also made a personalized one for our group. It was great having a washer and dryer, full kitchen, balcony, and a large living area we could keep an air mattress set up in during our stay with plenty of room for hanging out still. We also had fun with the record player in the condo! We would 100% stay here on our next visit to Austin! Thanks for everything!! "
,,,,,,,,"A perfect location to enjoy downtown Austin. Nested between 6th St and the up and coming E 7th area. Everything is walking distance. Noise level can be a bit high but should be expected for this type of vibrant location. Host is friendly, pro-active and left plenty of recommendations. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"I highly recommend this property/host to anyone traveling to Austin.  It had every amenity promised, was very clean, and the host went out of her away to ensure a great experience for me (the restaurant/activity recommendations she made based on what i was looking for was a great touch!).

The location is ideal -- walking distance from the bar scene on 6th St, but far enough away to avoid the craziness that comes with it.
I 100% would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great night at Crystal's place. Austin is a lot of fun, and the apartment was convenient to what we were interested in. And when we returned for the night, it was a perfect place to spin a few records and relax! I recommend The Oasis to anyone visiting. It's clean, comfortable and stylish. Crystals's instructions were simple and clear. "
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed Crystal's condo, it was very well priced, perfect location, and she was very accommodating.   I would highly recommend this place to stay if you come to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Overall, this is a great place. The location is very close to 6th st bars and the apartment is very cool, clean, and well decorated.

Unfortunately, two smoke detectors required servicing during two nights, which required setting up a ladder in the middle of the night. Also, the hot water heater breaker was flipped off without our knowledge, and we didn't have hot water one day.

Crystal was very responsive with all our issues (within minutes, usually). Nevertheless, these issues did detract from our otherwise pleasant stay."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was absolutely perfect, and Crystal was very hospitable. Loved her vinyl collection too. Would definitely rent again. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was ready as described at Modern Oasis in Downtown.  Location was great too - close to amenities, but not so much in the thick of things that you couldn't relax.  Space was airy, open, very comfortable and clean.  Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,This was my first experience using airbnb and it was amazing. I definitely will use it again. Crystal's place was simple and just what was needed for anyone visiting the Austin area. Good location.. 10 out of 10. 
,,,,,,,,"Crystal's place is even better than the pictures. Roomy, yet cozy it provided my husband and I with a perfect spot to explore 6th st and downtown Austin on foot. Loved the decor, bed and couch are very comfy and in general this is a great place. Crystal is also a terrific host, she ave us tips of things to do, place to eat. Protip: There's  a taco stand across the street and they're available for breakfast tacos and late night munchis. "
,,,,,,,,"I had such a great time at the condo! 

It was well put together decorated nicely. All appliances working perfectly and I felt very comfortable . I would love to come back and stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"The host made me feel very welcome, when I had trouble getting in the gate, her assistant raced right done to help me (and it was my own damn fault for not noting that there were two gates!). The place was clean, wonderfully decorated, had everything I needed and was a pleasure to stay in. Close to convention center and Sixth St., very happy with location. Nice booklet about procedures (check out, local hot spots, etc.). Cannot recommend more highly."
,,,,,,,,I drove to Austin for a work convention so the fact that my car was inside a gated community with limited access was an absolute awesome feature.  The condo itself was very cool and although I didn't stay in it much I still enjoyed coming back to it after a long day.  I walked to 6th street and back which was great because I didn't have to worry about parking or paying a taxi for such a short drive.  I have to come to Austin at least once a year and I hope her condo is available each time from here on!
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying here. It's a very stylish place. The personal recommendations were great, as well as the location and everything about the apartment. Crystal was a great host and always responded very quickly. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. There was a minor a/c problem the host were very kind and accommodating as well as extremely expedient in correcting the problem. The location is great. The condo has everything you need and more. I will definitely return and recommend to another others.
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was an amazing host and her apartment is phenomenal!  She really made us feel at home by leaving us personalized recommendations on things we might want to do on our weekend in Austin.  Her restaurant/bar/activities suggestions were great, and we definitely saw parts of Austin that we never would have discovered on our own.  She was also really helpful with check-in and check-out and made the entire process seamless.

I really don't think you could find a nicer apartment in Austin.  It's walking distance to basically anywhere you'd want to go (east 6th, dirty 6th, campus, Congress bridge), and the apartment itself is gorgeous.  I loved the clean and modern feel, and the floor to ceiling windows provide a good view of the city.  If I'm ever back in Austin, I'll definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Beautiful place. Clean and comfortable. Incredibly smooth transaction and excellent hosts!
,,,,,,,,"First, let me say this was our first visit to Austin. We really had no idea what to do, where to go, or how to get there. Crystal went above and beyond to provide us with tailored information about restaurants, nightlife, outdoor activities, and more. In addition to her nifty welcome packet, Crystal was proactive in her communication and made us feel at ease about our upcoming trip. Moreover, she was flexible with our arrival and departure times. 

The condo itself was fantastic. We arrived a bit later than anticipated, but when we got there, the record player was on with a Frank Sinatra set playing for us. There was more than enough space for the 2 of us and had everything we needed for our stay, including a super comfy bed and trendy modern decor to boot! 

The condo is located just a couple blocks away from the 6th street action and East Austin and within walking distance of the downtown area and Rainey Street. While we did take Ubers/Lyfts to some places (South Congress, Barton Springs), that is to be expected. Overall, I'd say Austin is pretty walkable. 

I would definitely recommend Crystal's condo, especially to Austin newcomers. Thanks again for a great trip!"
,,,,,,,,"The location, space and the host were both fantastic. The location was great - quiet, convenient, etc. Crystal was very nice and courteous and considerate. She provides personalized recommendations based on what I told her we were interested and we got to try many of them. The condo itself was very clean and comfortable. I will definitely look into staying here again next time I am in Austin and would certainly recommend it to others. "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome experience, as always! Clean, had some snacks ready, plenty of booze."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal is an amazing host. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and is in a great location. We had a great time and would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking to have fun in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Our stay at Crystal's Place was simply perfect. Crystal was quick to respond to our questions and gave us great recommendations. The apartment was clean as could be and very comfortable for all four of us.  We loved the location and would definitely stay here again :)  
,,,,,,,,This was a very pleasant experience. The apartment was great and the location could not be better. Just a few minutes walk from 6th street but nice and quiet when you want to get away from the commotion. Crystal was an excellent host and check in/out was very smooth. She really made an effort to make us feel welcome and enjoy the city. I would definitely recommend this others.  
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was great. She provided us with all of the information we needed before we arrived for our vacation. The apartment was great. The location was great. The place was very nice and clean! Crystal provided a binder with tons of information about Austin. She was very helpful! We would stay here again. My boys are still talking about the views and that record player. 

"
,,,,,,,,I have nothing but positive things to say about this airbnb experience.  The   residence was even better than pictured.  Very modern and spacious.  There are multiple bars/restaurants in the area as well as great coffee shops all within walking distance.  The host was extremely helpful with recommendations and checked in with us throughout our stay.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was an amazing host. The whole process was very simple and her instructions were easy to follow. From the moment we parked the car and poured a drink, it took less than 5 minutes. 

Her place is very spacious and well decorated. We were able to sleep four comfortably (2 on a bed, 1 on blow up mattress and another on the couch). Her location is also close to everything, it takes about a 10 minute walk to the bars/restaurants on 6th street and about 20-30 minutes to congress bridge.

Lastly, the best surprise was her ""Pay it Forward"" program where previous guests leave any extra alcohol for the next guests. After helping ourselves to some vodka, bourbon, and beer, we gladly went to the liquor store next door to restock the supplies.

For the price, location, host, and decorations, I give it 5 stars.

Great place for my first time using airbnb, will definitely stay in the same spot next time I'm in austin."
,,,,,,,,"First off, the place is great. Modern, clean, and in a great location. What made it different from other places I've stayed at through airbnb is Crystal's personal touch in the stay. She was incredibly responsive, gave great suggestions on places to check out (we went to all 3 of her just-for-us recommendations (which were compiled and printed out just for use before we arrived) and had a wonderful time), and seemed to have a genuine interest in wanting us to have a good experience in Austin. 

We were there for a conference at the convention center, and the walk there was quick and manageable. A great place to say. "
,,,,,,,,"We booked this for our client who was visiting our office in Austin. Crystal was fabulous to work with, she made everything easy. Our client was able to check in with ease and had everything she needed for her stay. The location is super nice to be within walking distance of great places to eat. The bed was super comfy and our client asked if we could make sure she stays here next time she is in town! "
,,,,,,,,"Chrystal was very accommodating, friendly and super easy to contact. The apartment is quirky and had everything we were looking for, including the location for all of the night life action. Will definitely recommend for future visitors to Austin!!! "
,,,,,,,,"We love this place & our clients love to stay here. Easy walking distance to most everything downtown. Way better then a hotel, our client loved the washer & dryer and going home with clean clothes. The beverages in the fridge are a super nice touch. Thanks for another fabulous stay!"
,,,,,,,,Crystal was very easy to work with and a great host overall.
,,,,,,,,"What our business client had to say about this awesome Downtown Condo we booked for her when she came to Austin : Not only is this condo very well decorated (you can tell the owner put thought into the design) but it is HUGE! The king size bed is the most comfortable bed I have slept on. The view from the living room is beautiful. The kitchen is really cool and the fridge was stocked with some beer and wine (very thoughtful). There's a washer, dryer & laundry soap to get your laundry done. I stayed for a week and did not hear any street noise and slept very well. The condo is also in a super convenient area. You're on 6th street and it's a short walk downtown (maybe 5 minutes). I had no issues walking around at night to the food trucks and downtown. I will definitely book this condo again for my future trips to Austin. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was absolutely amazing.  Within walking distance from everything.  Located on 6th street.  The aesthetics of the property and unit were very well kept.  This unit is a must of you want to be anywhere near 6th street.  
,,,,,,,,"Great spot for a new/small family - our first stay with an airB stay.  Close to downtown and not far from lots of good eats on the east side.  Great large windows to see traffic on I-35, a bit of city noise, but not enough to bother sleep."
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was a great host, super responsive and provided a great list of recommendations in the area to check out during my stay.  Apartment was in a great location, easy walking distance to East 6th."
13485075,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Such a wonderful place to stay if you are visiting Austin! Centrally located to all the best spots in Austin and right next to UT.  Esther was super accommodating and the apartment exceeded our expectations.
,,,,,,,,"The was was very helpful in getting me situated in Austin. The property was as described and spotless clean. The neighborhood is nothing fancy, but I felt safe enough making the walk from downtown late at night."
,,,,,,,,Esther and her place were great! Location is right by UT Austin. Esther is great at communicating. Would stay there again!

,,,,,,,,Very nice apartment! My jaw was dropping the whole time. Very comfortable bed and easy to find apartment.
5123097,,8,10,10,10,8,10,Will was an absolutely phenomenal host - it's even the second time we've worked with him during SXSW and he was a great collaborator and responsive throughout. An ideal spot for a stay for any of the events and festivals in downtown Austin.
8626202,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"The pictures don't properly portray the apartment! It really looks like Dustin put in the effort to make the place really comfortable and inviting. The record player is such a nice touch. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom actually has good lighting and the apartment isn't terribly far from the nightlife of 6th. Would most definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"Apartment is as described / shown and was tidy, well prepared and had some cool vinyl to boot. Dustin is super nice, helpful and seems pretty f'n cool, so much so that I told him if he ever comes to Oz to look me up and my gf up and I will show him around. If you go to Austin stay here for sure. "
,,,,,,,,"Dustin was very accommodating for our stay for ACL. Drove multiple groups down to the park, left clean towels, shampoo, toothbrushes and offered to bring anything else we needed. Location could not be more perfect as well, would definitely stay here again, especially for ACL"
,,,,,,,,"This place was exactly as described, clean, homey and simple. Epic location, close to everything. Amazing cafe's within walking distance! Also loved the personal touches of beverages in fridge and extra toothbrushes/soaps in the bathroom. Communication was clear & flexible check in/out times was nice. Dustin is ""good people""! Would stay here again for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"The house is much nicer than picture! And it was actually bigger than I expected too. It was warm, clean and artistic! You are going to love the experience in this house :) "
,,,,,,,,"Dustin was an excellent host, and his Clarksville apartment is a perfect place to stay if exploring Austin. The apartment was clean and welcoming and the check in process was completely painless and easy. Dustin even had drinks for us in the fridge and a great record collection :) The bed was super comfy as well! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a spot in Austin. Clarksville is a great neighborhood as well. "
,,,,,,,,"This was an awesome apartment. It was clean, well decorated, and homey. The neighborhood was great, too! A nice walk to downtown, with lots of restaurants and things to do nearby. A very cool spot! "
,,,,,,,,"Convenient, clean, and comfortable. Perfect space for two. The bed was really comfortable. We loved playing records while hanging out at the apt."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect! Clean, spacious, quiet & super cute. In my experience there is no such thing as a quiet apartment, let alone a quiet apartment minutes from downtown. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find out Dustin's apartment was absolutely peaceful. The only thing I could hear was the episode of Workaholics my boyfriend and I watched on the awesome tv. We had a great experience, I highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome -- in the perfect location that was easy to get to everything with cute shops & restaurants & bars within walking distance. Check-in & out was a breeze; Dustin was easy to get a hold of when needed and was a great host. The apartment itself was super clean, well-decorated & stocked with everything one might need on a vacation, including a great record collection. Would 100% recommend to anyone coming into Austin to stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was amazing. Great house, a nice walk to the center and everything you need is around. Dustin is a great host and takes care of every detail. Highly recommended it to anyone who wants to spend a few days in austin!"
,,,,,,,,Good location. Easy checkin and checkout. 
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was exactly as described - the Clarksville area is great with a coffee shop, diner and grocer all within walking distance.  Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying here. The apartment is immaculate and filled with retro charm. The location is super convenient and in one of Austin's best neighbourhoods. Dustin was an accomodating host, and everything ran super smooth. I hope to stay here again one day!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was as described. Great location. Enjoyed the stay and would definitely stay there again.

,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was great and the apartment itself felt like a hidden retreat. We had a great time. Dustin made our arrival easy; the apartment was clean, comfortable, and exactly as pictured. Would highly recommend this Airbnb to others!"
,,,,,,,,Great clean space with everything as described. I really enjoyed staying here even for just one night. Thanks Dustin for making my first AirBnb experience awesome. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Walking distance to everything you could need! The apartment has a few funny quirks due to the age of the building, (for example my boyfriend and I are both on the tall side and the shower head is only about 5 feet off the ground) but overall we really enjoyed our stay. Comfy bed, very clean, loved the decor and the location is prime!!"
,,,,,,,,"Super cute, awesome place, great location!"
7241797,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Had a fantastic weekend st the Zilker Park Austin home!  Very nice and updated with the latest and greatest.  Crazy fast internet, which was awesome!!  Would definitely stay here again."
15843359,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Rachel is a great host, and her place was comfortable and convenient to everything on the east side as well as downtown Austin.  Would recommend to anyone.  

"
,,,,,,,,Really nice neighborhood with good restaurants in walking distance. Good fun to watch all the people line up early mornings for the BBQ place to open.
,,,,,,,,"Rachel was such a sweetheart, and I felt so comfortable staying at her home. Her house is super cute, incredibly (like, seriously) clean, and really comfortable to be in. Franklin's BBQ is across the street, and so it was fun to sit on the porch and have breakfast and watch people line up so early in the morning. The bedroom is in the back of the house, and so there's almost no noise at all. The pictures are true to what the house actually looks like, and the bed was really comfortable. Its super walkable to nightlife, and there's some great restaurants within a 3 minute walk. Also, I had business to do downtown and in the capital, and easily got both a car2go in her neighborhood and the various uber alternatives that there are in Austin. 

Overall, I would highly recommend staying here to anyone! Thanks again, Rachel! "
2423840,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"As advertised! A well-appointed house on a quiet street blocks from 6th & Lamar and a 30 minute walk to ACL. Tons of square footage inside, a nice kitchen with all the tools one might want, great master combo with a lesser guest bed and bath shared with an air mattress option in the office.

Jess and Jonathan were easy to work with, truly opened up their home to us and had all the info we needed . . great hosts."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great communication, great home! Couldn't have asked for more! "
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay and Jess and Jonathan's house. It was in the perfect location tucked away behind 6th street. The house itself was large enough to accommodate 6 of us and very cozy. Jess was prompt with her responses and provided us with great recommendations for restaurants in the area. 
,,,,,,,,"We came to Austin for ACL and Jess' house was great and perfect for our needs.  The house is really nice, clean and spacious, way more than enough to accommodate the five of us.   The neighborhood is great as well, located near some of the bars/restaurants on west 6th street and a short walk to Zilker park, so getting to the concert was not an issue at all. Jess and her husband were amazing hosts, very responsive and always communicating with us.  They even left a nice bottle of wine for us to enjoy! I totally recommend their place and would love to stay here for future Austin trips. "
,,,,,,,,"We had an absolutely lovely time at Jess and Jonathan's house. The house fulfilled all our expectations. The back garden was super cute, and a lovely place to rest after a busy day.
Both bedrooms are spacious, and they put up a blow up bed in the office for the third person.
Big bathrooms, lovely kitchen, bikes available for us to useâ€¦. all in all a great stay. I warmly recommend anyone to stay here. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Jess and Jonathan were phenomenal hosts- communicative, punctual, and gave us all the information, assistance and availability we needed to have an incredible Thanksgiving holiday for the whole family in Austin! A+ for the hosts!

The space was impecable- clean, creative, spacious and so homey. We felt immediately at home, and the trinkets, paintings and decorations around the house are beautiful and fascinating. They have put so much thought and creativity into every detail of their home, and it was such a pleasure to stay there. Beds were comfortable, showers and baths were perfect, with great water pressure, the kitchen was the ideal place to host our Thanksgiving dinner (large dining table and kitchen), and the living room was a great gathering space to play games and get together.  A+ on the space!

Location- you really cannot ask for a better location in Austin. As Austin residents, we know the city well, and their home is in walking distance to everything- town lake, whole foods, coffee shops, shopping, ACL's Moody Theater, you name it! That said, Clarksville (where the house is) is a lovely, quiet neighborhoood, so you get the best of both worlds- Austin city charm and neighborhood safety and quietness. 

All in all was a great and memorable experiene, and mae our Thanksgiving holiday that much better. Thanks Jess and Jonathan!"
,,,,,,,,Jess and Jon were very hospitable and quite easy to work with and the house is as advertised.  What doesn't come through in the listing is that the place is spotless and very comfortable.  We looked forward to coming back from COTA each day and recharging ourselves.  This will be our first choice for lodging when we return in future years.
,,,,,,,,"Jess and Jonathan provided a beautiful house for our group to stay in. They made us feel welcome from the get go to say the very least. The house has absolutely everything you need and is in a perfect location so that you can get anywhere very quickly. We were in town for ACL and could not ask for a better spot.

We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and hospitality that went through the roof. I can confidently say that I will for sure be back when I come to Austin again.

Thank you Jess and Jonathan for an unforgettable weekend!

Cheers!"
5126182,,10,10,10,10,10,10,We came for ACL and Katie was awesome.  This was my first AirBnB and to say I was hesitant is an understatement.  The home is beautiful and clean and was walking distance to the park.  They were towing cars and Katie texted to make sure we had a car with a pass and to warn us of the towing.  Everything was A+ and would definitely recommend Katie and her lovely home to anyone.
,,,,,,,,"My company and I stayed here during SXSW, and Iâ€™m so happy we did.  We had open communication with the host during the entire process- from booking to leaving. We arrived with the place stocked of food and drinks, and the place was spotless and decorated (modern). Most of all, it was great to have a place to come back from the crazy world of SXSW. It was comfortable, safe, and only a 15-20 minute walk (6 minutes by car) from all the action. So whenever we needed a break, weâ€™d walk back and get to relax for a bit. It was great having that escape. I would (and probably will next year) stay here again. It was worth every penny."

,,,,,,,,Great condo with prefect location. Had everything one could want on a quick trip to Austin! Would 200% recommend 
,,,,,,,,The apartment is super closed to downtown and we can walk to the 6th street within 10 minutes. The place is stylish and comfortable. The host gave us a really detailed and helpful manual. I will recommend the apartment to my friends.
,,,,,,,,Everything was amazing. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Super nice clean place.
,,,,,,,,Great hosts! Very informative and great detail left or what to do around the city and how to access the condo. Everything was exactly they way they said it would be. 
,,,,,,,,great details on how to check in/out...and location was fantastic. only disappointing piece was the 3rd floor (and no elevator piece)--just due to an elderly guest I was traveling with. 
,,,,,,,,This place was in a perfect location. Walking distance to night life but still far enough away to where its not noisy. The manual that was sent made the check in process and operation of how everything worked very easy. There was never a need to contact the host. The apartment was very clean and i would definitely stay here again 
,,,,,,,,Twas a good place for a good time
,,,,,,,,What a great location and such a cute apartment. Around the block from the Convention Center and several eateries and places to grab a drink and relax. The apartment is comfortable and clean with all the necessary amenities. We would definitely stay here again.  Thanks!
,,,,,,,,Everything was exactly as described! Perfect for a quick overnight stay with easy walking to restaurants and bars! Very quick response and easy check-in
,,,,,,,,"The host had great communication, making sure we knew how to get to the unit and giving us his contact info in case there were any problems."
,,,,,,,,"The location is perfect for the convention center and 6th street festivities.  The walls are a bit thin, so if you are a light sleeper it might not be for you as you can hear the noise from 6th street.  Overall, a comfortable place in a great location."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, walkable to everything in downtown, nice to have a parking space. "
,,,,,,,,Great location..had some technical issues but hosts were very accomadating.  Thanks

,,,,,,,,Brad was a great host. He makes you feel welcome. His place is cozy and is close to many places.
,,,,,,,,Brad was a great host who was easy to contact and communicate with. His apartment was clean and in a great location. I would highly recommend staying here.
,,,,,,,,Place was very cute! Brad and his team was awesome with helping me with my last minute booking... I would love to stay here again 
,,,,,,,,Great stay and close access to the convention center. Unit was clean and close to great restaurants. Brad provided great information on desirable spots close to the condo and was easily contracted. 
,,,,,,,,"Brad was super helpful and responsive, and gave me great tips for Austin. The listing was clean and comfortable, and located in a great central spot (heart of downtown, 2 blocks from 6th street)."
,,,,,,,,Brads apartment was nice. Brad was freindly and allowed us to check out a little later in the day.

,,,,,,,,"Very zen and mellow vibe. Loved the books everywhere, cozy and comfortable beds. Walkable to most everywhere. A nice place to chill."

,,,,,,,,"Staying here was very convenient and easy. While I never met the host due to our travel times, they were always very responsive and had great suggestions on things to do/places to go/places to eat! It's a very convenient location and worked out very well for our trip!"
,,,,,,,,I had a great experience at this Airbnb. The host was incredibly attentive and accommodating. I would definitely book again and recommend to anyone who is looking to visit the downtown/SoCo area!
,,,,,,,,"Our host was quick to respond and great about communicating both ahead of our trip and during it. Any questions I posed were quickly and completely answered. The space itself is great - large living / dining area with two very well maintained bedrooms (and some awesome bookshelves throughout), a full kitchen, and bathroom.

The entire place was very clean and is a short walk from Zilker Park and Downtown Austin (20mins or so to each)."
,,,,,,,,"Seth was very responsive and easy to get in touch with. He also made some great suggestions on where to eat, i.e. Elizabeth Street Cafe for breakfast (delicious)! The location was great, convenient, and safe. It was an easy walk to Rainey Street, downtown, and over to Jo's coffee on South Congress. Also, we had three separate vehicles and the apartment complex didn't have any assigned parking which was also a plus because we were able to keep all vehicles parked there at the same time. There are two beds, but there is plenty of room for a blow up mattress (or two) and the couch could easily sleep two as well. I would recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,"Peaceful Bouldin Apt - Walk DT was in the perfect location. Super close to many great places and totally walkable if not for the humidity and heat! It's a little hard to find at first but easy enough to get to. The host was very friendly and brought us bug spray when we found mosquitos flying around. They were very flexible with check-in and out times, which we totally appreciated considering our flight out was in the evening. If you're looking at a place to sleep at and not spend too much time at, this is in the ideal spot. The bathroom could use some scrubbing, but I think that's just the age of the tub."
,,,,,,,,Great job with communication and overall experience. Location was perfect for us and the wifi was excellent.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in a large apartment complex with multiple buildings (that was not clearly stated in the listing). But it was a nice complex with plenty of parking on the premises, which was convenient. We parked two rental cars. The location was also very convenient - extremely close to Congress Ave and walkable/a short drive to 6th street, Rainey District, etc. There are multiple spare keys available, which was helpful when traveling with another couple. The living area is very spacious and the kitchen is stocked with essentials. Overall, it's not the cleanest place - cat litter smell, cat hair, pilled sheets, damaged tub and mildew smelling shower curtain. But besides the cleanliness it was a good place to stay. I never was told the owner's name, but he was very helpful and offered great advice about Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice place , loved the decor and the collection of books there . Perfect for short stays . "
,,,,,,,,Seth was a kind and responsive host! The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of space in the apartment. 
,,,,,,,,"Very communicative and flexible. Quiet area, the apt is exactly as described."
,,,,,,,,"Our host was very welcoming and responsive thoughout our trip.   The aprtment was in a wonderful location walking distance to downtown, parks and SoCo.  We loved how dog friendly the property and surrounding locations were.  The aprtment is cute but is mainly for sleeping.  The bathroom leaves a lot to be desired and could use a good cleaning and tub/shower repairs.  We love being so close to everything."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exactly as advertised, and was a great place to stay for our 4 night trip! The host was very responsive and accommodated an earlier check in time for us at short notice. Definitely recommend to anyone staying in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"On the positive side, our host was very accommodating. Communication was great. Location is good... downtown area Austin. Walking distance to restaurants, etc...

Areas in need of  improvement: apartment was not very nice. Messy cabinets, drawers and pantry. Tub was stained, giving it the appearance of being dirty. Missing standard appliances I believe every AirBnB should have: t.v., microwave, toaster, coffee pot."
,,,,,,,,"The host was very welcoming and checked in to make sure everything was ok. He was accommodating and flexible with the checkout time. 

The neighborhood could not be better. Centrally located to most everything you need in Austin. The apartment had character and a definite sense of style. It could use a good cleaning, it felt a little dingy and the shower definitely necessitated flip flops. 

All in all, though, great for our purposes!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience. The host was awesome, the place was awesome, the location was awesome, the view was awesome. I would definitely stay there again. No issues here!"
,,,,,,,,Walking distance from downtown. Neat 2 bedroom apartment. 
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful Bouldin Creek and it's host, Seth, did a great job hosting us BBQ maniacs. Tranquil vibes abound and it's proximity to nature and vice was exactly what we needed. Seth was communicative, easy to work with, and everything was exactly as described. Thanks for opening your door to us! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location -- easy to walk to everywhere you'd want to go.  Minimalist space, and clean. "
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was lovely - very clean, quiet, and relaxing. Perfect for my business trip because it was only a short walk to downtown with convenient check-in and check-out. The bed was also extremely comfortable, which can make all the difference in a place to stay. Though everything was great, my favorite part was the beautiful view from the back balcony of the creek :) "
,,,,,,,,"This home is very thoughtfully decorated in the style of a meditation studio, and is quite well-maintained. We (a party of four) were in Austin for a four-day conference, and were happy to be so conveniently located in town. The apartment and common area was a nice retreat after long days of panels, and provided a comfy atmosphere to stay in on rainy nights. And if you're looking for good reading, the bedroom wall is overflowing with interesting recommendations."
,,,,,,,, The listing was exactly what we were looking for. It was spacious and the apartment was had a nice rustic and natural feel. The host made us feel welcomed and provided everything we needed for a quick weekend stay in Austin for SXSW. We were close enough that we were able to walk to nearby locations and we were extremely pleased with our stay.

,,,,,,,,Chereen's loft was perfectly prepared and the check-in/out could not have been easier. Communication was perfect and always available. I can't wait to come back to Austin and stay with Top Trip.
,,,,,,,,Amazing stay! Perfect location!

,,,,,,,,"Great location for 6th Street music. Very clean, spacious, lots of light, goo amenities.
Communicative host, readily available to ensure we had a great home away from home.
Will re-visit when I can get away from work next."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location! Walking distance to so many great spots (6th and even Rainey). Convenient keyless entry and a modern building. Decorated very nicely. It fit our group of 6 adults easily. Beautiful views on 3 balconies (overlooking the Driskill hotel too). Would stay here again and recommend to anyone.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location within walking distance to everything.  Not too much noise from 6th street. Great place for a group! Also really appreciated the quick responses from host & snacks, etc. provided on arrival. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay for business or vacation. Super close to the convention center and out the door is 6th St. Chereen and her staff were super to work with. Very accommodating, friendly and available when needed. We can highly recommend this place. "
,,,,,,,,"Overall I am giving TopTrips a 3 star rating. Okay, but with a few things to improve.

When I initially requested to book this unit I was contacted by the host with a list of questions about what I would be doing in the condo and on my vacation, with an emphasis on partying not being tolerated, understandable as a destroyed condo can not be rented but annoying in that my vacation should be my business. After I asked for clarification as to what their definition of ""partying"" was in order to avoid any misunderstanding, instead of getting a response, TopTrips allowed my request to laps, costing me a booking fee. I would have chosen another place to stay if the agent hadn't contacted me and seemed genuinely apologetics. After resubmitting my request, costing me an additional Airbnb booking fee, I booked the condo. Once I had booked, I expressed the possibility that I might be renting a car for my trip. A form was sent to me for a parking space at $100 for the week (a great deal in Austin). It was the week leading up to my trip that things really started to show negatives. An agent emailed me with ""It looks like mentioned possibly having a car but I DON'T BELIEVE WE RECEIVED A CREDIT CARD AUTHORIZATION FORM BACK TO PROVIDE A PARKING PASS"". I was amazed at the unprofessionalism. I understand the need of a business to be paid for services, but the wording of ""credit card authorization form"" instead of something like ""will you still be needing this service"" really annoyed me. This was followed by an email asking when I would be arriving and leaving, my arrival time and departure time already being in the rental agreement. The final strike was coming into the condo and finding the furnishing completely different from what was shown in the images. When I called an agent she informed me that the condo had been remodeled and then tried to give me a pitch as to why this was better. From a company that wanted to know every detail of my trip the fact that the condo had been remodeled and refurnished was a major thing to neglect to tell me. After that there were little things like only having 1 trashbag and 1 trashcan in the condo (none in either bathrooms) and 2 rolls of toilet paper in total, to be used by 8 people for a week.

Overall it was an alright place to stay, although definitely ""lived in"". Next time I'm in town I will be getting a hotel. Even if it costs me more I'll be safe in knowing that they will handle their business with a little more professionalism, and what I see on the site is what I will get."
,,,,,,,,Ideal location if you are wanting to experience the music and bars of 6th St. We were warned about possible noise from the bars but it was fine. The apartment is very comfortable and the beds were great (5 beds for 5 single guys).
,,,,,,,,"I'll start by saying that we had a fantastic time staying with TopTrip rentals in Austin. Seven of my high school buddies and I decided to stage a small reunion in Austin for a weekend. Now, I should mention that we didn't actually stay in the particular unit under which this review is posted, as it was undergoing renovations at the time. The hosts accidentally let us book it, but notified us before we arrived of the error. They very efficiently transferred us to a new apartment in the same building and, quite generously, gave us a second apartment on the same floor as recompense for the mixup (at no extra charge I might add). Basically, the hosts turned what could've been quite a hassle into a blessing, as the 7 of us were much more comfortable in two apartments instead of squeezing into just one. For that I am very grateful. Everything else was pretty much as great as advertised. The apartments were nice. All key-code entry made it super easy for people to come and go as they pleased without having to keep track of keys. For a group of people looking to hit the town the location is perfect! You really can't get much closer to the 6th street revelry. If you try, you can hear the bars from the apartments. If you're a light sleeper, there are complimentary earplugs, but hey, the biggest draw of staying here (IMO) is that you can walk right out the door and join the fun. That's what we did!"
,,,,,,,,The view of downtown was amazing  & right across the street from sxsw festivities. Due to construction the up stairs balcony has plywood covering the Brazos street view & not very pleasant. Other than that it's what you would expect. 
,,,,,,,,Right on lively 6th Street. Make sure you don't mind listening to blues guitar until 2:00a if you decide to stay here. The place was exactly as advertised and the rental people were easily accessible for questions. 
,,,,,,,,"They were really accommodating and helpful... they allowed us to check in early and responded to emails promptly.  This company is super reliable and easy to work.  
As for the location it was really perfect downtown location.  It is really loud from the music on 6th but the provide plenty of earplugs.  
Thank you"
,,,,,,,,"It was easy to get hold of someone at Top Trip to answer questions. My only feedback I didn't like was when I called regarding the cable TV down in the main living room, I was told to reset it and it would work. It didn't and no one came to check it out. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment, but it would have been nice to have access it during the stay. The cable in the bedroom was working well. "

,,,,,,,,Easy to find in downtown Austin. Very chic and comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,Lovely place in a great neighbourhood. We drove everywhere so I can't comment on walkability to nearby attractions. Alexandria was a wonderful host who made us feel very welcome and even left us a lovely bottle of red wine to enjoy! Very thoughtful. I would throughly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"Host was not overbearing in the slightest! Super sweet and attentive prior to arrival. She accommodated us early becaus wwe had such an early flight. She really was great! She even helped me find a few near by cycling studios! The only down side is that Austin is super hot in july(obvi) but the two window units used to cool the apartment really struggled to get it at a bearable level. However, This might be my inner diva side coming out. everything was clean and well kept. Location is superb!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was super comfortable and made my stay in Austin amazing. The apartment is very central to get everywhere but tucked on quiet street to make it a relaxing stay. I loved this apartment and would definitely recommend it again. Host was super responsive and made sure I had all I needed. Thanks for hosting!
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Alexandria was amazingly helpful and very fast to get back to me in regards to my stay in Austin. Her apartment is everything you could ask for: spacious, clean, and charming.  It's located very close to all the action and overall I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay at."

,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was extremely accommodating with my crazy flight schedule and the place is super clean. Located centrally with easy access to south congress where mostly all the action is. 

The bed and place is super clean, comfortable and definitely on my return list. 

Thanks Tiffany,

,,,,,,,,"Great as advertised. The flat is comfortable and clean. The best part is the location and rooftop view. Never met Tiffany, but she was extremely helpful and had precise directions. I would most definitely stay again. Oh also the bed and comforter were very comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,Tiffany was a great host with a great spot close to everything! She made everything easy and I'd recommend it to anyone.
,,,,,,,,Had a great time staying here. It was nice and cozy. Location was good. it was very clean. The place was bright and had really good vibes. wish I could have stayed longer.
,,,,,,,,Tiffany's place was a great location to downtown Austin for our trip.  She had a great list of her favorite places to go which was very helpful and came in handy.  Taco Shack across the street and Dominican Joe's coffee shop right next door made it so easy to cover our breakfast needs.  Access in and out was simple and Tiffany's directions were superb.  Tiffany was great following up with us to make sure we got in okay as well as when we were leaving.  I would highly recommend her place.  
,,,,,,,,"Great location for ACL! 15 minute walk to Zilker and a short walk to downtown as well. The apartment comfortably slept 3 people including the couch. Apartment was very clean, well kept and uniquely decorated. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend it to others."
,,,,,,,,This apartment was fun and cozy. Check in was so easy and the location is perfect. We walked everywhere or paid $10 TOPS for a car service anywhere downtown. It made for an incredible Labor Day weekend. 
,,,,,,,,Thank you!
,,,,,,,,Tiffany was a great host and her apartment was great! It looks exactly like it does in her photos. The location was perfect. Check in and check out couldn't have been easier. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Good host -- convenient place to downtown Austin, nearby restaurants, shops, etc.  Great host, very communicative and thoughtful.  Would definitely think of staying again on another trip to the area."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect, the space was clean, bright and lovely. I went up to the roof one night to watch the sunset and see if I could catch the bats over South Congress. It is walking distance from everywhere, I walked downtown almost every day. I didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it looked clean and nice. 

I really enjoyed my stay here, and Tiffany made everything very easy and comfortable. When I come back to Austin, hopefully this place is available. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time staying at Tiffany's apartment. Amazing location, great apartment and beautiful roof. Tiffany was attentive and helpful, and available to answer any questions within just a few minutes. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was super communicative, respectful, and super helpful. The place was clean, bright, and just as described."
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany did a wonderful job describing her place. It was close to the area we wanted to stay and very convient. Her directions and recommendations were on point. Her place was very clean and welcoming. I would recommend her place to anyone! 
"
,,,,,,,,Very cute place close to downtown and Great host!
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place was perfectly set up. She even had snacks set out for us: chocolate, tea etc. The apartment was very bright and cozy. In a great location and just a short Lyft ride away from the east side where you'll find fantastic restaurants like Ophelia. I only live in San Marcos but I would definitely book this place again as just a fun little get away. I didn't really take advantage of SOCO but that's only because I was there for 1 night. The apartment is the perfect distance to walk to all the restaurants and shopping that SOCO has to offer."
,,,,,,,,Tiffany was a terrific host!  Great communication.  We loved the location of the apartment and she made everything super easy.  We would definitely recommend her place to our friends.  Wonderful weekend!
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place was perfect. We were in town for a music festival and the location was fantastic. Her place was bright, clean, cozy and quiet, just as described. She was extremely accessible and easy to work with, and made our first airbnb experience a massive success.  We would definitely stay there again. Thanks, Tiffany!!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay. It was clean, well furnished, and in a great location.  I did not have a car, but the parking also looked very convenient compared to other places."
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was great and her place was excellent. Location was close to many things; walking distance to Terry Black's Barbecue (some of the best brisket in Austin), Congress bridge and, of course, 6th St. Would stay here again for sure."
,,,,,,,,The place was wonderful. So close to everything in Austin. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Tiffany was super easy to work with and very accommodating. 
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was thorough and prompt.  Everything was as promised.  We added an extra day to our stay weeks before we arrived and AirBB charged us double cleaning fees , that's not the owners problem however.
The lights in the living area didn't turn on and lights in the bedroom were weak for reading. This is best as a two person accommodation . 
I was a little surprised by the single occupancy rule.. Extra for persons 2 and 3.  All in all,  a nice place, best geared for younger travelers .   This place is an easy walk to downtown and congress ave"
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's apartment is really nice and in a brilliant location, perfect for South Congress, downtown, bat watching & getting to the ACL festival. The roof terrace is amazing and good for catching the sun or enjoying a few local brews in the evening. Speaking of which, Tiffany got us some local beers to enjoy on our arrival. That's makes her a great host in my eyes! She's very quick to respond to messages and was helpful when it came to us needing to check out a bit late. Only thing to mention is that the air con above the bedroom can be a bit noisy so worth taking ear plugs if you're a light sleeper. But I'd say that's a small price to pay for what was a brilliant base for a brilliant holiday. "
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay at Tiffany's place for ACL. The location was amazing and very walkable for both the festival and SoCo and downtown! The apartment was clean and comfortable with a funky eclectic vibe. Check in and out was super easy and Tiffany was very responsive to questions throughout our whole stay. Great experience!
,,,,,,,,"it was great, wonderful location and great girl.  we had a wonderful weekend."
,,,,,,,,Loved this place! Perfect location! Walking distance from downtown and SoCo. Really comfortable accommodations! I would definitely recommend this unit. Tiffany was a wonderful host!
,,,,,,,,"Although we never met, Tiffany was a perfect host. The flat was as described and featured in the photos. Although it was on the 5th floor (we are disabled with a dog) there is convenient parking and an elevator not far away. It was warm and cozy on the inside full of colors and a touch of zen. 

**The location really cannot be beat, either. Next time we return to Austin I will be giving Tiffany a heads up. 

She even left us some vino, alas, we don't drink! Good on ya, effort appreciated. "
,,,,,,,,I booked this property as a gift for family.  Tiffany was so easy to deal with and made the transaction a breeze.  I know my family really enjoyed their stay and felt like it was a really special place.
,,,,,,,,We were so comfy in Tiffany's home.  Pretty green view on the balcony and walking distance to see the bats come out from the bridge at night!  Check in and out couldn't have been easier :)!
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was an excellent host! She accommodated our early check-in and was very understanding. The apartment building is in such a fantastic location, convenient to all. Parking was also a breeze! We felt like we were in our own private residence as the unit is on the corner and on the top floor. We never heard or even saw any neighbors! The rooftop had fantastic views and the balcony was a joy to sit on at night. If you are in the area and want to be conveniently located to downtown/SoCo/walk to see the bats every night, this is your spot! The apartment was also appointed with everything we could have needed for our stay. Wonderful in every way!"
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place is exactly as described in both the photos, write-up, and the reviews speak for themselves. 

This was the perfect place and location for us to enjoy a week in Austin. 

The condo is located halfway between Downtown and all the cool restaurants / shops in SoCo, perfect location and a great coffee shop downstairs to relax and do some work in.

The kitchen is great, huge counter tops to prepare meals on. The bathroom is very large and the bed and bedding was top notch.

My girlfriend is an artist and found the lighting and setting inspiring, and I'm no artist but I had a great time in this place! If you are looking to explore Austin I highly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's apartment was perfectly located with easy walking distance to South Congress, as well as 6th Street and Rainey Street. She had some amazing recommendations in her host guide as well -- places that were really off the touristy 'beaten' path. She was an excellent communicator in the check-in and check-out process as well. Five stars to host and apartment"
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany is first and foremost a very genuine, sweet person. Her hosting to her lovely, humble abode; you can only imagine how great it was. Not only her have my dear friend & her son stay and enjoy the pool & peace. But she is so kind to even have a bottle of wine and gifts waiting for their arrival. The experience for me booking with her & my dear friend was beyond 100% satisfactory. I'll recommend to anyone who is coming to austin. Thanks again Tiffany! "
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place was perfect for my fiancÃ©e and I. Perfectly located to make an easy walk through South Congress, or to head north over the bridge toward 6th Street.  

The place was exactly as described and thoroughly cleaned for us upon arrival. Tiffany was even willing to work with us on arranging an early check in due to our timing situation. 

Would definitely rent this place again on future trips to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Tiffany was welcoming and knowledgable about Austin.  She is compassionate and a great host!
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place is super cute and relatively clean. The directions were clear and the location is very convenient.  There is no coffee maker so if that's something important to early risers, come prepared!! There's also a very loud fan noise behind the bedroom wall, so bring sleeping aids if this sort of noise is bothersome to you. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was easy to find, super convenient and right on South Congress! Parking was also a plus and was very secure and was only one stair case up to the room. The place was comfy and cozy! The memory foam pillows were like clouds.  The rooftop was easily accessible and seeing the fireworks on July 4th was enjoyable. "
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place was a delight.  It was exactly as described and even more convenient to local sights than I expected.  Tiffany was one of the most organized hosts I have stayed with.  Instructions were clear, responses were prompt, helpful items laid out on the counter when we walked in.  I couldn't have asked for more.

Pete"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment and great location! Thank you Tiffany!
,,,,,,,,"Thanks to Tiffany's professionalism and her comfortable apartment, our first experience with airbnb was a great one. Her clear instructions and prompt communication made for smooth check-in and check-out. We loved the tranquility of her roomy top-floor apartment, which overlooks a nice little wooded area. The location is really a plus, as it puts you in walking distance from SoCo, Town Lake and downtown. "
,,,,,,,,Tiffany has an awesome spot. Really nice natural light during the day and a cozy vibe at night. Plus my wife was stoked on being able to use the gym.
,,,,,,,,Tiffany was a fabulous host and her place is awesome. Short walk to downtown and probably the most comfortable bed ever.
,,,,,,,,Amazing location - extremely central. Tiffany is a great host and there if you need anything. 
,,,,,,,,Great location and everything as described.  Host very easy to work with and would definitely book again.
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I was impressed with how accommodating Tiffany was. We asked to host a private event on the rooftop lounge, and she really went the extra mile to make sure our event was a success, from reserving it with the leasing office, to posting signs in the area for us, and to making sure that the maintenance crew had completed and cleaned up their work on the roof before we arrived. The location was ideal, a few paces from South Congress Bridge. The apartment of course was beautiful and instructions to get in, park, and find it were easy to follow. We really appreciate all the extra effort, Tiffany, thank you so much!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was wonderful. Tiffany's rules for checking in and out were easy and clear, and her place was clean, welcoming, beautiful, convenient and perfectly located in the city."
,,,,,,,,A top floor sun filled space. Walking to SoCo is a major plus. And Tiffany was extremely accommodating. Thanks Tiffany!
,,,,,,,,Tiffany was a great host-very easy to get in touch with and helpful with lots of recommendations. Her place was perfect-clean and super convenient to S. Congress shops/dining and downtown. Thanks Tiffany!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, beautiful space! We walked our way around such fantastic Austin hot-spots. "
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place was clean, tidy and comfortable.  The location is great - within walking distance to downtown Austin and to all the neat places in SoCo.  Further, Tiffany was also very responsive to any questions I had about the apartment and the city itself.  I had a great experience and I would definitely consider staying at her place should I visit Austin again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place (exactly as advertised), clear instructions and other communication, place is really neat and well attended to. Close to a lot of great coffee places, restaurants and bars, and at the same time close to the highways. Airport is a quick drive, and you can get anywhere else pretty quickly too. I went to Circuit of the Americas and it was only about 20 minutes even with the event traffic."
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place is perfect!  I've stayed at several airbnbs in Austin and her place, the location (to Downtown and the South Congress area) and her as a host - couldn't have been better. My only regret is that I wish I had found her place sooner!"
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany is a great host and I will stay there again, no doubt."

,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was a great host--super flexible and communicative, and very helpful. The apartment is in an outstanding location. Just a fantastic experience all around. Thanks, Tiffany!"
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany did an excellent job welcoming us to Austin this March.  I was planning a surprise getaway for my fiance's 30th birthday and she helped me in advance by suggesting ideas and places to include in the scavenger hunt I was creating (I'd never been to Austin before).  She was extremely accommodating and even let us leave our bags at her house after check out for an additional 6 hours so we could enjoy the town without being weighed down by roller bags!  She left us a little chocolate surprise and was promptly available via phone/chat/text before, during and after our stay.  Her apartment is in a prime location in Austin with walking distance of everything we wanted to do (Zilker, SoCo, 6th street).  Even better, there were hundreds of Lyfts and Ubers around to help us make the most of our little time in the city.  Tiffany is wonderful--I highly recommend checking out her place!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect. The apartment is elegant, perfectly located, spotlessly clean, and Tiffany was the perfect host! "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful, well located apartment, I would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,Exactly as promised. The space was very zen and calming. very convenient location and totally walkable to downtown. Tiffany checked multiple times to make sure I had everything I needed and offered recommendations on places to visit and eat.
,,,,,,,,"Lovely clean spacious place, exactly as advertised. Tiffany gave excellent directions to access the unit, and even left some tasty beverages for me to enjoy. Great location with a rooftop deck to watch the sunsets over downtown. Tiffany made my first trip to Austin an memorable one with her hospitality and insider tips. I hope to be back soon."
,,,,,,,,"Great hostess, she was very accommodating on check-in/check-out times, and allowed our two dogs to come with us to Austin.  The apartment couldn't be in a better location.  It's very neat and she even had a bottle of wine for us.  The rooftop is great on a nice day.  Will definitely be staying again on our next trip to Austin.  Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,The experience using airbnb was made so much easier by Tiffiany's communication leading up to the date of my arrival.

,,,,,,,,The listing and the pictures were quite accurate and Tiffany was great in the lead up to my stay. She communicated often and quickly and made the experience quite good. 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect experience! We were only in town for about 24hrs and we were so lucky we found this spot. Tiffany greeted us with a warm hug and showed us around. She went over everything we would need to know, took us on a tour (the roof is killer) and then she let us do our thing. The location is about as good as it gets. A quick walk to soco and about a $5 uber ride to downtown, hard to beat that! My wife and I would stay there again in a heartbeat! Thanks Tiffany!!"
,,,,,,,,Staying at Tiffany's house was a wonderful piece of privacy in the middle of the SoCo chaos!  The apartment was exactly as described.  She was a terrific host and very responsive to phone calls and emails.  
,,,,,,,,"The condo was great! Perfect location to bike to the soco shops and restaurants and the greenbelt. Can't wait to come back in the summer to enjoy the rooftop lounge area! Tiffany is a sweetheart and even mailed my shoes back that i left there, yes I left my shoes..."
,,,,,,,,"Smart, tidy place in a great spot from which to explore (mmm, food) Austin. Tiffany was a gracious host and put up with some ropey communication from me with nary a complaint. I'm sorry we didn't get to meet you, Tiffany, but thank you very much for making us feel so welcome! We'd definitely  stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was so sweet and awesome! She was very welcoming and made sure our stay in Austin went well. Before the trip, we had all the information we needed and she gave us a helpful list of things to eat/do/see. Upon our arrival, there was a bottle of wine and she checked in with us throughout the week to make sure we had everything we needed.

The place itself was nice as well. Centrally located - within walking distance to SoCo - safe and easy to access. Her apartment is very clean and decorated with lots of plants and trees - something I really loved. 

I definitely recommend this place and would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was a great host.  She was prompt with communication, flexible with arrival & departure times, has a wonderful apartment and was very considerate.

We loved staying at Tiffany's place and would happily do so again."
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany was a great host.  Check-in and check-out was easy.  Her place was really clean, and it was the perfect location to all things fun in Austin.   She even left us a nice bottle of wine and brews as a welcome present.  Definitely will re-book for future Austin trips."
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at Tiffany's place. It was perfect! Beautiful accommodations, just what we needed for a quick Austin getaway. We walked everywhere we went over the weekend. Location was ideal, and the rooftop a great place to take in the city and share some champaign. "
,,,,,,,,Great communication from Tiffany about rental. Place was nice and clean. Let me check in and out at the times I wanted. Location is great right between downtown and all the south congress shops. Parking is easy if you have a car but you really don't need one if you are sticking around downtown area. Would stay again if ever back in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Tiffany's place was great, and she was so accommodating. She met me right on time to hand over the keys and we ended up chatting a bit about the place and fun things to do nearby. Her place was clean and comfortable and I felt right at home. The rooftop was amazing also - a great view and a great vibe! It's just so close to everything and I enjoyed it immensely. Hopefully I'll be back soon!"
15221807,,9,10,6,9,10,10,The place is central for reaching most of Austin by car and very close to downtown! Walking distance to clubs (10-25min) and some good restaurants (soco/downtown). Areas of the apartment were a bit dirty when we got there. Overall it was a great space and Kevin checked in frequently and gave us good instructions. 
,,,,,,,,"Had a good experience, nice place to stay in, very comfortable, the host, Kevin, made sure we had everything we needed, would recommend to stay."
15568945,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Just a perfect location right on Rainey street. Apartment was spotless.  Exactly what we were looking for. 
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at 91 Rainey -- the apartment overlooked Rainey St., appeared brand new inside, had a huge bathroom, was impeccably clean and was close to everything.  It was very quiet inside the apartment.  We will be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Such a great experience and UH-mazing location right on Rainey! But for the hustle and bustle that is Rainey, it still afforded a shockingly quiet space. Immaculate and updated apartment, great styling and extremely comfortable beds. Nitesh was very easy to get ahold of and responsive when I had questions. Would highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Great great location! Rainey Street is a great place with bars, pubs and restaurants and a great grocery store within 5 blocks.  The place was immaculate and check in was very easy.  Great value compared to a hotel and walk to everything in downtown Austin. "
8609971,,10,10,10,10,10,10,Evie is easy to communicate with and so was her roommate. I rented the place for ACL (went with kids) and it felt safe and was conveniently located near Zilker. I was comfortable with them walking to and from the concerts...and there are plenty of places to eat nearby.
15058997,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Perfect location! Right in the heart of Rainey Street, one of our favorite parts of Austin, and a short walk to the river. Building is brand new, washer and dryer in unit, building has a rooftop pool we were unable to take advantage of. The hosts were very helpful and communicative. They were able to supply a pack and play for our little man. Would definitely rent again here."
,,,,,,,,Yes
,,,,,,,,"Danny and Lisa's condo was the perfect location for our stay in Austin.     We had a busy weekend planned, and the host hotel was directly across the street.    Rainey street has a very fun, young vibe,  which worked for us because we could  stop at a restaurant or bar after arriving back to the condo late each evening.    The condo was super neat and clean, and  it was especially nice that the hosts left everything we needed to make coffee, have beer or wine and have a snack or two.    The condo was quiet and anyone we met in the hall seemed pleasant and polite. "
,,,,,,,,Great clean place. A lot of nice small details. Easy to work and coordinate with. Great value!
,,,,,,,,"My stay was great! The location, and amenities great as well. Danny and Lisa were very helpful when needed and were very quick to respond. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone visiting Austin.

,,,,,,,,The house was just as listed and amazingly clean!  Had all the info we needed but never had to contact the host as everything went smoothly.  
,,,,,,,,Never actually interacted with a person...but didn't need too.  Received timely text and email updates prior to arrival.  Everything worked smoothly.  Great house.  Would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Thank you for letting us into the house early, the place worked out great for our trip. We would definitely book through Bob and his company again. House was clean and there were plenty of towels."

8220727,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Location is fantastic and Margaux was super helpful.  The condo itself is a bit tight for four adults, but would be perfect for a group of 2-3.  Sound isolation is admittedly not great, but the hosts graciously provide some amenities to combat this (earplugs, white noise machine, etc).

Overall, a great choice for those who prize a central location at an affordable price."
,,,,,,,,Great location! Friendly host! 
,,,,,,,,Margaux's apartment is in GREAT location! There are lots of restaurants nearby. The room is in good condition and everything is clean and neat. Margaux is a responsible and nice host. We had a great time here.

Being able to walk to Rainey street, 6th street, the capitol, and the river was very convenient and Margaux was  extremely communicative about tips for transportation from the airport and check in process.  The location was clean and nicely set up.  Enjoyed the stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great location if you have meetings downtown, an event at the conf center, or want to explore the downtown area. We had a problem with the electricity, but Margaux was super fast to respond and worked to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible. The place is well equipped with everything you need to have a good stay and enjoy the city."
,,,,,,,,Great location! Great communication and instructions. Everything you need for your stay. Only con was the wifi was spotty for work.
,,,,,,,,Great location! Apartment was clean and ready for check-in early. Margaux was available throughout if we needed anything. Thanks!

,,,,,,,,Margaux was fantastic and attentive to my questions. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place, not far from 6th street bars. Very clean and comfortable place. Would definitely come back."
,,,,,,,,Great location steps away from lots to see and do in austin. Very comfortable unit with everything you need for a nice stay. 
,,,,,,,,"I went there for the F1 weekend. The place was nice, location is perfect and Margaux was super responsive. All in all good experience."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was absolutely as described, perfect location. Highly recommend Margaux's place."

,,,,,,,,This was the perfect place for staying in downtown Austin over the weekend! Margaux was very helpful in making sure everything went smoothly.
,,,,,,,,"Nice, clean and very pleasant hostess"
,,,,,,,,Great location and great place
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was wonderful! The location is extremely convenient for walking around downtown Austin, including 6th Street, Rainey Street, and many restaurants. We were in town for a UT game, so we also walked to the UT stadium, which is a good 30 minutes but very doable with sights of the Capital along the way. Margaux is extremely accommodating and was very helpful with anything we needed. I highly recommend for anyone looking for a convenient stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The location was perfect! Convent to the bars, restaurants, and downtown life. 

The condo was beautiful! Looked exactly like the pictures. Fabulous condition. 

Our host was lovely! Very accommodating and gave quick clear communication. "
,,,,,,,,Great neighborhood! It was within walking distance to everything that we wanted to see! Very easy and convenient stay!
,,,,,,,,"Beside the fact that the subject line said $125/night Aug Special and we ended up paying $275/night.  The were very good in communication before we got there, and also after we arrived, we saw the notes and card, it was nice.  It was nice that there were coffee and juice available.  The place felt clean and professionally organized.  Overall, it was a good experience and we had a good time. "
,,,,,,,,"Unit was conveniently located, spacious and clean. Property manager is a tad bit overwhelming to deal with.. But the property is great! "
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a weekend in Austin and this was the perfect location for downtown. It's very walkable to many restaurants, Rainey St, and 6th St. The space was also the perfect size for us, and we made ourselves right at home.

Margaux also lives in the building, and she  was easily accessible and very sweet. Would totally recommend staying here. Great value and location!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Clean and fully stocked! Right in the middle of all the action. Margaux was very helpful and friendly.
We will be back!"
,,,,,,,,My husband and I had a great stay at the Burgdale. The location is absolutely perfect to explore downtown Austin. We had everything we needed in this apartment. It truly felt like our home away from home. It was nice having keyless (URL HIDDEN) less thing to worry about. We will definitely stay here again. Margaux was easy to get a hold of and we were even able to check in early. Perfect vacation spot!
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was very helpful at all times. The condo was great, very convenient to the conference I was at two blocks away, and the bed was very comfortable. I did see packets of disposable earplugs had been provided but I had no noise problems while staying there. Note that this condo is on the second floor and there is no elevator. The check-in process was easy given that you use codes to open the outside door to the complex, and the condo itself."
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location! Arrival was very easy and apartment was clean and as described. We used the sofa bed and it was very comfortable, no issues. There are several other rental units in the complex and the apartment is located right off the center courtyard and stairs where everyone enters, so we did have noise from a few rowdier groups coming and going at night. Overall it didn't bother us but may not be the best place if you are a light sleeper! Very good experience "
,,,,,,,,"Margaux's place was great! Awesome location, very walkable to a lot that Austin has to offer. Margaux was quick to respond and had clear check in instructions. The space was great for 4 people. "
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at the Burgdale. Margaux was easy to get a hold of and very attentive to our needs. The location is very centric and walking distance from many restaurants and bars. 
,,,,,,,,The host was truly wonderful!!! The condo was the perfect weekend getaway location. I would return next weekend if possible!!! Margaux again was great and so very welcoming !!!!
,,,,,,,,The apartment was clean and exactly as represented. It was also copiously stocked with anything a traveler may need during a stay. Margaux was exceptionally accommodating and friendly. I highly recommend staying at the condo.
,,,,,,,,"Great Host! Very friendly and accommodating! Helped us figure out our parking situation. And the whole stay was perfect! Thank u so much 
"
,,,,,,,,Great space and great location!  I had a great time.
,,,,,,,,We had a great time at the Burgdale. The accommodation was great and the place was very well equipped. It was in close proximity to downtown and we even could walk to UT from where we stayed. We would highly recommend it to friends who travel there in future. Overall we had a great experience. 
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Burgdale! This adorable unit is exactly as the pictured. Margaux was an excellent host! She gave us all the details we needed for a comfortable stay and was available at any moment we needed her. The apartment was in the heart of Austin, perfect location to walk just about everywhere or a short cab ride. Very fun complex, younger crowd. I wouldn't recommend for a quiet tranquil retreat. But, if you enjoy a little noisy fun, its the perfect spot! We hope to come back soon!!"
,,,,,,,,"This unit at the Burgdale was great. Everything was very clean and the unit was spacious. The location is ideal for visiting Austin, as it is in the middle of everything but is still a quiet building. The host is very accommodating as well. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was the perfect host!
The apartment is in an ideal location and has all the amenities you would be after.
I will definitely stay there the next time I am in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Margaux has this down to a science! Everything was smooth as silk. All I needed to know was in one easy-to-scan place. The room was perfect - everything was clean and exactly as represented in the listing. Next time you come to Austin, do yourself a favor and stay at Margaux's. "
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was very helpful and communicated quickly & clearly. Her tip to take the bus from airport was good. It dropped us off at the intersection of 4th & Trinity kitty-corner from the Railyard apartments. We upgrades to $3.50 bus pass and it was good for 24 hours. Used it the next day to go to LBJ Library at Univ  of Texas. Some people came back from bars at 2:30 am and Margaux helped to quiet them down. 

The apartment is very nice: comfortable bed, working washing machine & dryer means you can pack fewer clothes, dishwasher works (the switch is on the wall), shower is great, fridge & microwave work. Wifi connects but it's slow when lots of people are in the apartments, faster after they all leave. The apartment is very clean. The keyless locks on door worked fine. The complex has interior hallways that act like an echo chamber where people talk even at normal volume down the hall and the sound comes through the bedroom window. Also it's urban so you can hear buses, trucks, motorcycles, fire engines, etc. 

Location is great: walk to downtown & Rainey Street, Congress Bridge, the river, And at least 3 BBQ places. Walked to 801 bus to South Congress. Walked to two small markets around the corner to get stuff for breakfast. And the price was less than hotels that weekend. "
,,,,,,,,Margaux was helpful from the beginning. I had some questions about the sleeping accommodations and she answered my questions right away. I also received all the details prior to my arrival. I had a wonderful stay and the location was only half a block to the Austin Convention Center. That was a huge plus!
,,,,,,,,Margaux was very nice and extremely helpful. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. This was my first experience using air bnb and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone. The location was perfect and it allowed us to really get to know the area. We also were able to take advantage of the $20 parking that was available on site which was very convenient.
,,,,,,,,"This place was great and the host was friendly and helpful. I've stayed in this condo complex numerous times and love the security and the location - so close to everything! The condo, although small, is laid out really well so it feels spacious. "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful stay! Everything was convenient and easy. Thanks for a great stay!
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was an excellent host - very friendly and helpful. Condo was clean on arrival. The location was ideal for my symposium. Numerous restaurants within walking location. If you are looking for a place with coffee, outlets, and sandwich's check out Halcyon which is about a 7 min walk from the condo. Fully recommended."
,,,,,,,,"The Burgdale is an excellent apartment, a couple of blocks away from 6th street where all the bars and music venues are, we could not be located any better! 

The apartment itself was perfect for what we were looking for, decent size for 3 people, super clean and welcoming. The building is kind of exotic, with digital pass-codes to get in, so we did not need keys and everyone had access to the apartment at all times.  There is a grocery store a couple of blocks away where we got essentials for our stay. 

I will definitely be staying here again, thanks Margaux for a great experience, you made Austin feel like home for us! "
,,,,,,,,This space was perfect for what I was looking for; A central downtown location for the SXSW Interactive conference near the convention center and nightlife.  This location is literally half a block from the convention center and right in the middle of all the action.  The space was large enough for myself and a guest or two which was perfect for sleeping near the conference and brief business meetings.  The host was extremely helpful not only in helping me find this particular location but also during my stay.  Had only one problem (wifi access) and it was addressed very quickly.
,,,,,,,,The 1-bedroom apartment is very clean and comfortable. The host is so considerate that kettle and other necessities are all provided. Just 1 reminder: you want to confirm receiving the codes to the main entry and apartment door before your arrival. Air bnb didn't give me the codes until the day we left. It really took a while to call the host in a rainy day.
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was amazing and so was her place! It was in a perfect location, close to everything ! The apt was nice as well and had such a comfortable bed! Can't recommend this place enough!"
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was a fantastic host!  She was very friendly and always quick to respond to any questions I had.  She was happy to let us check in a few hours early, and gladly stored our luggage for a few hours on the way out.  
The Burgdale was a great place to stay.  The location couldn't be better, and is in a great location to walk to pretty much any neighborhood in Austin.  The layout of the place was exactly like the pictures showed.  It was very clean, smelled clean, and was fully stocked with everything you'd expect in a rental.  The bed was comfy and easily fit two people.  The development was quiet.  The building had secured entry, and felt safe.  
I would definitely recommend staying at the Burgdale on your next trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great spacious apartment in downtown Austin, close to everything. Clean, has everything you need. Felt completely at home. Margaux was also very understanding when I inquired about a late checkout. Instructions about getting there were great, keypad entry so no issues with keys either. Great experience all round. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect. Everything about this location and apartment was perfect. Kitchen was stocked with everything you need. All the toiletries you need. It was basically like living in my own apartment! Location was amazing - right downtown. Anytime I come back to Austin I will be staying here. I recommend it to everyone! 
,,,,,,,,I LOVED LOVED LOVED staying at here! We had everything that we could've possibly needed for us at the apartment. The apartment was cozy and close to everything in downtown Austin. Margaux was the perfect host. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Great location!  The apartment was clean and comfortable - exactly as described.
,,,,,,,,Great stay. Super location. Everything was perfect. 
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect. Close to everything. Very Clean and comfortable. The host was very helpful. This was my first experience with AirBNB and it was wonderful. Can't wait to try it again. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was very responsive. We were able to check-in early because our flight got in early. The location is great. Walked to 6th street, capital, and Rainey street. Took $6 Uber to Lbj library and s. Congress street. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"I had a fantastic stay at this adorable apartment in the heart of downtown Austin!  The space is so organized & clean.  The decor & furnishings are comfortable and cheery.  The location was really convenient for me too.  Margaux, the property manager, is so friendly, accommodating and helpful.  I would certainly stay here again and highly recommend it.  Thanks so much! "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was awesome! Would stay again and again and again. Amazing location, directions were crystal clear, couldn't have been better. "
,,,,,,,,"The location is ideal (close to both 6th St and Rainey St, not that far from both South Congress and UT campus).

Margaux was very attentive (quick to respond to texts, replaced light bulb as soon as alerted, and asked neighbors about hot water issue that we had).

I have two pieces of criticism: 1) The internet is very slow (I believe it is shared among the building). Yelp and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps both were very slow to load, and I often found myself using my cellphone instead of using the wifi with my computer. 2) A hot bath doesn't seem possible. Part way through filling up the bath tub, the hot water would turn to warmish water. This happened both times I tried. (I'm guessing the hot water tank is small)"
,,,,,,,,Excellent place and experience! Thank you for your hospitality!
,,,,,,,,Nice little apartment. Great location. Thanks Margaux.
,,,,,,,,"Great place!  Just as advertised, and very comfortable.  Would be happy to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, clean and comfortable apartment, looks very much like the pictures.  Was very easy to get into the apartment the first time!

Also provided everything needed to make coffee which is always an added bonus :)"
,,,,,,,,The Burgdale was an excellent choice for our stay in Austin. It was comfortable and in a great location. Margaux was an excellent host.
,,,,,,,,Had a wonderful stay and will definitely be staying here again!
,,,,,,,,"This unit was fantastic.  The apartment was fully furnished with a single bed, non pull out couch, big screen LED TV, fridge, range and microwave.  Also full laundry services.

I had one minor issue which the super took care of in a flash! 
Communication was constant and easy.  I look forward to staying there atain.
"
,,,,,,,,We had a cancellation at another place and needed a rental property in Austin at the very last minute. Margaux was so fast and provided such great hospitality that we were happy that it happened. The unit is perfectly located downtown and is walking distance to so many great places. It's clean and comfortable and a great bargain for anyone looking to visit Austin. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, awesome location, and Margaux was very accommodating when we made a last minute booking. Could have used more towels as there were three of us, so you may want to bring one of your own. "
1003316,5,9,10,10,10,10,9,"The host has a beautiful, clean and organized home. It was a pleasure to stay there and was in a perfect location near the ACL festival. She was very accommodating too since we had delays in our arrival on the first day. All in all, first class service and a fantastic place to stay."
,,,,,,,,"Negar was extremely welcoming and her home was very comfortable for my family. Our children were with us and the home was perfect for them. There were toys, swings, a lovely patio and garden, and the boys loved it. For us, it meant we could be close to Zilker Park for ACL Festival and we were able to walk to and from the house. Thanks for hosting us, Negar!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a very pleasant six night stay while attending Fantastic Fest, with an easy five minute walk to the venue. Top marks for Negar and family for their cozy and convenient house! And for being such gracious and attentive hosts. Everything's in order here, and the neighborhood is quiet and relaxing. Will definitely want to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Negar and family were great,  the house was perfect and all went well. Really nice neighborhood and great access to downtown.  I feel bad because one of our less reliable housemates may have been passed out in their bed after check out time. I hope he wasn't a burden. I also need to mail back a second key I accidentally took with me! "
,,,,,,,,"My coworker and I were in Austin for SXSW and this house was perfect for our stay! A cute family home in a quiet, quintessential-Austin neighborhood. Listing description is accurate - the house was even more spacious than what we expected from photos, MORE than enough room for 2 people. We felt extremely welcomed by our host. Super easy to get to and from downtown via Uber or the SXSW shuttle which stops at the nearby Alamo Drafthouse. While great for business travel, this house is PERFECT for a family trip too!"
,,,,,,,,The perfect house for a week of SXSW(or just a few days of Austin)!! Its a very relax neighborhood and no traffic. We spend our mornings and nights relaxing outside in the large patio. If you like cooking the kitchen provides you superb pots an pans and a large double oven! The house had more then enough space for the 4 of us.  
,,,,,,,,Our experience in Austin at Negars went exactly as advertised. This house was a 5 minute walk from zilker park and close to many great local restaurants and bars. Inside the house it was very clean and comfortable but the real highlight was the patio. The patio was spacious and fun. It was very relaxing and all the guests in the house mentioned it as a highlight. Negar was very accommodating as a host...she even left some coffee and wine for us to enjoy :) I would definitely recommend this house for anyone that is looking for a nice quiet place in Austin to enjoy.
11042874,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Terrific condo.  Stayed here 9 nights and was very comfortable the entire stay. Just outside of downtown, but rideshare services were very available.  The photos are accurate and do a great job of showing what a nice place you'll be staying in.  Had a wonderful time here. "
,,,,,,,,"My husband, two small children, and I had a great stay here. The location was perfect (within walking distance to the trails by Lady Bird Lake, Downtown, and SoCo) and the condo was clean, beautifully decorated, comfortable, and with great views of the city. The building is new and the staff were very friendly. We would love to stay here again one day!"
,,,,,,,,Beautiful apartment and friendly host. Really enjoyed my stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a great experience from start to finish, the apartment I was interested in was booked before I could make a reservation, and LeeAnn was able to find another and match the price in the same building.

The location is perfect with plenty of places to eat nearby at walking distance including downtown Austin.

Defensively recommend them and would use them again for my upcoming business trip soon back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Exactly as described and in great location. Would use again and recommend to others.

,,,,,,,,"The apartment is on the ground floor with keypad entry. We stayed there on the Monday night, which apparently is their trash day, and the noise level outside the bedroom could not be ignored throughout the night. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was super cute and clean. I really enjoyed staying there and perfect for a weekend stay. Within walking distance of Austin's nightlife and the state capitol. 
,,,,,,,," Georgia made me feel so welcomed. She was very quick at responding to my questions over email and very accommodating. We will definitely visit with Georgia the next time we are in Austin, Texas. "
,,,,,,,,"Super easy to get in, amazing location. Perfect for my quick business trip."
,,,,,,,,"Clean and convenient space in a great neighborhood. Not great for more than 1 couple in my opinion because the bathroom is off the bedroom, not in a common space. If someone's sleeping in the bedroom it's really not ideal to have others coming in to use the bathroom. Otherwise I highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Georgia was a great host. She checked in with me before our trip to be sure any questions were answered and she provided answers promptly. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and the location was convenient. Overall the apt was exactly as described. 
The only downside to the apt was the noise from the upstairs neighbors walking on the wood floors above....the neighbors were't noisy but the floors were. Other than that, everything else was great. 
This was my first use of Airbnb and it was a very pleasant experience. "
,,,,,,,,Awesome location within walking distance to everything 6th street has to offer. Apartment was spotless upon arrival and exactly what we needed for a weekend getaway. Highly recommend Georgia as a host/location for your next Austin trip.

,,,,,,,,"Great host, location and appartment!
Definetly recommanding it"
,,,,,,,,"Great area to stay in, walking distance to shops & restaurants. Small & cozy, great place to stay for a weekend. "
,,,,,,,,Great place in an even better location!
,,,,,,,,"Georgia has a very lovely condo.  The pictures are a very accurate and the home could not be more cozy.  The unit, situated about 1.5 miles from the convention center, is very convenient and centrally located.  Across the parking lot is a cozy bakery with the best coffee around.  Whole Foods and Trader Joe's are just a couple blocks away.  Georgia has a kitchen full of cookware and dishes.  The neighborhood is very quiet and everyone I ran into was very friendly.  I'd definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,The perfect place for a weekend visit to Austin! Myself and 3 girlfriends had the best time staying here and exploring the city. Close and walkable to all sections of 6th street and a short ride to Rainey. The place is adorable and perfect for 4 guests. 
,,,,,,,,Had a pleasant experience with this place. Great apartment for 1-2 people and Georgia was a great host. 
,,,,,,,,Had a great time! Would definitely recommend staying here in the future. 
,,,,,,,,Beautiful space that is exactly what you see in pics. Great communication without ever having to actually meet. Which sometimes is preferred 
,,,,,,,,"Exactly as described and pictured!!!

Great location ... Walking distance to Whole Foods Market and much more!!

A must ... Walk across the parking lot to the local Bakery ... Coffee and Ham-n-Cheese Croissant ... Breakfast!

Please stay here ... You will love it!"
,,,,,,,,Beautiful place in the perfect location! Georgia is wonderful and accommodating. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Georgia's apartment was great. I was due to stay in another AirBNB and the host cancelled on me the day of, yet Georgia was able to immediately accommodate me. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures and you can't beat the west 6th Street location. I would happily stay here again when in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Georgia was an amazing host for our weekend trip to Austin! Her apartment was clean and had everything we needed to feel like an Austinite; not to mention, her apartment was in the perfect location to downtown and a bunch of delicious restaurants! She made sure to reach out to us during our stay to see if everything was running smoothly. I would definitely stay there again! "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful place, easy communication and access, enjoyed myself very much. Thank you to a great host!"
,,,,,,,,"What a perfect, CHARMING abode! I've stayed in Georgia's other Austin home so when I needed a place in Austin recently I booked this one. It's right in the heart of the city and its simply perfect. The location is excellent, I felt very safe, and the amenities are so luxe. Everything is upscale and EVERY detail was considered. Even a patio area for alfresco cocktails!! Clean, stylish, classy- I felt like I had my own fabulous pied-Ã -terre!!! I was alone but I think this would also be a great escape for a couple or girlfriends on a weekend excursion. 

Also, since it matters - my inquiry was answered timely and professionally. Georgia is an awesome host!!!!! You will not regret this booking. :)"
,,,,,,,,Brilliant stay. Amazing location. Host was v attentive and absolutely everything in place was as described. Would highly recommend for anyone wishing to enjoy Clarksville neighborhood of ATX to the full. Stumbling distance from Clarks simply cannot be overvalued. 
,,,,,,,,This was a very beautiful home! Very close to the downtown scene and easy to access with a pin code on the door. I would highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is really cute and perfect for what I needed. It's close to everything and in walking distance to a lot of stuff. It's right off a popular restaurant's parking lot, so it does get noisy at times, but nothing too crazy. I'd definitely recommend Georgia's place and would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,Georgia couldn't have been any more helpful. Very kind host. The location is amazing and really helped being so centrally located. I wish the studio had a microwave and the bed frame either needs to be replaced or tightened up. LOUD every time you moved and at times thought it might give out. Otherwise a very pleasant experience!
,,,,,,,,"A nice clean apt in the middle of Austin . Has a parking space which we liked. 
"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is a perfect size for two people and in a fabulous location, being walking distance to great restaurants, bakeries and shopping. The off-street location made for a quiet experience and very easy parking on site. It would be great for a short or long stay if you want to be in downtown Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Super convenient, clean and cute apartment in awesome neighborhood. My husband and I stayed here for a few days on a road trip, it was a great base to explore the city. Also there's tons to do in the neighborhood, walking distance to the river/parks, Waterloo records and restaurants. We had a great dinner at Clark's and Sweetish is a great coffee shop to start the day. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time staying in Georgia's place,  she was very accommodating and friendly!! It was the perfect size for us as a couple and was very clean.  Everything we needed was there and easy to use/worked well. The best part was THE LOCATION.  We walked everywhere and Uber/Lyft rides were very inexpensive to get anywhere downtown.  Overall great experience! We would definitely stay there again!!!! Thank you Georgia!!!!"
5164094,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"I can't say enough about what great experience this was. 
We are professional colleagues that were in town for a technical conference. This house proved to be a wonderful home away from home. Itâ€™s a super comfortable space that lets every guest have both a nice level of personal privacy and comfort; with good shared areas for hanging out and spending time together as a group. 

Everything is very well appointed; it's clean, comfortable, and modern. Location wise it is located in a wonderfully quiet area that is super close to everything in Austin.

Lastly, I want to thank Laura, the Property Manager, for being an amazingly helpful and gracious host. From the initial booking to our group checking out; she could not have been more helpful and nice. She made sure to check in on us from time to time to ensure  we were comfortable; and she responded almost instantly to any questions we had.

I'd recommend this house for anyone seeking an wonderful stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great house for a bachelor party.  Laura (property manager) was amazing from start to finish.  The house was exactly as advertised and made for a great stay in Austin.  I would stay here again the next time a group of us visits Austin.
,,,,,,,,"The host was very attentive, communicative, and accommodating. The house was simply amazing and more impressive than the photos. If ever in Austin again, I will be staying here. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location (close to Rainey Street which has great food and bars, and not far from pretty much anywhere to go in Austin), comfortable home with a small backyard and backyard games like cornhole, responsive owners/property manager. My group and I very much enjoyed this home and the experience. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"The property manager was very helpful with our stay at Austin which made the experience turnkey. The house was amazing fitting 10 people perfectly, and the location was great. Just a couple of blocks from Rainey St."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing home in a fantastic location.  

Loved the beautiful and well appointed home, with all the electronic luxury features that one could desire.  Great TVs and Sonos.  Relaxing backyard, and comfortable common space.  The bedrooms had great privacy, and the bathrooms were beautifully done.

Fantastic hostess, with wonderful and helpful website.

Would certainly return to Austin and stay in this home again.   "
,,,,,,,,This is a great home and the hosts were awesome! We'd definitely come back again. 
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful house, great location "
,,,,,,,,"They were easy to communicate with, the house was clean, and beautiful. "
,,,,,,,,"The stay was everything we were expecting and more. The house was perfect for our group of 9 with plenty of space to hang out both inside and out. The rooms were clean and well stocked with everything we needed.  I can't say enough good things about the Property manager Laura, who was always there to answer questions and help us out with whatever we needed. The location of the house is perfect, walkable to Rainey street and just a short cab ride to everywhere else. House had all the high tech amenities that we were hoping for. Highly recommended and would stay again if our group ever visits Austin again!"
,,,,,,,,"The end to end experience with the house was excellent. The location was perfect for our group to have walking access to Rainey St. and E 6th street. The house is extremely well done with tv, sound systems, bedrooms, towels, kitchen supplies, etc. Also, the backyard is perfect for relaxing outside, play lawn games, grill, etc.

Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Kevin's house was awesome! We were in Austin for a wedding, and couldn't have been happier with the space and location. It's a stone's throw from Rainey street and walking distance to 6th street. The couch and beds were super comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"Our house manager Laura was literally there every step of the way, even calling up with alternative strategies after Uber and Lyft cancelled their service a couple days before we arrived. She was awesome, we were treated extremely well. 

We were 10-14 guys on a guys weekend and ended up renting Boho Chic as well, which is the adjoining house laid out in almost exactly the same way.

It's about a 5-10 walk from Rainy street which has an awesome bar scene and great late night truck options. 

The only downside was that it was hot and they didn't have a pool, but that did force us to go to Barton Springs which was a great experience. 

Note: all of the beds are queens or kings so you'll be doubling up if you have a big group.


 "
,,,,,,,,"This is how an AIRBNB is supposed to be run.  Turnkey is probably the best way to describe.  Electronic locks, plenty of kitchen/toilet essentials and the best amenities I've seen in any of my experiences with AirBnB.  Our host Laura was helpful from initial introductions until our final check out.  HIHGLY RECOMMEND for groups"
,,,,,,,,"We had a tremendous time at Kevin's. The place was incredibly cool and very clean. The host was responsive and easy to deal with. The neighborhood was perfect, cool to everything but not in the middle of everything. I would highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect for our group. Incredibly well designed, very fun, convenient location,  great size, nice backyard. Laura, the house manager, was incredible - super helpful, very quick to respond, very nice and very thoughtful. Would HIGHLY recommend this house!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Stayed here with seven of us and what a perfect venue!! House is modern and cosy - sonos, nest, great showers, washing machine and an amazing (URL HIDDEN) has it all. House is very central and easy to grab an Uber from. House was extremely clean and cosy and great spot to come back to after a day of sightseeing. Thanks again!!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was fantastic. I had lots of questions leading up to our trip and Laura (the house manager) was helpful and quick to reply to everything. Loved how comfortable the units were, and the decor (especially the bathrooms) was awesome. Very spacious and comfortable for our large party. "
,,,,,,,,"Great space, near walk paths, super comfy beds, great kitchen and bathrooms to host a group."
,,,,,,,,The house is so nice and clean! Would definitely stay here again! Easy walking distance to restaurants and more. 
,,,,,,,,The house was in perfect condition and beautiful.  The house looks even better than the pictures on the website.  All the furniture was comfortable to lounge on and the beds were great too.  Great location for a walk along the river or into the downtown area.  I will be recommending this house to others coming to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Amazing great house, clean and well thought out.
Wonderful house manager!"
,,,,,,,,"My college roommates and  I rented this house for a weekend reunion.  There were six of us.  It was very comfortable for all six of us -very modern and spacious and also had a nice outdoor space.  It really has everything you need for a great stay in Austin.  It is about a 5 min walk to Rainey Street- we walked everywhere we went,  downtown, to the bars on Sixth Street,  etc.  An Uber from the airport was around $15- $20 dollars I think.   There are also some good coffee shops in the neighborhood a few blocks away.  No complaints... great place for a big group to stay.  "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place for our group!  The house was in great shape when we arrived, he let us check-in early, and  everything was working properly."
,,,,,,,,"Kevin was the perfect host, he was incredibly fast in his responses, gave clear instructions on how to check in/check out, and provided a small gift bag upon arrival.  The space was walking distance from Rainey street, very large, and had a great backyard.  I would highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"A great property very close to all the good spots in Austin. We had a large group and this place was perfect. Kevin was also very accommodating our various arrivals / departures and directing us to services (Instacart, Uber, etc) that made our stay that much smoother. 
"
,,,,,,,,"The house set up was great, perfect for a bachelor/bachelorette party. Newly furnished with a good outdoor area. The neighborhood was close to downtown and very convenient. Would definitely rent again. "

,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, cozy home  (awesome records) , great host! Definitely book this."
,,,,,,,,The place is really close to 6th street but it is still really peaceful. Definitely give it a shot
,,,,,,,,"I really appreciated how homey the apartment is! It was such a great space, it was very enjoyable. She was also very easy to communicate with, was quick to respond to questions, and very nice! Samantha made sure we had everything we needed prior to arriving. Would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Very accommodating place,  great location, and comfy beds! Samantha responds quickly and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Gracious host, cozy space, and a great location!"
,,,,,,,,"Samantha was there when I arrived. She gave me the run down on the coffee, record player, and parking spot out back, making me feel right at home."
,,,,,,,,Great stay
,,,,,,,,"A great place to visit! I walked all over the place on the trail, enjoyed the park, and got to experience being close to downtown nightlife while still having a quiet place to retreat to. Other residents were very welcoming too. I'd recommend if you want a local experience!"
,,,,,,,,Great place. Would stay again 
,,,,,,,,Samantha's place was nice had lots of parking. Although she only had one proper bed and a pull out couch she had sleeping bags and other accommodations which was perfect. She was very friendly and always replied fast if we had any questions. 
,,,,,,,,Everything was as planned and advertised. Would highly recommend staying here as a simple getaway to downtown Austin with a great location next to Pease Park!
,,,,,,,,"Great location walking distance of all the main hot spots including (graffiti park, the capitol, UT and 6th st. Samantha is super responsive and flexible to make your stay nice! "
13235265,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,What an amazing property and an amazing location! This is absolutely a place you want to stay.
,,,,,,,,"The building is named Millennium, and is quite appropriate: the building is full of millennials! The space itself is clean, well-stocked and ample, and has the feel of a millennial's first apartment, furnished from IKEA. The bed is comfortable--important for me. The bedside tables could use lamps and a clock, though. The sliding glass door to the patio cannot be locked, although being on the 4th floor adds some safety--the neighbor would have to jump over from their patio--possible but not likely. 
The floor plan is a bit weird from an architectural point of view. The kitchen is too big, reducing the size of the living area (there is no dining table, or room for one). Similarly, the bathroom and walk-in closet are unaccountably large--this could have been a two-bedroom apartment. 
As for location, it's hard to beat: close to lots of fun food and social venues, as well as the Austin Convention Center and I-35. 
"
,,,,,,,,"What a fantastic Airbnb experience! Corey & Amanda were ideal hosts... quick to respond to any questions with perfect attention to detail. The apartment was immaculate, their check-in/out processes were well organized... and that location! I was there for an event at the Austin Convention Center, just a couple blocks from the apartment. And when I needed a beer or a bite after, there were about 87 different bars and restaurants right across the street. Next time I'm in Austin, I know where I'm staying. "
,,,,,,,,Had a great time staying at Corey and Amanda's place. Extremely nice unit in the best neighborhood in Austin - highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,Awesome location direct in the rainey st where you can find nice bars and restaurants. The appartment in the millenium building is very nice with a touch of luxury. The staff at the desk is very friendly and helpful.
,,,,,,,,Corey and Amanda were great! Very accommodating and they made sure we had a great stay. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful apartment with plenty of space and high-end finishes, free parking, and all of Rainey Street literally right outside the front door -- what's not to love? Corey and Amanda sent over a comprehensive and easy check-in guide a few days before, and it couldn't have been more clear. This is a perfect listing in arguably the coolest part of Austin. I'd love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in great location right on Rainey St. Corey was great to deal with. Very responsive and helpful. He even provided a blow up mattress at short notice for an unexpected extra guest. Highly recommend. The beer and wine in the fridge on arrival was also a lovely touch.
,,,,,,,,"Corey and Amanda were very accommodating. I arrived early and they did their best to have me all checked in as soon as possible. The apartment was spotless and there were refreshments in the fridge. This wasn't my first time in Austin, but if it was I would have definitely used the map and sheet of Austin highlights that was set out on the kitchen counter. "
,,,,,,,,"Corey and Amanda were fantastic, made everything really easy and convenient. The space was beautiful and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,This apartment is a real great find perfectly located on Rainey Street and walking distance to everything. Communication with Corey and Amanda was perfect and they were super helpful even leaving us a few drinks for our arrival. They also went out of their way to help us with a parking pass for an extra night which was so nice of them. The apartment is very clean and modern with such a comfortable bed! We also used the lovely rooftop pool area to relax some afternoons. Thanks again would definitely recommend this place/come back! 
,,,,,,,,"Corey and Amanda were great hosts.  They provided everything we needed to know before checking in and answered every question we had quickly and thoroughly.  The condo was in a great location, easy to access, quiet and incredibly clean.  Parking in the garage was easy and made leaving the car behind to walk around downtown Austin easier than it would have been at a downtown hotel.  The building the condo is located in is brand new and feels incredibly safe.  All in all, I would certainly book this place again!"
,,,,,,,,This place was amazing and in such a great location! It was very clean and comfortable. Stayed here for a girls weekend and it was perfect for the two of us with plenty of space. The bathroom is huge! Corey and Amanda were so wonderful to work with. The check in and out process was so smooth. The pool area is amazing with wonderful views. Truly a spectacular place that we will use again if we come back to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Fantastic location and apartment! This is my new home away from home in Austin
,,,,,,,,"Host...very helpful and accomadating and friendly!  Condo perfect, had everything we needed. Location, location, location. Maybe the neighborhood could use low lighting on the streets. To see where you are walking."
,,,,,,,,"We had an absolutely amazing time staying in this place. Great apartment, great location, great amenities!!! Would recommend to any other travellers!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was awesome!  The location is in the heart of Rainey St., and also easily walkable to 6th Street.   There is a rooftop pool with a huge patio and grilling area.  The space itself is very comfortable with a nice kitchen (including dishes, cookware, etc...), huge dual sink bathroom, and comfortable living areas.  Parking was also a breeze, since you can park your car on the same floor as the apartment.  Corey & Amanda also responded to any questions I had right away.   I highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay at Corey & Amanda's place on Rainey Street immensely. The place was very clean, modern and in an unbeatable location. We also enjoyed the access to the gym upstairs in the building. Corey & Amanda were very responsive to all of our questions before and during our stay in Austin. Couldn't recommend this place more!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great stay. They did everything and then some to make sure our stay was comfortable. The location is perfect, the building was clean, the amenities were fantastic and the apartment was exactly as it was described. Could not recommend this space more highly!"
,,,,,,,,"One of our best Airbnb experiences! Corey and Amanda are pros at hosting!! They were extremely prompt with communication and on top of any questions we had. This space was clean, well designed and had all the amenities we needed for a great time. We were shocked with how quiet the apartment was at night! Awesome location on Rainey St and just a super short walk to E 4th and 6th. You will not be disappointed with this property! We hope to be back soon and have even checked out Corey and Amanda's other properties due to their awesome hosting skills and amazing attention to detail!! "
,,,,,,,,Corey and Amanda were amazing! The space us gorgeous and they make it so easy for you to check in/check out. I highly recommend this space to anyone wanting to stay near Rainey street or downtown Austin in general. We walked to the local bars and food trucks in less than a minute. They are great owners and me and my wife will definitely be back to enjoy this space again in the future! 
,,,,,,,,"This condo is AMAZING!  It was very clean, spacious, and the whole building was nice, including the rooftop pool and lobby area with coffee and tea.  Bars and restaurants are just a step out of the lobby door so the location is great.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment right in the heart of Rainey street. Couldn't have been better for what we were looking for. A cheaper alternative to a hotel in a great area. Two beds, slept four just fine. Nice balacony, and the garage parking was a nice bonus. Communication was seamless, as was check-in/check-out process. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location and hosts! Since the building was still finishing construction during our stay, the pool and fitness center were not accessible, but our hosts went out of their way to ensure that we were able to get access to one nearby. We plan to visit again in the near future and highly recommend it!"
8054795,4.5,10,10,10,9,10,9,"Awesome location, great attention, better than we could ask for"
,,,,,,,,"We found the location of the house to be wonderful. Close to many restaurants & shops and great bike riding. 
There is someone living upstairs so I would take that into consideration when booking this place. They don't seem to the be the most quiet all the time. 
Cozy spot, we stayed for two nights while on a roadtrip so for our purposes it was fine. "
,,,,,,,,Incredibly cute apartment in an awesome location. We would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,The Trip Shack was so homey I almost missed Austin because I just wanted to stay there.  It was so comfortable and quiet.  The unit is perfectly appointed and I love th artwork.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay with Lindsay was great. We were in town for one night, and she made it super easy. I'd definitely recommend this place if you are planning on going to ACL or SXSW. It was quiet, hidden and clean."
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay at the Downtown TripShack. Everything about it was adorable and perfect for 3 girls on a birthday trip. The location was great and easy to get to.
,,,,,,,,"The Downtown TripShack was exactly as the photos portrayed, fun and quirky! It was clean and comfortable with easy access to all the Austin venues. The outdoor garden was a wonderful place to unwind in the afternoon after a long day at the Formula One track. It truly felt like our home during our Austin stay."
,,,,,,,,"Great location for Austin, everything was there for what we needed. "
,,,,,,,,"Very clean and welcoming house. Check in was a breeze. Location is nice, close to everything but not right in it. Loved the outside space to hang out. The 2nd bed is a futon which wasn't super comfortable. And the cable package is pretty limited (no ESPN). The latter is not a big deal as we were out in Austin for most of the stay. Great value, would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,This was our first air bnb booking.  Early communication after booking helped ease my concerns about the process.  Everything went as expected.  Clear instructions made it easy.  The place was super cute and had everything we needed.  Even little things like scissors.  Felt very safe in the area.  Was a perfect location for biking to Zilker park and enjoying the Austin downtown scene.  Would definitely come back to the Trip Shack!
,,,,,,,,Overall great experience. The place is tucked away but still easily accessible to downtown Austin. Very clean and comfortable. I would consider staying here again. 
,,,,,,,,"The TripShack was great. Just a few minute cab ride into the downtown area of Austin (6th street). Very clean, comfortable bed and easy check-in. Lindsay was always quick to response, a great host. Overall a really pleasant experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Cozy little apartment right near downtown. Priced lower than the hotels, so it was a great deal! "
,,,,,,,,"The Tripshack was great! Exactly as pictured, super prime location. Patio was a total bonus! "
,,,,,,,,"The trip shack was a great, well located apartment near downtown and campus.  Clean and nicely decorated.  We had a minor plumbing issue and Lindsay had it taken care of immediately.  We'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Loved this place!  A clean and cozy space nestled away just outside of downtown.  Really couldnt ask for more.  Many thanks to our host for accomodating us on short notice.
,,,,,,,,"I loved this adorable, fun, clean and centrally located home. By car it took only 5 minutes with traffic to get to the UT campus and a couple of minutes more to get to Town Lake. Whole Foods is just under a mile away door-to-door. 

Another reviewer felt that the home was not in a ""walking neighborhood."" I disagree. Just across N. Lamar (a few steps away) is the beautiful Shoal Creek Trail which takes you all the way to and around Town Lake. At the trail entrance is a huge park with a basketball court, dog park/open field, play equipment and more. Perfect for the entire family. 

Though I only booked my stay two days in advance, everything was perfect upon arrival. The only downside to this property, is that the parking would be tricky for the elderly or physically challenged. The designated parking spot is on a hill which leaves your car at about a 45 degree angle, sideways. It is then a short but slightly steep climb up to the front door. There's also a neighbor upstairs who practices base guitar until about 11. It's Austin so that comes with the territory. 

I would absolutely recommend this place and hope to stay there again. 
"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first Airbnb experience so we were a little skeptical going in.  Lindsay's ratings seemed to speak for themselves, so we were ready to give TDTS a try.  Definitely wanted a place of our own - not sharing.  And we weren't just looking for a good location and cute Austin ""digs"", but most importantly wanted to feel safe/secure (traveling with teens).  The exterior lockable iron gate entrance which was a huge plus and eased our minds. The unit is nicely tucked away with other neighbors too. The interior courtyard area was great for storing our bikes, and a nice place to hang out at night when it was a little cooler outside.  Inside was perfect for the 3 of us.  The A/C kept us nice and chilled -necessary in Texas in July!!  No weird smells (for those of you who worry about that, including myself.)  Living/dining space perfect for watching TV (DirecTV- just like at home), playing games, eating a meal.  The fold-out leather futon was fine for our additional sleeper - not the most comfortable - but did the job. Kitchen has most everything you need; including a coffee maker (although not a Keurig :) and wine bottle corkscrew opener.  The bed and pillows were soooo comfortable!  The glow-in-the-dark Hendrix and Johnny Cash artwork was a fun surprise too!  Convenient  washer/dryer units, although we did not use during our short stay.  Bathroom is full of mirrors.  Small bath amenities a nice touch, but we brought our own. Would've been nice to have a light in the dark shower stall (but maybe we just didn't find the right switch). Renters Club service looks good/ convenient but we did not use.  Location-wise, it's a little tricky to get to TDTS - but once you figure it out the first time, you're good to go.  Straight shot down Lamar Street to get to 6th Street/downtown, or a little further south to Town Lake (Lady Bird)/Zilker Park.
My only complaint, (via foot or bike) we had to cross busy Lamar Street -with cars zooming by- to get to Pease Park (but once over there, Pokemon Go-ing with my teens was awesome!)  Also the Shoal Creek bike path was great until we came to a dead end because of downtown construction.  Our goal was to stay off the roads and on the bike path, so next time, we know to do our homework better. In a nutshell, would definitely stay here again. Good price for what you get too. Thank you!!
"
,,,,,,,,Loved the place! Great location. Perfect for a girls getaway!
,,,,,,,,"Cozy pad, with nice furnishings and great location.  Especially nice if you enjoy biking or running- shoal creek trails and lady bird lake in close proximity.. Easy communication with host and rental bike service was very easy to use! "
,,,,,,,,"This location was perfect for my work trip. Close enough to downtown, Whole Foods, REI, trails, etc but still felt tucked away and secluded. Space was clean with unique decor that made it less run-of-the-mill. Patio area was awesome and provided an additional layer of privacy and seclusion. The space was perfect for simple cooking and I even had room to roll my travel yoga mat out. The only downside was that it was a tad dark because it is in a highly wooded area.... But the wooded area made it more cozy and peaceful.. Trade offs!"
,,,,,,,,"The downtown Tripshack is a very convenient location, safe, and nicely decorated. While the neighborhood wasn't exactly walkable it was a short walk to a lot of nearby attractions. The hosting company was great with communication prior to our arrival.

Tripshack was clean, comfortable, and had all the amenities we could have asked for. Our only complaint was the sleeper sofa was a bit misleading... It fit two people but it was a squeeze and there was a bar in the middle - Two large people would not have fit. The main bed was very comfortable however. 

Overall would stay here again with a group of 4 or less for a quick Austin getaway. Thanks Tripshack!!"
,,,,,,,,"Very cute, comfortable, and quiet apartment. It was raining the entire time I was in Austin, so I was thankful there were umbrellas on hand!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a fabulous host!  I had shipped a package to the residence, and couldn't figure out where UPS had left it when I arrived.  Lindsay came out to the site, helped me track it down, and also helped clear up some parking confusion.  She was responsive and incredibly helpful.  "
,,,,,,,,"We had the best time in Austin, in large part thanks to Lindsay's trip shack! It was so close to downtown, the parks, and to the mopac- so it was easy to get to north Austin as well. It had everything we needed to make our stay cozy. And I liked having the choice of using the renters club concierge service as well. "
,,,,,,,,"We can always count on having a great experience with Lindsay and her rental properties. This is not the first time we have rented from Lindasy. She is always super helpful and has a great response rate. We loved the Trip Shack. It was exactly what we had hoped for. Location is great, All with the property was exactly as described.  I wouldn't hesitate to rent any of her properties. The quality of her rentals is top notch.   We look forward to our next visit to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The Tripshack was everything we hoped it would be. It's super cute with funky decor, spotlessly clean, exactly as described, and was perfectly equipped for visitors. The location is convenient for downtown, yet quiet and secluded. Access could not have been simpler and there is ample parking. We highly recommend it for singles, couples and families! 

(The only downside for us was the Renters Club who manage this property.  They did not adequately answer our questions on transport, telling us to get Uber from the airport even though I specifically asked for public transport, and it turns out there is a light rail straight to downtown and a fabulous bus system.  Kicker? There is currently no Uber in Austin.  I also asked for scooter rental and got a phone number of a shop which didn't return my call and had no scooters anyway, then the book of info they leave for visitors is lacking in lots of vital local information. No maps, no bus schedules, no addresses for grocery stores - but none of this marred our trip in any way, I'm only mentioning it to give others a heads up and that's why we have cell phones and internet, right?)

We would absolutely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,This was my first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. The space was perfect for a girls' weekend and felt like home for our Austin getaway. We will definitely be back!!
,,,,,,,,"House was great, very convenient to downtown, made it easy to relax and enjoy my time in Austin"
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome!  We had a great stay in Austin in this little bungalow.  Its right off the beaten path but a very short Uber ride to anywhere in the city.  We were very comfortable here and would come back!  Also, the Renters Club was very accommodating to us, given that there was a snowstorm in Denver on our return and we needed a little extra help with storing our luggage for the afternoon.  Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,10/10 place was awesome.  had everything the listing said it had.  highly recommend this place.  
,,,,,,,,"Lovely place, we felt close enough to the action and far enough away in our apartment."
,,,,,,,,"This was a well located property and great for a couple.  It had all of the necessities and was very clean.  

There is a cute little patio in the ground floor entry, a large screen tv in the living room/dining room.  The kitchen is fully outfitted and the bathroom had a great hair dryer.

I can't say that we spent a lot of time in the apartment, but it was quiet and was quite walkable."
,,,,,,,,"Very quick to respond to questions I had. The place was awesome and exactly as described. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good location in a quieter area. We walked to the bars on 6th street. It was a bit of a hike. Uber is minimal cost, $5. 
Just a perfect place for us to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"The Downtown TripShack was amazing. Great location, perfect for SXSW. The place is very clean and organized. Super quiet and neighbors are friendly. I will definitely look up Lindsay when I visit Austin again. "
,,,,,,,,We had such a nice stay at the TripShack! This is a fantastic and fun space with a great centralized location! We really enjoyed exploring Austin and the stay at the TripShack was very nice! 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was extremely helpful and kind upon our arrival to Austin! We loved the tripshack- it felt like home to us during our stay in the Austin area. We will definitely come back and when we do, the tripshack will be first on our list for places to stay. "
,,,,,,,,"The stay at Lindsay's place was phenomenal! We arrived really late in the evening so the lock-box and door key code made it super easy to get settled in. The place was spotless and had everything you might need during a visit (sheets for the pull out sofa, plenty of towels, cleaning supplies, kitchen supplies, etc.). Though we spent a lot of time exploring the city, the TripShack was a great place to come and relax in-between activities. I especially loved the enclosed patio - a great place to enjoy a drink.

The location was exactly as advertised - close to anything you'd want to do in Austin. It never took more than 2 minutes to hail a Lyft driver and it's also only a 5 minute walk from an awesome greenway that goes down to the riverfront area.

Overall we had an incredible experience and I would highly recommend the location to anyone looking to visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Lindsey replied to my messages right away and was extremely attentive to our concerns. She made us feel welcome and was always courteous and attentive. Thanks!!
,,,,,,,,"The Trip Shack was amazing!  Such a lovely, roomy apartment with great outdoor space conveniently located near downtown. Apartment was clean, with all the basic amenities provided.  I didn't rent a car, but Uber in Austin is GREAT and so cheap (~$6 a ride anywhere I wanted to go)"
,,,,,,,,"I didn't have any interactions with Lindsay, but the place was great! Very clean and comfortable, just as pictured in the photos. The location is perfect, just blocks from Whole Foods and Waterloo Records, easy to get to parks and across the river as well. Thanks so much for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,Great location! Very convenient to go to downtown or to north Austin. The Interior and furniture are just like the photos. The only drawback is the house is on top of a steep hill so parking was a little scary and there is limited lighting outside the house and the surrounding area. 
,,,,,,,,We were introduced to the renters club which was helpful.
,,,,,,,,"A great place to stay! The location was great- we could walk to 6th Street, the UT campus, and running trails. Lindsay and the Renters Club were easy to communicate with, and responded quickly to my emails and phone calls. The wifi was not working when we arrived, but the problem was resolved when I called. The bed was very comfortable, and the kitchen had all the dishes we needed. We had two adults sleeping on the sleeper sofa, which was a little too crowded. "
,,,,,,,,"My Stay at the Trip Shack was absolutely wonderful! The space is clean, cozy and decorated so cute it makes you feel at home. 

Lindsay was print in her response and The Renter's Club was great with any and all questions which made it simple and eased my mind while traveling. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's property is conveniently located, close to CVS, whole foods, UT Austin. Check-in was easy, and the property is just as pictured! AC works well, and there are ceiling fans to cool down the rooms if needed. Two designated parking spots go with the unit (as long as the neighbors don't take it). The property is located in a more foresty area, and there are cockroaches in the area, so you will find some in your unit as well! Overall, Lindsay's quick to respond, the location is good, check in is easy, property is beautiful."
,,,,,,,,"The TripShack has been our favorite Airbnb stay so far. It was so cozy with a great layout. The bedroom was dark and we couldn't hear any of the neighbors. We felt very much at home and had everything we needed for our stay. The front porch was super cute and we were bummed we were too busy to have breakfast out there. I would love to stay at the TripShack again or check out one of the other properties. 

My favorite upside was that rentals and other amenities were available. We were thinking about renting bikes but decided to walk to ACL since we weren't sure about navigating. I loved that that was an option. 

We only had to text Lindsay once because both parking lots were occupied by other people. She texted us back right away and sent someone over to clear the spaces. Early on in our reservation Lindsay also confirmed we were good to go, because other AirBnB hosts kept cancelling on us once they realized they overbooked or it was ACL weekend. That really eased our minds and made us super appreciative for a professional and honest host. 

And location. Seriously, awesome location. Right off Lamar so we were close to everything. We were a $5 Lyft from downtown and ACL.  GREAT STAY."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host. The place was clean and well represented. When we went to make up the second bed at 11pm Friday night we realized there were no linens. I contacted Lindsay and she ran some right over. Now, that's what I call service! Thanks for the great stay at the Tripshack!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a really good time in this apartment. The place was lovely - comfortable, spacious and equipped with everything we needed for our overnight stay (including recommendations about restaurants etc. in Austin). We received all the details we needed and we were even able to leave the car in the parking space for a few hours after we checked out. Overall a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was super convenient, we were just a few minutes drive from everywhere we wanted to be. It was super cute and hip! We recommend it to folks traveling to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The TripShack was very comfortable and in a very private and quiet location. 
,,,,,,,,"The place was easy to find, located in a great neighborhood with lots of amenities, and Lindsay was super helpful with any questions we had.  As local Austinites, this place was a gem that we chose as our ""anniversary getaway"" and it did not disappoint.  We'd absolutely stay again.  "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful location that you wouldn't expect to find a condo in. Cute place with good spaces for hanging out and for sleep
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was incredible! Lindsay was extremely attentive through the whole process, the apartment was perfect (just enough outside of downtown to be free of major traffic and feel like a true bnb), and was very reasonably priced given its location to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, and had everything that we needed to cook at home and to have a cup of coffee in the morning! "
,,,,,,,,Staying at Lindsay's place was awesome! Great location close to downtown that was a quick uber ride to all the hot spots. Would highly recommend to stay here!

,,,,,,,,This was a perfect airbnb for a few day stay in Austin. Close to Rainey street and walkable to downtown. Loved it!
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"This is a really nice house. Everything is there, the bed are really good and near to 6th street. Easy to park your car over there. Definitely worth for what you pay!"
,,,,,,,,"Alaina's place was definitely clean and walkable, it checked the boxes but do take note that the walk to
Downtown does have areas without sidewalks and cuts under the highway, so walking here at night can be a bit shady. The apartment also shares a wall with neighbors and if they are home when you are it's quite easy to hear them. No television or microwave, we never had any leftovers but I imagine most would expect a microwave and a television would have been nice to drown out the neighbors. We happened to visit during a cold spell and the hot water seemed to be a bit lacking when we'd take showers back to back. The place was definitely nice and clean and had the weather been nicer the outdoor patio would have been awesome. "
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Alaina's place. The apartment was very clean. Alaina's communication was clear and responsive. The apartment's location is great in terms of walkability. It only takes 10 minutes or so to walk to downtown where there are many things to do. If you're willing to do this walk while carrying your luggage, you can even get to Alaina's from the airport for just a couple of dollars by taking a bus from the airport to downtown.

I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,It was a very nice place. We enjoyed it. 
,,,,,,,,Alaina was very easy to communicate with and quick to offer suggestions for exploring the city. Nice house and great location.

,,,,,,,,"Alaina was an awesome host! Showed us where everything was, great location, and very very nice outside patio. Definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment and location are perfect! An easy walk to 6th Street, Juan in a Million, Texas' first cat cafe, and great coffee spots. Really enjoyed the neighborhood!"

Beautiful space, easy walking distance to downtown/6th Street.

,,,,,,,,"Alaina was very helpful and accommodating, and the apartment was very clean. We had a great time, great value and location! "

,,,,,,,,Great airbnb experience. Alaina was super responsive and her place was exactly what was advertised. 
,,,,,,,,"This place was super cute, cozy, and very comfortable.  Alaina was super easy to work with for arrival/departure instructions, and was great about checking in to see how our stay was going.  This place was perfect and all we needed for a weekend getaway.
A quick 10-15 minute walk to downtown, and in a quiet neighborhood away from the 6th Street crazy.

Thank for the hospitality!"
,,,,,,,,We booked Alaina's place last minute for one more night in ATX and we really enjoyed our stay.  She was super easy to work with and left us great directions to orient us on using her place. Her place was very clean and quaint.  Very comfortable and nicely decorated. The location is fantastic too for East side attractions.  We felt totally safe in the neighborhood at night.  Would book again for sure.
,,,,,,,,Wonderful little home and Alaina was a great host. The location couldn't be better and the house has all the amenities one needs for a comfortable stay.
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful
 time staying in Austin at Alaina's comfortable home. The place was perfect for us to bike and walk to Austin City Limits and plenty of nearby restaurants and bars, including the great cafe Alaina recommended called Cenote which we went to a few times! The backyard seating area which she landscaped was fun and she even left us a bottle of wine. We would definitely recommend staying here if you're passing through Austin!
"
,,,,,,,,"I loved the place and the location!  Alaina's place was super clean and quaint.  Her place is located in a super convenient location, walking distance to the convention center, downtown and fun bars and restaurants on the east side. One thing that makes her place unique and special being close to both downtown and also east side which is full of fun things! Alaina was easy to communicate, super friendly and very helpful.  Next time I have friends in town who need a place I would definitely reserve her place again. By the way, the patio is so lovely!"

Ali sent a list of instructions for check in and made it very clear where to park and how to get to the apartment! Highly recommend staying here for an amazing experience in Austin"
,,,,,,,,"Ali's place was super clean and decorated so cool. Everything in this area was very modern and state of the art. Even the on site gym was loaded with lots of machines and equipment. It's very close to city life and park areas so we never had to travel far. We actually walked to Zilker Park. The only down side would be that it wasn't quiet, but she is very upfront about that in her description. We were looking for a city experience, so it really didn't bother us at all. You get used to it really quick. Highly recommend this place! "
,,,,,,,,The place was so ideal! Comfortable and well taken care of. Ali was incredibly descriptive and provided everything we needed. Thank you so much. Had a great time.

Thanks for being so easy to communicate with and for making such a great few days possible."

,,,,,,,,"Ali's place was great! It's in a cool area that is surrounded by great restaurants and plenty of things to do. Our highlights were: ramen at Tatsuya, Rainy st. bars, and walking through Zilker park. Her place was clean and we definitely enjoyed the Casper mattress (so much better than the mattress at the Omni downtown)."
,,,,,,,,"Ali was super responsive throughout the whole process. We had some question whether it would be ok for our toddler, and Ali was clear and honest in her response. We decided to go ahead and it worked out perfectly. Couldn't ask for a better location in Austin (with parking, to boot!)."

She's a great host!"
,,,,,,,,"Ali was very responsive and warm. Her place was in prime location (for you night owls: restaurants in the area would close early which isn't a complaint against the place but a FYI).

The cabinet supplies and treats were a great addition."
,,,,,,,,First time using Airbnb and we loved Ali's place and she was a fantastic hostess! 
,,,,,,,,Ali is very nice and responds very quickly. Her apartment has a great location and is perfect for 2 people. The only downside I found was that there wasn't a TV. But other than that I have no complaints.

,,,,,,,,"Ali's apartment was perfect for a weekend getaway for my husband and me. Parking, access, and key handoff was seamless.

,,,,,,,,"Beautiful apartment in a great part of town, we used Allison's recommendations multiple times and she never steered us wrong.  The apartment complex also comes with free parking which was very useful.   "
,,,,,,,,"Allison was a WONDERFUL host! I stayed at her place with 3 friends during Austin City Limits, and we had the best time. Ali was really responsive via email and made herself available to us via phone/text while we were in Austin. She was so informative before we arrived, though, that we didn't need to be in touch at all while we were in town. The apartment was extremely clean and had all the necessary items for a great stay. There was plenty of room for 4 people, and the air mattress that Ali provided was really comfortable. Her Air Bnb description definitely matched the place. She left us recommendations for bars and restaurants around the area. We LOVED the neighborhood! It was an easy 20 minute walk to Zilker Park for the festival which was so convenient. I definitely recommend staying  there for ACL.  We especially loved taking advantage of the awesome rooftop pool with an amazing view of Austin. Truly I have no complaints about our experience or our host. Thanks again, Ali! :) "
,,,,,,,,"Allison's place was perfect for a weekend getaway! The apartment was beautiful and spacious, exactly how it looks in the photos. The pool went above and beyond our expectations as well.

I had a few questions during my stay and the host quickly responded. I definitely recommend staying here."

5371233,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Mari's place is in the perfect location to walk to anywhere in downtown Austin. I would stay here again anytime I come to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Mari's condo is in the perfect location for our visit to the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas. The bus transfer pickup was one block from the building and all the downtown activity was within easy walking distance.

The apartment was spotlessly clean and well stocked with linens and basic kitchen essentials. Mari was very responsive during the reservation and arrivals process.

I have no reservation whatsoever in recommending this condo to others visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great spot
,,,,,,,,Great location! 
,,,,,,,,"Mari was very responsive and worked back and forth with me as we hammered out the details. She even admitted upfront that the location can be noisey, being right in the heart of downtown Austin (it really wasn't that bad at all!).  The place is fantastic, especially for couples or a few friends staying in Austin, wanting to be in the center of everything. I live in Austin, but rented Mari's place out for friends visiting in town, so I'll add my austinite credibility here and say this is a great place to stay if you want to immerse yourself in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect Bed and breakfast. walking distance to everything (trails, electric bike company, Rainy St, 6th St, Barton Springs). Mari always communicated and even let us get into the condo slightly early after our flights arrived. Great experience! Highly recommend! "

The pictures don't do it justice and the location was super convenient (especially if you're in town for a conference at the Austin Convention Center which is a 3~4 minute walk away). It's also only a couple of blocks away from 6th so we had plenty of options for great restaurants and bars.

Mari was responsive (although we didn't really need much since everything was ready for us) and getting in and out of the place was very convenient."

,,,,,,,,"Mari was a great host and the condo was gorgeous! Her assistant was easily accessible and made sure we got into the condo okay.  It was a close 2 walk block from 6th street where all the action was!

Everything about the experience was great! Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"Mari's place was in great condition and just as pictured! Our arrival and link up was extremely flexible, the place was very easy to access with coded gates and door, and we were even welcomed with a stocked refrigerator. Great location with balcony overlooking 4th St. and walking distance to everything you could need. Only issue we had was that although we could see the wifi on the network list, it didn't work for the entire duration of our stay. Other than that, no issues and I would definitely recommend. Thanks Mari!"
,,,,,,,,"This condo is located in downtown and it's perfect for SXSW.  The host Mari was helpful and professional, and she even left some food in the fridge for us.  The condo was clean, beautiful and in great condition, and the towels, linens and other items in the condo seemed brand new.   I would highly recommend this condo for a downtown location in Austin!

,,,,,,,,Apartment was great. Dave and lance are super responsive hosts which made the whole process easy. Would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Everything about our stay was great. Lance and Lawrence were able to accommodate us a bit earlier too which was great.  The location was close to everything, especially Tiff's Treats which is a must-stop. The apartment was real cozy with so much natural sunlight throughout. We weren't inside too much during the day but it proved to be a great escape from the heat during our breaks. They have an amazing assortment of books and DVDs. If we ever find ourselves in Austin, I'll looking out for this place first."
,,,,,,,,Very nice experience! Highly recommended
,,,,,,,,"It was definitely a pleasant experience staying at Lance's apartment. The place is spacious, cozy and convenient. The location is awesome, very close to UT Austin campus and easy access to city bikes. It's also just few minutes to downtown Austin. On top of that, Lance is a very nice host. He is very responsive and always answer my questions right away. I highly recommend Lance's home if you come to visit Austin :) I will definitely stay here again if I come to visit Austin again. "
,,,,,,,,"David's place is large and airy, and well-located within walking distance of the UT campus and Capitol Hill. He was kind enough to accept our reservation with less notice than we'd have liked when our previous host cancelled at the last minute, and we found the place great for our needs. He was also understanding when we left some things (chargers) behind! "
,,,,,,,,David was great and very helpful prior to our stay. The apartment was perfect for the weekend visit. Very clean and close to nightlife. Key pick up and drop off was easy and made the trip that much better!

,,,,,,,,"David was great. I arrived a little late and left very early, and he was very accommodating both times. This apartment is only a couple of blocks from the AT&T Conference Center on the UT campus, which made it really convenient and a bargain. David makes it feel like you're crashing at a friend's placeâ€”he has a 'help yourself to anything' policy of sortsâ€”except you get the bed instead of the couch. "
,,,,,,,,David was a great host. There were no issues and he tried to make our trip as hassle-free and convenient as possible. Very accommodating. I loved the set up of the apartment. It was spaciously fitting for my large group of friends. We uber/lyfted and walked. I enjoyed the location because it wasn't too close to downtown that we were in the commotion during South by Southwest but we were close enough that  hopping in the car wasn't an issue. 
,,,,,,,,"David is a wonderful host. Very generous in all ways. He also accommodated our last minutes changes, which was thoughtful of him. The flat is spacious and a short Uber from most things you'd want to see. I'd recommend staying there. "

I would recommend this house to anyone visiting and would like to stay when I'm back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Loved Brad's place! The bungalow was in great shape. Light and airy and the two bedrooms were spacious. The kitchen was great and well stocked - we made a huge breakfast and had all the pots/pans/etc. that we needed. 

Location was great, although we still ended up driving a fair bit to get to places. West 6th is about a 20 minute walk, so definitely doable!

We had a few questions about the place prior to our stay and Brad/Sean were always very quick to respond and helpful with their answers! All in all, I would highly recommend. "

The apartment is situated in a great area (I can see this being ideal for ACL), and includes a parking spot right in front of the unit.  William left water and snacks for us, an easy to reference instruction sheet (WiFi, TV, etc), and offers recommendations for places to hit in the area.

Even came in to a small treat in the fridge! =) Very thankful that I found this air bnb! Will absolutely stay again anytime I come to Austin if I'm lucky enough it's open!"
,,,,,,,,"Steven/Brook were great with communication. Made check-in easy and even gave us a late checkout. The place was as described. Well appointed and comfortable. There are stairs to get to the unit, which wasn't an issue for us, but could be an issue for somebody with mobility issues. "

The fatasctic accomodation contributed to our great time in Austin. Thank you Steven and Brook!
,,,,,,,,Condo worked out perfectly for a business trip to Austin.  Location was excellent - walking distance to most locations and easy access to downtown.  The condo is well maintained and had everything I needed for my stay.
,,,,,,,,"Had an enjoyable long weekend at this charming downtown condo. The condo is on the top floor, simple, and clean. The bed and couch were comfortable and the place had all the main amenities needed. We felt at home and comfortable here. A good place to wind down at night and relax. It was easy to find and only about a mile from the heart of downtown. Several small restaurants, bars, yoga studios, parks, and shops near by. The neighborhood was quiet, relaxed, and safe. Steven and Brook responded to any of our questions or concerns quickly and professionally. I would highly recommend this place and would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful little condo in a nice neighborhood.  First off, the condo is great.  It's artistically decorated to giving the place a nice vibe, and the added bonus of the pool was refreshing.  Because the neighborhood is on West 6th you don't have to worry about the nighttime craziness that the downtown crowd has to offer.  Steven did a wonderful job reviewing many of the local restaurants in the area which made finding a great meal easy.  I'll definitely look to stay here again when I'm back in town."
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay at Steven's condo! It was a great location -- easy walk to Sixth street and all it has to offer.

,,,,,,,,"We booked Steven's modern 1 BD condo for an extended stay in Austin over the summer and everything worked out better than perfect. The unit was just as described, our hosts were attentive and responsive, but never overbearing, and the location was perfectly for our use. Our hosts provided lots of recommentations about Austin and we took full advantage of their local knowledge. Our stay was outstanding and steven's place played a huge part in that. Very highly recommended property and hosts.   "

The condo is in a great location, close enough to downtown but still quiet and relaxing.  There is a Whole Foods within walking distance and LOTS of shops, restaurants within 3-4 blocks of the condo.  The condo is in great shape, clean, organized and comfortable.  We definitely enjoyed our stay here and highly recommend!  "
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed our stay in Steven's condo.  Everything was clean and comfortable as well as nicely decorated.  Steven was a very helpful and gracious host.  Would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is really nice, clean and has a lot of great facilities (TV, Netflix, stereo, internet). Also, you have a private parking space just outside the building. Steve was very helpful and provided us with tips and info about things to do and places to eat, but also everything you would need to know about the apartment. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Steven's condo was perfect for our sxsw homebase. We had 4 people and the only downside was that the couch in the living room was really only suitable for one person, or maybe a couple if they don't mind sleeping very close at night.  Otherwise it was a terrific location, walkable to downtown or a cheap cab ride, and felt very safe even late at night. There were plenty of towels and bedding and it was very clean. We didn't have a chance to use the pool but it looked great. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Steven's place is great. My parent's stayed to be within walking distance of Whole Foods.  Steven gave them easy instructions, the place was very clean, and he even left a basket full of different soaps and shampoos to use if they needed it.  Definitely recommend."

The internet went in and out throughout the weekend and the TV did not work but we didn't spend much time in the apartment. Overall, would definitely recommend for a fair-priced place with parking. "
,,,,,,,,Nichole's place was great!  As soon as we walked through the gate we loved it!  It was in a perfect location and everything was as pictured. We'll definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"There was no wifi or cable as advertised. Nichole said she was on the phone with Time Warner and they would get if fixed. She even said to expect them to contact me to come fix it. That did not happen and I do not believe it was really going to happen based on some previous reviews I read. 

Place was clean.

No amenities that you normally get in AirBnB's spices, jams, sauces. It was very sterile. 

I will find other places when I visit Austin in the future. "
,,,,,,,,This was a great stay! Worth every penny! Great location and very clean. I've only ever had one experience with Airbnb and it was terrible and I swore I'd never do it again but my friend who was on this trip loves Airbnb and now I can see why. This unit is clearly renovated and much newer than the others. Parking wasn't a problem. VERY CLEAN!! Nichole is very nice and responsive and she gave us the wifi name and password upfront but the only downside is we couldn't find it when trying to connect. We didn't reach out cause we were only staying a night and it didn't really matter. Not a big deal. 
,,,,,,,,I would not recommend staying at this place unless you are in contact with the host. She never responded back to any of my questions and never answered my phone calls. Had to book a hotel room because we couldn't get into contact. 
,,,,,,,,This was a great place to stay.  Check in and out were flexible which was wonderful.  The place is adorable.  It's well decorated and spotless.  It was just what we needed for our night in Austin.  Nichole was great communicating with us as well.  The location was fantastic.  Such a great part of Austin and so close to so many great restaurants and things to do in this great city.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thanks!
,,,,,,,,Everything was lovely.  What a great place.

,,,,,,,,Great stay - thanks Neal!
,,,,,,,,"The house was located in a great location just a short walk to downtown, to see all that Austin has to offer.  The hosts were extremely friendly and made sure that are stay was comfortable.  For example, when we lost the key Neal (The Host) answered his phone late at night and let us in right away!  The house was very homey, overall it was fantastic welcoming stay. I am very thankful."
,,,,,,,,"Smooth, clean,close to downtown and convention center, and super low key. Perfect for single or couple travel"
,,,,,,,,"We felt very welcome and Neal was a good communicator. The location is great and was in a very safe area. Super cheap Fasten ride to 6th street. 

Only issue we had was that the walls seemed to be pretty thin so they heard us one night coming home from the bar and we also heard them in the mornings getting ready for work. "
,,,,,,,,GREAT LOCATION!!!! AWESOME HOSTS!!!! Definitely I will be back.
,,,,,,,,"Neal and Tyler was very warm and accommodating. Neal was easy to communicate with and responsive to our needs, even when away from the house. Our room and bathroom was clean and tidy. The neighborhood is safe, quiet and in a central location that makes it easy to get around the city. They allowed us access to our bikes which we used to take the pedestrian trail next to their house. The trail was an amazing experience. After a week of staying there, the house felt like a second home."
,,,,,,,,"Neal and his girlfriend Tyler were amazing hosts! They always made us feel completely at home and welcome to use the shared living and kitchen areas. We stayed at their place for a week and Neal and Tyler were great about recommending places to go and things to do. If Neal was heading out about the same time as us he was also happy to give us a lift if he was going in the same direction which was much appreciated! We had a great time at their place and would definitely stay again if we were back in Austin
The house is pretty close to downtown and there is good public transport for most of the things to do in Austin"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay with Neal was terrific! He and Tyler definitely made us feel at home and were so friendly/accommodating. The room was comfortable, clean and exactly like the description.

My boyfriend and I came into Austin for a weekend getaway and they were welcoming and always accmommodating to our needs the entire time! The house was lovely and the perfect size for a relaxing enjoyable stay. Thanks for making our trip so memorable! <3 "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Cat made the best out of our rainy weekend. This is my second time as a guest in their home and I know if I were to visit Austin again I definitely need to stay with them. As always they were very welcoming and would timely check in to see if we needed anything. They recommended amazing places to visit and truly salvaged our rained out weekend.

Thank you Patrick and Cat! "
,,,,,,,,Absolutely wonderful visit! Separate living and sleeping area- you can knock on the door between their space and your space and chat or ask for help any time! Catherine and Patrick are a well travelled couple with plenty of good stories and recommendations for your future travels! They are very enjoyable friendly people and their house is a perfect bungalow style home close to everything but still feels scenic and out of the hustle and bustle of town- even though it's only a few minutes walk to it all! And we really appreciated the affordability of the space- much more space then you'll find anywhere for that price! So we had funds for the visit and we were thankful to have found such an incredible space for such a reasonable price!
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay here. Patrick and Catherine were so friendly and made us feel at home. Their place is awesome and they have great recommendations of things to do in the neighboring area. They made sure our stay was perfect. Would stay here again without any hesitation. 
,,,,,,,,"My sister and I had a wonderful stay with Catherine and Patrick! The house is beautiful (pictures don't do it justice) but it's Catherine and Patrick's Hospitality that sets them apart from other hosts. They were 
very accommodating with our check-in time and greeted us with a warm welcome. Catherine very kindly would check in on us through out our stay, to make sure we had everything we needed and were comfortable. Patrick and Catherine offered lots of recommendations on places to eat and local attractions and were very helpful with directions and the best ways to get around town. 
Their neighborhood is beautiful and friendly, with lots of local gems. Their home is clean, comfortable and we felt like we were at home. Overall, a wonderful stay! "
,,,,,,,,Very welcoming. Great neighborhood!
,,,,,,,,"The experience was great. Description was accurate, environment was welcoming and a wonderfully quiet neighborhood. Would definitely recommend Patrick and Catherine as hosts. "
,,,,,,,,"IsÃ¤ntÃ¤  Patrick ja Catherine olivat erittÃ¤in ystÃ¤vÃ¤llisiÃ¤. Auttoivat monissa asioissa jo etukÃ¤teen. MyÃ¶hÃ¤isen saapumisen vuoksi, he olivat vastaanottamassa vielÃ¤ puolen yÃ¶n tietÃ¤millÃ¤. Hintakin oli sovellettu ekalla pÃ¤ivÃ¤lle paremmaksi. YleisiÃ¤ kulkuneuvoja kÃ¤yttÃ¤en pÃ¤Ã¤si kulkemaan pienellÃ¤ kÃ¤velyllÃ¤ helposti. Taksi 6th Streetille maksoi 7,5 taalaa. Yksi hieno lisÃ¤pointti oli, ettÃ¤ he pesivÃ¤t pyykkimmekin. Kiitos 6 rauhallisesta yÃ¶pymisestÃ¤."
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were wonderful - such sweet, kind people! They were there if I had questions or needed something, but gave me my privacy too. It was the perfect balance. It was the small things that made it such a nice stay - like Catherine kept the mini fridge stocked with water. The space was perfect! I had a bedroom, bathroom, and living room with a separate entrance. Everything was kept impeccably clean. The house is about a 25-30 minute walk from downtown. It's the perfect location to experience Austin, while still staying in a quiet area. Graffiti Park is a short walk from their house. Definitely a cool place to check out - go early on a weekday if possible. Overall, fantastic experience for my first Airbnb. Definitely will stay with Patrick and Catherine again!"
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine not only provided a comfortable home environment, they were engaging and thoughtful.  The neighborhood is about as good as it can be in Austin, especially if being just outside the center of the action is an interest."
,,,,,,,,"We arrived earlier than check in time but were greeted warmly by Catherine and Patrick who had assured us earlier that our early arrival would be no problem. The guest area is connected to the main house by a door which they kept closed but knocked on once a day to make sure we had everything we needed and give us recommendations. It was great having them right there but also feeling like our space was private! Catherine kept the mini fridge stocked with water and washed our towels, Pat gave us the best directions for getting around town and they both shared their obvious enthusiasm for Austin with us. The house is located in a quiet, very cute area about 10-15 minutes walking distance from the Whole Foods as well as shopping and restaurants downtown and about 40 minutes walking distance to Zilker Park which made our stay very convenient. They're lovely people with a beautiful home and we will stay with them again!"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience staying with Patrick and Catherine was a delight. They are a friendly and easygoing couple, and the private space they provide to guests is clean and well-appointed. It is about a 20-minute walk to downtown Austin, and there are many nice places to visit in the neighborhood. We weren't able to visit with them much due to a short stay, but we would have loved to have had the time. In our experience, they really care about doing a good job for their guests!"
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were very flexible in dealing with our arrival time on Thursday night. They had great recommendations around town, and a gorgeous house. All in all, this was a great Air BnB experience!"
,,,,,,,,Catherine and Patrick's home is lovely and comfortable. The couple has set up a private area of guests and made the stay quite comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,"A wonderful perch for an Austin first-timer -- and, I'd say, for anyone else. Patrick and Catherine could not have been more hospitable, nor their spotless place more comfortable. It's in a terrific residential neighborhood that's a pleasant walk away from downtown, weather permitting, with a coffee place, restaurant, drugstore, and other conveniences right around the corner. A great place to taste the flavor of Austin living. "
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine were very accommodating and gracious hosts. We were glad to find a quiet space so near downtown at a reasonable price. 
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine are like the sweet Aunt and Uncle who let their nieces and nephews stay at their house because the kids want freedom, but also need the wisdom and support of two wise souls. The whole front of the house is basically yours. The room is a good size with a large bookcase full of classics like Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" and French cook books. It's a classic, comfortable feel. The bed is so soft, it feels like a hammock! I slept like a rock.

Patrick and Catherine have installed a door between the front and back of the house to give guests privacy. You have your own mini-fridge that they keep stocked with water bottles. There's a coffee maker and coffee grinds, a dinner table for 4, and your own bathroom with a clean shower. If you prefer privacy, it's yours. I stayed for ~a week, so I got to kno(URL HIDDEN)little bit. We had several nice conversations, including once sitting out on their back porch sipping wine and trading stories about world travel. (PS: I'm 33 and they are retired.) It was totally comfortable. But they'll only chat with you if you show interest (I did bc I was more living than traveling).

This is NOT a party house. If you plan to get drunk and stumble home, it'll be like doing that to your sweet Aunt and Uncle. This place is PERFECT for couples (or singles) of any age who want to explore Austin like a local. The neighborhood is super convenient with a popular coffee shop nearby (I'm here now), several cafe restaurants, a fresh market, and a couple fancy restaurants.

Location: safe, neighborly, and a 25 minute walk to downtown (5 min drive)."
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I came in to see our daughter who lives in Austin. Patrick and Catherine could not have been more gracious and accommodating. The place was clean, comfortable and absolutely wonderful. We will be back again!!"
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine were very sweet and accommodating. I would recommend the stay to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine were extremely hospitable. One of the most beautiful historic residential properties I've been in and a relaxing place to cozy up for the weekend. Best part is that so many destinations for food and exercise are walkable that it makes the stay there a no brainer! Amazing experience! I will definitely look them up again to stay at next time I need a BNB in ATX. 
,,,,,,,,"This was such a nice place to stay! We had a lot of space to ourselves and it was very comfortable and clean. They have a really nice house. Great location, in a quiet neighbourhood but close to everything. I would definitely stay here again. Catherine and Patrick are lovely people who made us feel right at home. They gave us lots of Austin tips and even some for the rest of the road trip."
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine have a lovely home in a quiet area that's very close to downtown. They were lovely hosts :) They gave us loads of information and advice on places to see. I can only recommend them to anyone. Great stay!
,,,,,,,,"All 5 stars for Patrick and Catherine. Their place is actually better than it looks here. Clean and spacious in a lovely neighborhood close to the bigger downtown Austin and also the smaller ""downtown"" Clarkesville. Being unfamiliar with the city, they were very helpful and available to answer all my questions. One of the best stays I've had so far. Patrick and Catherine make you feel like a guest in their home. I especially appreciated the fridge of bottled water as temps reached 105 one of the days I was there!"
,,,,,,,,Catherine and Patrick are very warm inviting host's. They were very accommodating. Was a pleasure to stay with them. 
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were greats hosts. Great price, very friendly and helpful/informative, clean room with everything I needed. Even provided water in the mini fridge. 

The room and living area are towards the front of the house and they occupy the back end. Don't be afraid to give a sturdy knock on the door when you need them since they have things to do during the day.  Graciously allowed to wash a couple of times since I accidentally left a few things at home.

Location is awesome!

Will definitely try to book again next time I am in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a lovely stay at Patrick and Catherine's home over the weekend. They are extraordinarily warm, communicative, and welcoming people (typical of Austin!). Their house is great and provides enough privacy to the extent that you feel like you have a place of your own. Location is also a plus - a short ride away from downtown with an array of walkable restaurant options as well. Couldn't have asked for more!"
,,,,,,,,"Great residence, hosts, and neighborhood! The room was very private and had its own entry. I was very comfortable, and had no problems! Highly suggest staying at Patrick and Catherine's. "
,,,,,,,,They are wonderful hosts!  The house is gorgeous and peaceful.  We really enjoyed our stay.  I definitely recommend staying here!  
,,,,,,,,"We love Clarksville and found Patrick and Catherine's place to be just what we needed for our long family reunion weekend.   They are lovely hosts who could not have been any more gracious.  They communicated so promptly, were so welcoming and helpful, and ensured that all our needs were met.  The bedroom was comfy and well-appointed, a lovely bathroom, and a whole living room area to enjoy, too.  Super clean, too!  If you don't know Austin and would like a quiet, residential home experience with easy and quick access to great neighborhood hangouts (Josephines, yum! and Caffe Medici for coffee, yum!, plus near Lamar etc), with nice hosts, this is for you!  We would definitely return!  "
,,,,,,,,The listing did not tell me that this couple would be staying there the same time. 
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience staying here. They were very friendly and willing to help with anything we needed and will give you your privacy if needed. Great location 10 minutes walk from west 6th. Clean quiet and safe area. Would stay there the whole summer if I could. 
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick, you did it again.  But this time it was better.  Haha!  You have such a special little bungalow and it's so clean!  The floors are immaculate and there is not a spec of dust anywhere.  This stay I noticed even more special touches in the apartment, like great choice of paint colors, interesting molding, classic art and books.  The sleeps I had were some of the best ever.  It's so quiet in that house!  Love it!! And I will be back...if you will have me! Until next time!"
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were amazing and their house was lovely. We had a great stay and will definitely try to stay again if we make our way back to Austin. The house is very clean, pleasant, and both hosts are extremely friendly. They offered suggestions for food and activities to try out. The location is really great as well. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a very pleasant stay with Catherine and Patrick. They were kind and very hospitable. They're house is beautiful, clean, and the location was central to everywhere we wanted to visit in Austin. The neighborhood is a walkable town with some neat restaurants. It's also walking distance to the Graffiti Park (definitely check this place out). The couple was informative about the area and how to get around. They gave us the privacy we wanted, but were also available to talk any time we had questions. We were able to come and go as we pleased and felt very comfortable staying there.  We would definitely stay here again if we ever came back to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick were my first experience with Airbnb and I'm afraid they've spoiled me for every future experience. I could not have asked for better hosts, better accommodations or a better neighborhood in Austin to stay. It was absolutely delightful all the way around. Even after a seriously delayed flight in, arriving on a Friday night at 11:30pm, they were gracious, open and welcoming. The rooms and private bath were comfortable and impeccably clean. They shared many recommendations for visiting the area and we're always helpful and friendly. Truly exceptional hosts. "
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine were very accommodating and gracious hosts. They were interesting to speak to and very flexible on my arrival and departure times. The room has a separate entrance and is very private. 
,,,,,,,,"Katherine and Patrick were welcoming and made us feel very comfortable.  They had plenty of recommendations for where to eat, get coffee, etc.  Their lovely home is in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood that is close to a pocket of restaurants/cafes.  It's within walking distance to the flagship Whole Foods, and the downtown area is about a 1.5 mile walk.  We did a mix of walking, renting austin bcycle bikes, and uber to get around town."
,,,,,,,,"This is one place you'll be sorry if you don't choose to stay! Catherine and Patrick were the most wonderful hosts making sure I had everything I needed. Their place is within walking distance to numerous cafes, coffee shops and wonderful restaurants. I didn't have a car, so walkability was a big factor in choosing to stay at their location. You're only a .5-2mi away from some of the major attractions and Uber is super easy and cheap to use for some of the further touristy things. 

Even with having a guest leaving on the day I was arriving, they were accommodating and let me leave my bags/change before the check in time. The room/bathroom was clean and tidy and they have a small coffee maker/mini fridge in the living area for your use. 

Definitely spend some time getting to know Catherine and Patrick as well b/c they have some amazing stories from their travels. 

I know there are a lot of options for rentals in Austin, but when you look back on your trip, Catherine and Patrick will be one of the fond memories you take with you. "
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick are adorable.  My kind of people.  Peaceful, quiet, friendly, and cool.

The house was immaculate and I had my own private entrance and privacy which is important to me.  The sleeps were very good, not a creature stirred in the neighborhood.  

Loved walking to Josephines for Happy Hour.  I will most definitely recommend this bungalow and I will stay again. Thanks Catherine and Patrick!"
,,,,,,,,"Patrick's and Catherine's home is situated in a very nice and quite neighborhood. The house is close to the center it was even walkable. I had a nice room and everything exactly like the description announced: nice, clean and like home.
My flight had a long delay at the day of my arrival and I had to inform my hosts that I'll arrive some hours later in the night and that I can't give exact informations. Patrick and Catherine have been very nice and waited till my arrival. 
I was lucky to spent those hilarious days with Patrick and Catherine. It was a pleasure to meet them. They are perfect hosts and I would highly recommend them."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay with Patrick and Catherine! They were kind and gracious hosts, offering us lots of suggestions and even helping us out with traffic. Their home was beautiful and extremely clean. It was in a great location and the neighborhood was wonderful. We would definitely stay with them again!"
,,,,,,,,"Friendly hosts, good location (20-30 min walk to the city) and plenty of private space"
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay. The house and neighborhood are lovely, and Catherine and Patrick are easy-going, exemplary hosts. They welcomed us warmly and told us about their favorite places in the neighborhood, including several excellent restaurants a couple of blocks from the house. We liked the location, and the room was good value for the money. In short, everything fit the description in the listing."
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were wonderful hosts! Their house is well maintained, clean, and cozy. They had great recommendations for restaurants and activities and were very helpful responding to questions we had throughout our stay. The house was also in a great location- walking distance to many restaurants and shops and just a short drive downtown. We would definitely choose to stay again if we visit Austin again! "
,,,,,,,,They were great. Felt like I was staying with family. Their house is an immaculately maintained old home a neighborhood surrounded by the same. Short cab ride to downtown even during SXSW. convenient stores nearby.
,,,,,,,,"This was our first trip to Austin and we landed in a GREAT spot with Patrick and Catherine's cozy space on Elm Street. Sweet, warm and welcoming (a glass of wine while I did laundry on week #3 of a road trip for business), they've cleverly segmented their home to provide real privacy to the Airbnb traveler. The newly redone bathroom (with skylight!) was a delight. Everything was spotless, comfortable and perfect for this business trip. I really appreciated the access to coffee and water each day, and their guidance on local restaurants and shopping. I'd love to come back just to spend more time exploring Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were incredibly gracious hosts; I arrived rather late on my first day, and both greeted me upon arrival.  They provided great advice on places to go during my stay.  The private bedroom, bathroom and living room were really nice.  I highly recommend staying with Patrick and Catherine!"
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine were great hosts and supplied the right amount of privacy and interaction that made my stay perfect. The bed was comfortable and the place was quiet and had everything I needed. They were knowledgable about the area restaurants which were conveniently with walking distance. Charming neighborhood. 
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick were wonderful. They were very helpful providing us with maps and information about what to do and where to go in Austin. The room was clean, the bed comfortable and house was tidy. Overall, it was a great experience."
,,,,,,,,Catherine and Patrick are welcoming hosts with a wealth of knowledge they will readily share about the area.  Great coffee shop around the corner.  
,,,,,,,,"2 huge gestures by Catherine and Patrick give them an A++ in my book:

1) They accommodated an early check-in for Anna, my gf and 2nd guest. 

2) They helped facilitate a late Valentine's gift of roses and card for Anna. The gift was nicely prepared for her, in our room, when she checked in. Above and beyond expectations!

Patrick and Catherine were great hosts. They exuded a warm, hospitable disposition that would make any Austinite proud. 

Clarksville is a quiet, pretty gem of a neighborhood, not too far from anything and everything. 

Also, the little things: Patrick and Catherine continued to replenish us with a stock of bottled water throughout our stay. They also provided us with recommendations for kayaking, without us ever asking. 

Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick were charming hosts and their 1920s vintage home was immaculate.  We not only had our bedroom and new bath, but the use of a large living room as well.  The location is close to UT and their recommendations of places to visit, including detailed maps, was very helpful.  We enjoyed our time at their home as well as the quiet neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I arrived in Austin past midnight and Patrick and Catherine were kind enough to stay up until our arrival at their beautiful place. Their bungalow is situated right outside DT, which made Lyfting around SUPER easy and convenient. They were the sweetest of hosts and offered great insight on the city and its history. Loved our stay...wish we could've stayed longer!"
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying here, and would hope to stay again when we are in Austin.  The space is beautiful, comfortable, and convenient.  Patrick and Catherine are special hosts, answering our questions, printing out directions for us, creating a wonderful balance between privacy and opportunities for conversation.  The neighborhood has many bungalow homes and trees, and a small set of stores and restaurants a short walk away.    "
,,,,,,,,my experience was wonderful. the space was more than i expected. the neighborhood had everything and was easily within walking distance to anything downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"The house is great.....just the kind I like in terms of style. Proximity to downtown allows for easy access to amazing restaurants as well as the music/entertainment scene Austin is famous for. 
The room is clean, comfortable and has everything one might need. The same is definitely true for the bathroom. 
I would highly recommend Patrick and Catherine's place, and I know I will try to stay again next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick were incredibly welcoming and kind. Immediately got settled in and they provided everything we could have needed. The home was very clean, private and cozy. Couldn't have asked for better hosts. The neighborhood was great and also walking distance from 6th street and restaurants. Catherine and Patrick also had some great recommendations for us. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were stopping through Austin on a cross country road trip and this place was just what we were looking for. The space was very private, clean and had a great home feel. Plenty of room for the two of us. The neighborhood was quiet and a quick walk to anything we needed. Catherine and Patrick greeted us well and were extremely friendly, they made us feel comfortable and welcomed. Would highly suggest making this your stop in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick's home is just as described: comfortable, quiet, and it was the perfect place to call home during our quick weekend trip to Austin. They provided great recommendations upon our arrival and were available throughout our stay to answer any questions or concerns. "
,,,,,,,,"All around excellent. Patrick and Catherine were very welcoming and gave great recommendations for the neighborhood and Austin at large. The space itself was better than expected: large, clean and private."
,,,,,,,,Catherine and Patrick are wonderful hosts. We felt very welcome and comfortable. The space was large and extremely clean. This was not only a great find for comfort but was very secure and convenient.
,,,,,,,,"I had a lovely stay here! The guest apartment was spotless and cozily decorated, and the house itself is in a quiet, suburban neighborhood a bit west of downtown. I took the bus to and from the center of town, though one could walk if one has good shoes. Patrick and Catherine are truly wonderful hosts -- they picked me up from downtown after I'd made my way there from the airport, and were incredibly kind and thoughtful throughout my visit. I would definitely recommend staying with them. "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were excellent hosts and their listing was exactly as described. They were always available to answer any of my questions and address my needs. The neighborhood was quiet, safe, and a very close Uber ride to Downtown Austin. The room and bathroom itself was clean and comfortable. Furthermore, they stocked a private mini refrigerator with water bottles for me- an inexpensive, but incredibly convenient benefit during my stay. 

I would absolutely stay with them again and recommend their listing to others."
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful stay with Patrick and Catherine in Austin! They were extremely friendly and helpful and the room exceeded my expectations. The neighborhood is also lovely, quiet, and within walking distance of pharmacy, coffee shop, restaurants, etc... It was a memorable experience and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick were most welcoming and were available to answer any questions about Austin, their charming neighborhood and the hill country.   We especially enjoyed sipping coffee and reading the newspaper in their very comfortable living/sitting room and on the front porch.   I would highly recommended their place when staying in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is lovely!  Patrick and Catherine are wonderful hosts, very sweet, accommodating, and helpful.  The house is absolutely beautiful and very comfortable.  The neighborhood is beautiful, safe, and close to downtown, but far enough away to be quiet and restful.  All the nightlife on 6th is walk-able, or (at the time of this writing) a $6 Uber to 6th and Congress.  My girlfriend and I had absolutely no complaints here and would return in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were friendly, kind and welcoming people. I had a pleasant stay at their wonderful home. It was exactly as described in the profile. They were great for a chat and offered useful information about Austin and New Orleans.

I highly recommend staying at Elm Street with Patrick and Catherine.

"
,,,,,,,,"I was in town for fun fun fun fest. After realizing there was a booking snafu with my hotel (my fault), my reservation was cancelled. I frantically searched on Air BnB for anything and found Patrick and Catherine's place. It was perfect! The space was private. The neighborhood was close to the grounds and downtown. A nice bike ride if you don't mind hills. For being in close proximity to so much it's rather quiet and super cozy with so many lil cafes and nice spots to eat within walking distance. It proved to be better than my hotel which I've stayed in before. This house/space saved my trip and the hosts made it even better. I would definitely recommend this place to others and would stay here again. Thank you both so much! "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were wonderful hosts. They made me feel welcome and comfortable in their home. They also went out of their way to be helpful. For example, they laid out an umbrella  for me to use when the weather turned rainy. Although my stay was cut short due to a couple of unforseen events (e.g. worsening cold; wife's plane cancelled), I thuroughly enjoyed the time I did spend at their enjoyable AirBnB. "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were great hosts. I was there for a conference in downtown and the location was convenient. They made me feel very welcomed, I would highly recommend them. I experienced a tornado and flash flooding while I was there and they provided ponchos and an umbrella. That was good as I had forgotten all my rain gear! Thanks again"
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine were very welcoming and made us feel at home. We were in town on a very rainy weekend and they provided us ponchos. Very lovely place as well!
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed our stay at the Elm Street residence.  We had the front part of the house to ourselves.  The residence had been recently remodeled and was really lovely.  We had all we needed for a great visit in Austin.  The neighborhood was quaint and there were shops and restaurants within walking distance.  We were also within close proximity to the downtown area.  It was a wonderful weekend.
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were wonderful hosts who were very knowledgeable about the area and gracious with their home. We had access to their large living room, as well as a private bedroom & bathroom. We always had our privacy but they were always just a knock on the door to answer any questions. "
,,,,,,,,"We just spent 4 days in Austin sharing Patrick & Catherineâ€™s lovely home in a quiet neighborhood just west of central Austin. The house was nicely appointed, very clean and super private. The front of the house included a bedroom, bathroom and two sitting areas. We had access to the kitchen and the screen porch as well. While we had a separate entrance and could stay closed off from the rest of the house, we enjoyed time visiting with our hosts who were very gracious. We felt like we were staying with old friends. "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were very welcoming hosts - they were available with any questions and gave me advice on places to go in the neighborhood.  The neighborhood was quiet, peaceful and easy to drive or walk around.

The room was very comfortable and clean with plenty of private space.  A great first AirBNB experience!"
,,,,,,,,We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay here! Catherine and Patrick were very kind and hospitable. The home was cozy and beautiful. The neighborhood was quiet and appeared very safe. It was great waking up and being able to walk down the street to a local shop and enjoy a cup of coffee outdoors with some warm breakfast tacos. Traveling around town from their home was quite easy. We had a blast! We would certainly stay here again if presented with the opportunity! 
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed our stay at Catherine and Patrick's West Austin home. The neighborhood is very quiet and the house is extremely clean and comfortable. I highly recommend staying here. They recommended Counter CafÃ© which is walkable. Their homemade sausage patties and biscuits in sausage gravy is very yummy. There is a neighborhood pool to cool off in. We will have to try it next time we stay with Patrick and Catherine.  
,,,,,,,,"Top shelf hosts! Wonderful accommodations! Safest and quietest neighborhood in Austin, I do believe. The space is exactly as represented on airbnb. Couldn't have had a better stay. Patrick et Catherine sont les meilleurs! - by Sally T."
,,,,,,,,"I had a lovely time at this beautiful home. Catherine and Patrick were incredibly friendly and hospitable. The rooms available, living room, bedroom and bathroom, were beautifully and comfortably set up. The location was perfect for getting into downtown, South Austin and the Campus area. Highly recommend a stay here. "
,,,,,,,,"My stay at Patrick and Catherine's was great! They are centrally located  but in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. I was given total privacy while at the same time not abandoned- they made sure I knew they were available if I had any questions, needed to store something in the fridge, change the thermostat etc. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom was clean and well stocked. I was in and out much of the time because I was there to visit family but I found it very comfortable and private and will return should I be staying in Austin in this area again. Thank you Catherine and Patrick! It was a pleasure."
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were really great hosts and were very careful to not intrude on my privacy. Their house is very beautiful and was nicely set up for guests. Its a nice big livingroom bedroom and bath with your own entrance. The neighborhood is a lovely walkable neighborhood. I think the restaurants are amazing. I tried Jeffreys, Galaxy cafe, Cafe Medici, sweetish bakery, Cippolina and was disappointed. Will definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were wonderful hosts.  The house was beautiful and impeccably maintained.  They were friendly and helpful, but respected my privacy as well.  I would come back to stay again without hesitation."
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely wonderful trip. I wish there were a way to leave extra stars! Catherine and Patrick have put a remarkable amount of thought and attention into their guests' experiences. They are also quite gracious, offering us not only contact solution, but also a ride downtown for our departure. Their hospitality will not be soon forgotten. 

The location is a short, pretty walk to downtown, in a cute neighborhood that's uniquely Austin while being reminiscent of  midtown Memphis and Mobile. We enjoyed breakfasting at the Galaxy Diner just around the corner.

Tl;Dr: Top knotch hosts, wonderful space, perfect trip!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful and friendly hosts!!
,,,,,,,,Patrick and Catherine were absolutely wonderful hosts! Their home was adorable and in a great location with some amazing restaurants close by.  We were able to walk everywhere which was perfect and they provided us with some great suggestions of things to do. We would highly recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were most friendly on our arrival and departure. We had the run of the front of the house with a nice bedroom, bath, and combined sitting/dining room. The house is in a pleasant neighborhood located not far from the center of town"
,,,,,,,,"I loved my stay at Patrick and Catherine's place!  Patrick and Catherine were very welcoming upon my arrival and made sure the ins and outs of their place were explained.  The neighborhood they live in--Clarksville--is leafy, quiet, and, at this time of year, perfumed by something in bloom.  Also--convenient.  And full of great restaurants and coffee places.  The room in particular is very private, the shower a good one to wake up to in the morning, and, while I did not avail myself of these amenities, there is a lovely private living room with coffee maker and front porch to enjoy at the AirBnber's discretion.   I heartily recommend Elm Street Residence!"
,,,,,,,,"Incredibly gracious and thoughtful hosts. Fantastic neighborhood, where you can walk to a great breakfast place and a coffee shop. The bed is a Murphy bed, but it's very comfortable. Everything is impeccably clean and it felt so homey. My only regret is that I didn't have more time to chat with Patrick and Catherine! "
,,,,,,,,"I am so glad I decided to stay with Patrick and Catherine for my first visit to Austin.  Their home is located in a quiet, older part of town with its own little shops and restaurants.  It's a quick, easy drive to downtown or to the interstate.  They apportion the entire front of the home which is beautifully appointed.  The Murphy bed was comfortable for me.  Patrick and Catherine never disrupted me but were warm and helpful when I asked them for assistance with maps and museum information.  "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were very welcoming and accommodating. We arrived mid-afternoon and they were there to greet us. They got us settled in and gave us many suggestions of things to do in the area. When we came back from outings, they truly wanted to share in our experiences. Very open and friendly, but also respectful of our privacy.
Their house is beautiful, well kept and very clean. The space they have available quite spacious and has a bedroom, nice living/sitting room and a wonderful front porch. Their home is a bit of a walk to the main areas on 6th St, but not bad. Neighborhood is nice and quite."
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were fantastic hosts! They met me on arrival, offered great suggestions in the (very walkable) neighborhood and even shared a glass of wine and some great conversation with me after a crazy hail storm. The space was beautiful and I look forward to returning. "
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and Patrick's home is impeccable and a beautifully restored prairie style home. They are also remarkable hosts who are warm and inviting. I had an exceptionally good experience there! The bedroom and bathroom were pristine. I had no worries about cleanliness, safety or security. The most important thing was the kind nature of our hosts. This is a keeper for the long term. I can't wait to stay with them again!"
,,,,,,,,"we had the good fortune to stay at Catherine and Patrick's lovely and comfortable home in early April, where it proved a perfect base for exploration of Austin and surrounds. The neighborhood is charming, eminently walkable, with lots of good choices for dining close at hand. Our hosts were most welcoming, and provided helpful tips when asked; we're only sorry we didn't get to spend a bit more time with them due to our schedule."
,,,,,,,,"This was our first airbnb stay and we loved it. Patrick and Catherine's home is beautiful and is in a very nice area of Austin. The accommodations were great - comfortable bed, private bath and separate entrance, all as advertised. We also were very pleased to be invited to sit with them on their porch saturday evening and enjoy a glass of wine and good conversation.  We highly recommend Patrick and Catherine as hosts. "
,,,,,,,,"This is gem of a spot in a lovely community with fantastic hosts... Patrick and Catherine were so sweet and welcoming, from the moment we walked in they made us feel at home. They were extremely accommodating and were kind enough to take the time to share places to see in the area when we had an off day...
 
The house was very clean, comfy, and peaceful. Which was such a treat being that we spent most of the time running around in the thick of SXSW. 

I definitely would recommend staying with Patrick and Catherine! "
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine are the absolute sweetest.  Their place is warm, cozy and a decent enough distance from the madness of downtown that you can get a great rest without being too far.  They were extremely gracious with their time - even driving me into downtown on several occasions.  They also have several cute restaurants, coffee shops and diners nearby. Overall, would definitely stay with them again and recommend them to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were the sweetest hosts. I couldn't have felt more welcome at their home and happier staying with them. They changed my towels during my 5 day stay and left out water, tea and coffee for me in the mornings. Their home is in a safe and quaint little neighborhood not far from downtown. It was in such a prime location. I had such a great experience, I will definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Patrick and Catherine were fantastic hosts. The place was in a great location with a nice walk to downtown Austin, restaurants and a coffeeshop right around the corner. The place was impeccably clean and comfortable. "
7258204,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Meaghan and AJ were consummate hosts and their home was even better than expected. It's in a perfect location to shop at stores like Olive and grab a bite at Paperboy or delicious BBQ at Micklethwaites. It's also an easy walk downtown if you're there for something like SXSW. The entire experience was seamless, I would definitely stay with them again!"
6491235,4.5,8,9,9,10,9,9,"If you are looking for an affordable and convenient location in the heart of downtown Austin, then Lindsey's place is for you. The space is tight, but very cozy and comfortable. Lindsey provides everything you might need while there and check in/out is incredibly quick. "
,,,,,,,,"First, change the name on the listing, it's confusing to think you're working with someone named lindsey and then get messages from Sean neither of whom I met during my stay.   That was a little disconcerting to not meet any actual people connected with the property - I did meet the lovely cleaning staff.  
The location is amazing in the center of downtown, which was of primary importance to me. The space was clean, and tidy.  Sticky note messages on things seemed a little odd, but it did help to find the light switch.  "
,,,,,,,,"I ended up extending my trip an extra day in Austin last minute and because of the great experience I had the first time staying at Lindsey's, I decided to go back. Awesome place, great location, highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsey is a fantastic host! The place was great... within a block of world-class live music in Austin! the bed was super comfortable and amenities great!
We will definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"The location alone makes this place unbelievable for the value but the people I stayed with and the extra effort by the hosts to make sure I had everything I needed made this a unforgettable and amazing week. I would recommend it to anyone traveling, especially if you're alone and trying to meet people while saving a few bucks. You really are in the heart of downtown Austin and whether you're there for business or a festival or just to check out the city you really can't go wrong by staying here. I can't recommend it highly enough."
,,,,,,,,Cute and accessible to downtown. Worth noting for lone travelers who want to take advantage of their time
,,,,,,,,The space was very easy to check into and was spacious and comfortable. Everything was perfect. Interacting with other guests was a breeze and it was in great proximity to anything downtown and the convention center. 
,,,,,,,,"My stay in the loft was very enjoyable and easy (Lindsey promptly responded to any inquiries and getting my key was a breeze). The location was ideal in downtown Austin, near all of the conference hotels and the main streets, but tucked away so as not to have lots of outside disturbances. The amenities of snacks, breakfast, and ear plugs were a nice touch. FYI the loft bedroom has a low ceiling and does require you to be physically able to climb a ladder to get in. The kitchen and bathroom had nice fixtures and everything was clean. The atmosphere of the loft was really amenable and the guests in the other rooms were all very friendly (we shared a Prosecco toast on my last night). It was a unique experience and I would recommend for someone who is up for an adventure in an eclectic living situation! "
,,,,,,,,"Location - central downtown Austin.  beside a liquor store and many bars.
Key - Host uses 'Keycafe' where you pick up the key from a coffee shop 4-6 blocks away.  So not handy for those who have mobility issues.  Also, keycafe seems to be still going through growing pains so I had to wait about 15-20 minutes while the barista had to call the keycafe people (he was annoyed).
Check-in - there was a mix up about the 'room'.  Kaela was not there to greet me.  However, she was available by text and was able to quickly remedy the mix-up although not sure what would have happened if there wasn't a cancellation.   So I actually didn't not stay in the loft (only reachable be climbing a ladder so people with mobility issues should not stay in the loft) but in a private space with a single bed.
Room - Private-ish.  This place is pretty much a loft that has been converted to a hostel.  One big open space that has been separated by walls and curtains.  No lockable doors or an actual door and sound travels as the walls do not reach the ceiling.  If you need the security of your belongings in a lockable space, I believe there is a lockable space if needed.
Washroom - only one toilet and shower.  Two sinks.  Very minimal considering up to 8-9 people can be staying.
Kitchen - good set up and dishes and cereal.  No milk though.
As I said - this is more like a hostel.  The quiet time at 10pm was not observed by the other tenants and I was not able to get any sleep until they left to drink some more at 1am.
Overall good if you don't mind mingling and bar hopping and such.  Not for those who need sleep."
,,,,,,,,Great loft. I highly recommend staying here. Especially if in town for the convention center. 
14616676,5,10,10,10,10,9,10,Host was responsive and the apartment is located on a great location. Especially great if you need a parking space and want to be close to bars and restaurants. Would recommended clarifying the check in procedures as it was a bit difficult to initially find the key. Overall great stay!
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful apartment right next to all the bars on Rainey street and only a 15 min walk to the bars on 6th street. Beautiful view of the city. Very clean and modern. Would definitely stay here again . Great for a couple. Our 3rd guest slept on the couch which was comfy but doesn't pull out into a bed. Most beautiful bathroom, tub and shower I have ever seen! "
,,,,,,,,"Had a great experience, location is the best, the space was perfect! "
,,,,,,,,Thanks  a lot for the awesome stay. The apartment was clean and super nice. I would always stay again at this place.
,,,,,,,,"Amazing experience.  I felt welcome in the apartment, and got the chance to relax after a long day of travel with a beer they offered in the fridge.  Super convenient to the Austin Conference Center, and all the food and drinks you could want on Rainey.  10/10, would rent again"
,,,,,,,,"I had a fantastic time staying at this apartment! Great location, beautiful style, and comfortable living all around. I would love to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing apartment with great location! You can't ask for a better place to stay in Austin. Got to meet Tara and Juan and they couldn't be nicer. Great hosts, highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was immaculate, and the location is in a really charming district of Austin. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,Great location and beautiful place.  It was nice being able to walk everywhere and the amenities were amazing!
1428582,5,10,10,10,9,10,9,"Kristen, our host, was awesome.  She was always available and made the reservation process very easy.  She has a laundry list of things to do in Austin and even set us up with apps to get groceries and alcohol delivered to the house, and it only took one hour to arrive.  The main house was perfect and had everything you needed.  There is a house out back that had a full kitchen and an additional 2 full bathrooms.  If you can't get the master bedroom, go to the back house and take the room on the first floor, its another private room. "
,,,,,,,,"We felt very welcomed upon arrival to Kristen's home! It was nice and clean. LOVED the very ""Austiny"" feel to the home with the murals and decor. It is an awesome house!!"
,,,,,,,,Kristen and Joe were great hosts. Very prompt communication and responses to any questions my group had. The home itself is a few short minute walk from 6th street. Highly recommend this home for any persons looking for a sizable home within walking distance to many of the downtown Austin bars and restaurants!
,,,,,,,,They did an amazing job accommodating our requests and the house created a great environment for team building while attending a conference.  
,,,,,,,,"The Inn Cahoots team is amazing. This was my first time to Austin, and their suggestions really helped. Their response time was very short and we're open to answering any questions that I may have had."
,,,,,,,,Great place for a large group! We were there ACL weekend with 12 people and everyone was very comfortable. The place was clean and came with everything we needed for the weekend. Would definitely recommend.
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful, huge home in an amazing location. There is a separate guest house that is a part of this rental, omg! Perfect for huge groups. There were only four of us, but next time we'll be back with more! The hosts are super accommodating and make sure you have everything you need in order to have a great stay. Thank you so much!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful stay.  Perfect for large groups
,,,,,,,,Great location and great service by the host. I would recommend this spot for anyone with a large group. 
,,,,,,,,Kristen was great before arriving in making sure we had everything we needed. Clint was nice upon arrival and made sure the house was clean by check in time. 
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's Downtown Single Malt Manor provided the perfect home for a trip with a large group of friends. The house was perfectly located just off of famous Sixth Street, making for a very easy come-and-go process throughout the stay. There was also more than enough stay for all of the guests, and every single one commented on how pleased they were to have a large bed all to themselves. I will gladly say that Kristen's Single Malt Manor should be a model for all large-group AirBnB houses to live up to."
,,,,,,,,"The house was great.  Perfect for my large bachelor party.  Every single person had a bed, which is extremely rare with large parties.  We were able to get into the house early, and it was in great shape.  I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This is an excellent place! They have every amenity  you need, as well as being conveniently located just East of DT. Overall everything was perfect and definitely would book again. "
,,,,,,,,Great place! Accommodated all of our guests. Would stay here again
,,,,,,,,"Amazingly accommodating, quick to respond to all communication, very, very, very helpful with all our travel needs. Huge space perfect for friendly retreats to Austin, a quick walk to downtown and a number of excellent nightlife spaces nearby. We can't wait to stay next year! "
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful and accommodating stay.  The hosts were very nice and the house was primo.  Would definitely stay again and recommend checking out this location.  Perfect for a large group with easy access to all that Austin has to offer.
,,,,,,,,"The place was awesome, exactly as described.  It is absolutely perfect for large groups.  There were 9 beds in the main house alone.  The three tvs were great for watching multiple games and the back yard was a great hangout place.  I would definitely recommend this place.  "
,,,,,,,,"This space was more than what we could have asked for. It was clean, had plenty of sleeping spaces, had a spacious backyard and roof deck to relax, and was conveniently located to walk to all the bars. Everyone was very impressed and would have no hesitation staying here again. Kristen and her team were also great with communication and very accommodating. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect place for a gathering of friends.  We were able to walk to almost everything and the owners were great.  They were very accommodating to our schedule and answered any questions right away.  I would highly recommend this house to any group going to Austin and hope to return back there again.
,,,,,,,,"The location is awesome, just one block away from all the bars.  The house is clean and decorated in a really fun way.  It sleeps 15 quite comfortably.  The hosts do a great job highlighting fun activities in the area and were very helpful in trip preparation.  "
,,,,,,,,Great property run by great people.  So accommodating and friendly with amazing facilities.  You'd be crazy not to book this place!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin. The house is large, well taken care of and perfectly located. Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen and Clint made our trip very easy and enjoyable.  Great communication and very helpful.  The house was perfect for our bachelor party--close walking distance to bars, restaurants, grocery stores.  I would definitely recommend if you're planning a bachelor party in Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"House was great and was perfect for a NYE trip with a bunch of friends.  Great location, walking distance to ALLL the bars, coffee shops, brunchy brunch places, and VeraCruz tacos!  Bunk beds were large, bathrooms very clean, beds super comfy, plenty of room to spread out with a bunch of people.  Just wish it bad been warmer weather so we could have enjoyed the rooftop deck and lawn area more.  "
,,,,,,,,The place was awesome. Clean and group friendly. The host even left some goodies for us in the fridge. Kristen also allowed us to checkout at 3pm which would have never happened at a hotel. Highly recommend this house for large groups that want to take advantage of downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Everything was really great. The house was amazing, and so perfect for our large Bachelor Party group. The Inn at Cahoots staff was also super receptive the entire time to our group's needs, even before we arrived they reached out about helping accommodate us! At first we contemplated staying at a hotel, and this was by far the better option. The amenities were so much better than that of a hotel, and unparalleled for a group of our size. Best Bachelor Party, so much due to the amazing house. "
,,,,,,,,"Couldn't have asked for a better house. Comfortably fit 15 guys for my bachelor party. The hosts made is feel extremely welcome from beginning to end. The location was perfect for what we needed. Walking distance to the bars, $5 uber to UT. And not to mention, the house itself was amazing. Highly recommend it for large parties. "
,,,,,,,,"I just had my bachelorette party in Austin and Kristen and the rest of her team made the experience even better than I could have ever expected! The house is in the most amazing location - walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and bars. The house was stocked with props and beautiful decor which made it great for photos! The beds were SO comfortable, I slept amazing. One of the days there was a huge rainstorm, and Kristen and her crew came over to surprise us all with Franklin BBQ! Unbelievable experience, I will definitely recommend to anyone who is planning a trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The host was very helpful during all the time leading up to the reservation when it came to helping prepare a weekend itinerary or answer any of my questions.  The house itself was very cool and had all the amenities needed to host a large group for a bachelor, bachelorette or birthday party.  The weather wasn't great so we couldn't walk anywhere, but many locations of where you'd want to go is within about a mile away.  Beds were comfortable and there's more than enough bathrooms, showers, kitchen space to accomodate the entire group.  The back house is very convenient for sleeping/quiet area.  I would definitely recommend.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay!  I organized a work offsite meeting there for a few days and it was fantastic.  Accommodations were good and the living room was awesome for meetings during the day and playing poker and other games at night.  Two kitchens made meal prep easy, and the  outdoor seating area was a lot of fun in the evening.  
Hosts were very helpful in planning trip logistics and making recommendations for restaurants and activities in the area.  Highly recommend.    "
,,,,,,,,"Spent Weekend 1 of ACL @ the Single Malt Manor and loved everything it had to offer.  

The property was very spacious & well laid out.  Beers in the fridge upon arrival - always a bonus! 

Main house amenities were excellent.  Proper kitchen, lots of beds, 3 bathrooms and a great main room which came in handy for meals and watching football on Sunday.

The back house with attached deck were great for catching some sun and listening to tunes during there day (also there's a TV - so you can watch your favourite team play while hanging with friends outside). The bunky in the back house acted as a little sanctuary if the main house was a too loud.

All in all would definitely recommend this place for large groups heading to Austin, Tx."
,,,,,,,,"We had the pleasure of staying at the single malt manor for my best friends bachelor party. I really couldn't have picked a better place. We had 13 people at its peak and we had more than enough room to each have our own bed. Our favourites were the cowboy decor, poker table and the outdoor patio area. This got used everynight. And if it had of been a little cooler we would have spent more time on the balcony.  This place was very central to everything. Many food trucks, coffee shops and restaurants within a 5 min walk. 6th street about 8 mins. Great location. To top it all off the owners of the house were great, they went the extra mile to ensure we had a great time from booking restaurants to organising transport for brewery tours etc... All in all this place comes with my highest of recommendations."
,,,,,,,,"We had the best time celebrating my sister-in-law's bachelorette party. We are from SF and have high expectations,  and this place nailed it. The house is comfy, big, and decorated perfectly. Kristen and Clint were sweet and attentive hosts, and gave lots of recommendations.  Austin is such a fun town."
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 47 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience at this house. Kristen and Clint were extremely easy to communicate with and they did a great job of making sure we had everything we needed. When there were one or two issues that came up, they were very quick to respond. I was there with a huge group of guys for a bachelor party and there couldn't have been a better house in a better location. Would definitely go stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Wow, there are no words to describe what an incredible experience our group had renting this fabulous property for a bachelorette party.  The home is beautifully decorated, spacious, and came stocked with everything we needed.  One of the preoprty managers Clint was on-site when we arrived to give us a full tour and run down and even sent someone over on a moments notice when we were having issues programming the air conditioning.  The preoperty is centrally located for easy walks over to tons of bars and restaurants on sixth street. I highly recommend for any big groups looking for a great getaway!!"
,,,,,,,,"Pictures do not do this place justice. It was amazing in every single facet. We easily fit 14 guys over a long weekend and never once felt cramped. The back yard is spacious and has a great setup for hanging out. The neighborhood is extremely accessible. 6th street and Rainey were both easy trips by foot or Uber and there were great food trucks just down the street.

Finally, Kristen was so easy to work with when setting our trip up. Quit to respond and more than willing to assist in any way possible....not too mention they had stocked the fridge with a few surprises for us upon arrival.

Would not hesitant for a second to stay there again or recommend to a friend."
,,,,,,,,Great host and great accommodation.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was fantastic. She was on time, and responsive. She had the house in great shape upon arrival, even loaded with a case of beer! We held a bachelor party for roughly 11 guys, and everything went very smoothly. Throughout the entire rental process, she was always able to answer questions and deliver recommendations on Austin and the house. I would HIGHLY recommend this, and her other properties, if you are going as part of a large group. "
,,,,,,,,"The house is exceptional. We had 16 women in town for a bachelorette, and there were beds for everyone, plus plenty of space to play games, eat, and drink. The rooftop patio and backyard are both really lovely ways to enjoy the beautiful weather. There is a huge grill and beer fridge outside, along with a ping pong table. We found ourselves spending more time at the house than expected because it was so comfortable and beautiful! The really nice thing about haviang two houses is that you can put the rowdy folks in the main house (noise carries from the first floor to the bedrooms) and the late sleepers in the back house, which is basically a big bunkroom, a private bedroom, bathrooms, and a kitchen.

It's on a busy street, but thanks to high fences feels safe, secluded, and quiet. There is only parking for 3 cars, so if you're bringing a lot of vehicles plan to park in the surrounding streets. Easy walking distance to a number of great restaurants and taco trucks, and a very cheap cab ride to the bars on 6th street. 

Kristen was wonderful to let us stay at the house past check-out time on Sunday while the cleaning crew worked since a number of us had late flights. Communication with her was easy as our group number changed a few times and we finalized the costs associated with that. 

If you've got a large group and are in need of a place to stay in Austin, this house is highly recommended. Stylish, TONS of space (indoors and out), close to a lot of great neighborhoods, and our hosts were excellent."
,,,,,,,,"The house is fantastic and a perfect spot to entertain a large group of people. The location is perfect, walkable to the old sixth and a really short drive from Rainey. Also very close to great food truck spots and bbq. Kristen was very helpful and nice. I would use it again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"The house is in a great location, walkable to sixth street and tons of bars and restaurants, and only a 15 min, under $20 uber ride to and from the airport, which was super convenient. We had 15 dudes staying at the house for my bachelor party and there was plenty of room and enough beds/couches for all of us. There were plenty of towels and other essentials for everyone, as well as some goodies left in the kitchen for us. Kristen was really nice and gave great suggestions about things to do in Austin leading up to the trip. I would highly recommend hitting Kristen up if you're heading to Austin with a big group."
,,,,,,,,"We had an incredible experience. Kristen and Jessica were extremely prompt in answering our questions, proactively helped us set-up our check-in time and even followed-up the morning of check out to make sure that everything went well. They were so friendly, professional and have a gorgeous home that's perfect for large groups. 

Location wise, it's hard to beat. You're only a 10 minute walk in pretty much any direction to some of Austin's best bars, live music venues and shopping. The home was so beautiful that we found it hard to leave at times - from the rooftop deck to the bbq to the poker table - every space had something fun to do!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Rented the house for my bachelor party, and it was perfect.  A bunch of guys in our mid-30s, and we had a great time.
The property is very large, plenty of room, can easily fit 10-12 people without feeling cramped.  Every amenity you could possibly need is available.  Great backyard and grill.  Comfortable furniture and multiple televisions.
Location is a short walk (six blocks or so) from the main 6th street bar district.  BBQ food trucks 2 blocks west, CVS 4 blocks north.  Campus is about a 20-25 minute walk.
If you are trying to decide between a couple places in Austin, this place houses and entertains very well, accessible to where you'll want to go, and has a unique style that will leave an impression.  Go with this one."
,,,,,,,,We rented Blazing Saddles for a long weekend to celebrate my brother's 40th B-Day.  Friends and family flew in from both coasts and everyone agreed that the accommodations were first class.  Our host even provided a case of beer and a nice bottle of scotch to help celebrate.  Walking distance to downtown made having 12 people in town a breeze. Two thumbs way up! 
,,,,,,,,"There was a bit of a snafu with the booking so I can't speak to the property, but Kristen & the bunch certainly went above and beyond to make sure our stay in Austin was great.  They even brought us some gifts to make our group feel welcome."
,,,,,,,,"The place is nice and clean when we first walk in. Everything is organized including all the furnitures and kitchen utensils. The host provides complimentary coffee and a 24pack beer for us and I think it is generous and wonderful. And the place is just right near 6th street where many clubs are located. We did not have to drive which means we could just walk (It takes 10 minutes for one trip).  Overall, the experience is great and if I ever go back to Austin to have an stop, I would choose this place again. 

Thanks

1755240,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"From the moment I booked the room, Ryan was very communicative and open about what to expect, how to contact him, and even went above and beyond  to make sure my trip was an enjoyable one. Plenty of small things such as extra linens, backup supplies of paper towels, and neatly organized utensils really showed his experience as a rental manager. There was plenty of space in all the rooms and we never felt crowded. Great stay and great host."
,,,,,,,,Amazing place and in the perfect location. Spacious and having three bathrooms was great. Will definitely stay here next time I'm in Austin with a group.
,,,,,,,,This place was great!  Everyone was so accommodating and it never seemed crowded with a large group in there. Very cool furniture and ambiance. Loved it!
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing time at the airbnb!  The pictures do not give the space justice!  It was a perfect location to explore Austin.  Ryan and his team were very responsive and nice to us.  We would definitely recommend and hope to come back and stay some day!  Also, the parking space was key!"
,,,,,,,,"Very nice place overall, enough sleeping space for the 9 people in our group. Best part is the 2 minute walk to anything that you could want to do downtown. Awesome location."
,,,,,,,,"My family and I loved calling this spot ""home"" for our few days in Austin! It was perfect for our group of 9.   The welcome e-mail had a ton of great detailed information.   The location is amazing as well, walking distance to so many great spots.   Ryan and Thomas were responsive leading up to the dates of our stay and during.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I hope future ones are just as great!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location and space, loved it! Looks just like the pictures. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was a great host, he left perfect instructions and we had zero complaints about our stay and accommodations.  There was a car parked in the space provided for the apartment, but we received a quick response back and was given another space to park in the meantime.  The apartment was very nice and larger than expected from the pictures.  I would recommend Ryan as a host and would stay at another one of his Airbnb's in the future.  Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place in the heart of downtown Austin!! Rented the place for my friend's bachelorette and it was very spacious, clean, and well decorated! The location is perfect to be able to walk around downtown.  Ryan and Thomas were extremely responsive and helpful! "
,,,,,,,,"The listing was very accurate. The accommodations were as described and the information provided for our stay was very helpful. We really enjoyed our stay. It was easy, comfortable, and way better than a hotel!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was perfect for our 10 person girls weekend in Austin! It was clean and spacious, fitting our group comfortably.  It was nice to have 3 full baths to use and TVs in every bedroom.  It was also great to have no keys to deal with, just codes for the gate and door making it really easy for all of us to come and go when we wanted to.  The location of the was perfect with grocery stores, restaurants, and Sixth street nearby.  Starbucks right across the street was a great bonus!

Ryan and Thomas were excellent hosts! Easy to communicate with, provided tons of information about Austin, detailed directions to the apartment, and overall they were very accommodating and flexible.  We got stuck in Austin for two extra days because of a blizzard where we're from and we were able to quickly and easily extend our stay without any problem.

Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,The loft was perfect - great location within walking distance to everything in downtown Austin! Clean and spacious as well. Ryan was awesome - super responsive and quick to help in every way. We had everything we needed from the very first email he sent after booking. You're in good hands here! 
,,,,,,,,This place is great! The location is exactly what you want in downtown Austin. The pictures are exactly what you can expect. The host gives you all the information to check in/out and some extra info about things to do in Austin. This place is amazing for a group or large family.  We had a great time and really enjoyed saying here. It was comfortable and we were all able to relax and have fun together. 
,,,,,,,,"I had an amazing experience. The house was spacious, clean and in a perfect location. "
,,,,,,,,Everything as advertised. Great Place and location couldn't be better. Check in/out were very simple
,,,,,,,,Our experience was absolutely fantastic. Ryan and his associate were always immediately reachable by e-mail and phone whenever we had questions. The house is great and was perfect for our 10 ppl party. Location is also great: only a couple of minutes away on foot from 6th ave. Only (minor) improvement: Wifi connection tends to be really slow when 10 ppl are using it.
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful apartment, very spacious for our group of 8. Ryan was also very helpful in giving us suggestions to food and drinks. "
,,,,,,,,"The process as a whole for this property was incredibly simple. Easy to follow guidelines were emailed, communication was prompt, the building was simple to navigate and the property looked like the photos provided. The property was very clean and in a walkable area in downtown to anything you could possibly need. 

Unfortunately, it was WAY too loud for us. If you are looking for a place to get a good nights sleep, I would not recommend here. It is in an ideal location to walk the city (which we loved) but there is no sound proofing in those walls and expect to hear drunk people, yelling, fights, singing, car blasting and everything else imaginable until after 3 am when everyone stumbles home. And we stayed during the weekdays (Mon-Fri)! We wish when we mentioned we had a child with us that the noise level would have been mentioned, because none of us got good sleep all week. There is only one room that does not have a wall that faces the street.

But if you are looking for a vacation spot where you stay out until 3 am anyways, this place is really great!! Also, the wifi is very spotty so don't anticipate getting any work done quickly or streaming videos. 

If I came back to Austin with friends, I would absolutely rent from Ryan again! But for work, it wasn't the best match. I only write this so that other people who have children with them get a heads up! Everything else was great, thank you for having us.

"
,,,,,,,,The host was great. His communication was excellent and checking in was a breeze. The location was amazing. We couldn't have asked for much more. Would highly recommend if you have a large group of people. 
,,,,,,,,"This is an awesome property right in the heart of downtown Austin. So that mkaes it very easy to get around whether you are walking, taking a bus or taxi. The pictures show everything very well. It was perfect for our group of 8. When we arrived a little early Thomas was there in a couple minutes to let us in. Any time I called him with a question he was so helpful and prompt."
,,,,,,,,We loved our Airbnb stay in unit #313! It was the best!
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and his property manager, Thomas, were incredibly prompt and responsive with any questions that I had prior to this trip. The spaces were perfect for a weekend away with a group of girlfriends. Convenient, clean and stylish!

The location couldn't be better for getting around downtown Austin. Shops, restaurants, bars and workout classes were all within an arm's reach. We loved our time and stay here at Ryan's apartment!"
,,,,,,,,This is a very spacious unit that will make any group of travelers feel right at home. We stayed here with a group and absolutely loved the layout and decor! The location of the unit put us right in the heart of downtown Austin which gave us plenty of time to explore the city. Ryan was a great host and checked on us throughout our stay. Highly recommended place and host. 
,,,,,,,,Ryan was fantastic during our stay! The loft was perfect for a group of girls in Austin celebrating a bachelorette party. It was clean and comfortable and the location couldn't have been better. I would highly recommend staying here for a trip to Austin!
,,,,,,,,Brilliant apartment and very centrally located. I really couldn't recommend it more. Ryan was a brilliant host and helped us with all our needs as well as providing all the information we could ever need for staying in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place for a big group of people near 6th Street. Ryan was very accommodating: we asked to arrive early the day before and, even though it was last-minute, were allowed to check-in early. Everything in the condo was clean and new. Small touches like toiletries, ice and strong AC made this place even better. Would highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"We felt so at home staying at this amazing condo.  It was a great location and the lock system was easy for a large group.  Also, tons of beds and the three bathrooms were helpful with 12 girls!  The location was perfect, we were able to walk to the bars, restaurants, and the river.  The pool on the property is really small though so I would not plan to really hang out there unless you are by yourself. Overall two thumbs up! "
,,,,,,,,Immaculate place just as described. Perfect location. Superb communication. It shows he is an Airbnb Superhost!
,,,,,,,,"All around excellent Airbnb experience!!!  Ryan was a great host.  He always responded quickly and gave great directions and suggestions.  Check-in was a breeze.  We had a party of 10 of us staying at the place and you cannot pick a better location in downtown Austin.  2 blocks from the central part of 6th Street and a less than 15 min walk from Rainey St.  Place was spacious even for 10 ppl.  Beds were comfortable, especially the king in the master bedroom.  Showers were stocked with shampoo/soap.  We are already making plans to book this place again next year!"
,,,,,,,,"I booked the Downtown Austin Luxury loft for my brother's bachelor party, and it was the perfect choice. The loft is just as awesome as it appears in the listing and it is walking distance from all the best bars / restaurants. We had a small group (only 6 people), but the loft could very comfortably sleep up to 12.

Most importantly, Ryan and his team (Thomas, Jared) were incredibly welcoming and flexible in terms of check-in / check-out and bag storage.

I highly recommend the experience!"
,,,,,,,,"The flat was very comfortable and suited us well for the purpose of our stay.
We felt very welcome and the flat was clean and tidy.
Thanks for hosting us Ryan."
,,,,,,,,Great place and location! 
,,,,,,,,"This place was great and was exactly what we needed for our weekend in Austin! The location was perfect, right downtown, and having an electronic door lock was very convenient for the group. We worked with Thomas during our stay and he was really nice, very helpful, and accommodating. He let us keep our bags in an office until our unit was ready, which was really helpful considering some of us flew in hours before the check in time . Overall, we had a great time in Austin and feel very fortunate to have stayed at such a great place! "
,,,,,,,,"The place was great!  Fantastic location, very comfortable, and couldn't have been easier to navigate from.  We had absolutely no problems and everything was as described.  Ryan and the staff were great!"
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host.  He was very communicative in advance of our stay and the instructions on how to access the unit and work everything inside were very detailed.  The location of the unit is fantastic.  We walked most everywhere we went for dinner and entertainment.  We also had a car and the parking spot was a plus.  Despite being right in the center of everything the unit was not noisy.  Everything in the apartment was comfortable and well appointed.  The only negative is that the common area was a little small for hanging out.  We checked out the swimming pool in the complex but didn't use it as it was small and not that inviting a place to hang out.  Unfortunately one of the three bathrooms in the unit was out of service due to a plumbing issue that could not be fixed before we arrived.  Ryan made it up to us by giving us a credit and was very responsive and understanding.
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and his staff were very attentive to any concerns we had.  This is a unique place, as is the entire condo complex.  It is right in the middle of everything, surrounded by hotels, bars and restaurants.  We could not have been happier with the location and the hospitality provided by Ryan and his staff.  Take the bus from the airport and forget about getting a rental car.  You will not need it because Ryan's condo is right in the middle of everything.  We were at this location for four nights and it was great.  "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was a fantastic host!  We just came back from Austin where we were celebrating a friend's bachelorette party.  From the first time I contacted him he could not have been more helpful and responsive.  It made the whole planning process very easy on my end.  The condo itself was very nice, clean and in a great location.  We could pretty much walk to everywhere we had planned to go.  There was also more than enough space for a group of 12 people.  If I ever go back to Austin I will definitely stay either here or another one of Ryan's properties!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience using an airbnb.  Let me say that they know what they are doing!  The place was beautiful.  My girls and I had a wonderful time.  The crew at the Standard was incredibly  accomidating, respectful, and kind.   They were incredibly helpful, and quick to assist with anything I needed.   Check in/out, parking, adventure, anything you needed! Thank you for helping make this trip a wonderful experience for all of us!  The place was perfectly located in the heart of downtown! I have very high standards from now on!"
,,,,,,,,"I booked this place for a cohort of coworkers who were attending a conference down the street. The apartments were well appointed and very comfortably furnished, and the owner was fantastic about allowing for flexible checkin. The one complaint we had was noise from the street, but that was an issue of proximity to popular bars than it was a defect of the apartment. We'd stay again, and I would recommend this spot."
,,,,,,,,"Celebrated my sisters engagement with a total of 9 ladies! Ryan and his business partner Thomas were great hosts. Though both offered their services whenever needed, we were able to navigate the property pretty well. The condo itself was gorgeous! Perfect for 9 but would have easily accommodated 2-3 more! Large space, comfortable beds, and full equipped bathrooms. Only complaint is that water was cold after 1-2 showers and with 9 made it brutal for the remaining. The property is on 4th and conveniently located in very short walking distance to everything! We used Uber and Lyft to get around town for areas outside of 6th street but spent most of our time on 6th and its surroundings. I highly recommend this property for prime location, amenities, and wonderful hosts! "
,,,,,,,,"The hosts were very responsive and accommodating, and allowed us to check in early.  The welcoming email had all of the apartment information that we needed.  It also had a bunch of recommendations and suggestions for things to do around Austin, which was a great touch.  The apartment was spacious and clean, in an amazing location.  There was a bit of an issue with hot water, but nothing that would stop my friends and I from re-booking this apartment."
,,,,,,,,"My stay was perfect. We loved the house and the location could not get any better. It is walking distance to Rainey Street, 6th Street, hiking trails, the capital and has the Capital Metro airport bus stop at its front door. The home was spotless and Ryan was always available to answer any questions we had about the home or the city. Stop searching for another place to stay and book this home. You won't regret it."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience at the Downtown Austin Luxury! Eight girls stayed in this sunny and funky apartment in the heart of Austin. The location was amazing - close to lots of things, and easy to get cars to other parts of the city. The Starbucks across the street was key.  The lack of keys to get into the house (codes only) was helpful with our large group. 

I worked with Jared mostly, who was incredibly warm and welcoming, and accommodating: he met us upon arrival and took our bags (we arrived before check-in), brought them up to the house, allowed a late check out, and helped us find the bus back to the airport. He really made us feel welcome and like he would help us with anything we needed. The house was freshly cleaned upon our arrival and we loved staying there!

"
,,,,,,,,"great location. the home was extremely clean and perfectly setup for our group. 

thank you ryan! "
,,,,,,,,"this was a great spot! we had a girls trip and this was the perfect condo and perfect location to walk everywhere. the beds are all comfy, the unit is extremely clean and all directions/instructions given beforehand were very helpful. the hosts were more than accommodating and would definitely recommend this listing to friends or stay here again when we go back to Austin. thanks so much!"
,,,,,,,,"  A group of 6 stayed here over the New Year holiday and we all really enjoyed our stay. The location is great and the apartment has everything you need. The description is 100% accurate. We had a couple questions for Thomas while we were visiting, and he was super helpful and responded to our inquiries immediately. A plumbing issue was literally resolved within an hour of notifying him (on New Year's Eve!). Thanks Thomas and Jared! This is a great place for a group and it ends up being much more economical than booking individual hotel rooms. "
,,,,,,,,My family and I (7 adults and 1 baby) stayed in this condo for 4 nights over the holidays. The location really can't be beat! You are in walking distance of so many restaurants and bars. There is a PF Changs and Uncle Julio's literally right down the block. There are basically 4 rooms because the loft space upstairs with the 2 beds is a huge space! All the beds were super comfortable and they had plenty of extra towels and linens. The parking space is right at the bottom of the stairs which was very convenient. Communication was excellent! The only downside was very slow wifi. Would definitely stay here again though and recommended this place to anyone thinking of staying in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Ryan provided in-depth details and was very accomodating.  Great location and a great place to stay.  I will definitely recommend this place to anyone.
,,,,,,,,Perfect location. Plenty of room and decently furnished. One problem while we were there with the plumbing but the host was right on top of fixing it immediately. Definitely would use another one of his properties 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was easy to communicate with and gave excellent directions about how to access the condo. It was huge, clean and had everything we needed. The location was great! It is also easy to enter and exit as we just used a code for everything. "
,,,,,,,,A group of 8 of us rented Ryan's place out for a bachelorette party. The location could not have been more perfect. We didn't have to take a cab once the entire weekend and had it not been raining we wouldn't have even used our cars! There was PLENTY of room for all of us to sleep and get ready. The hosts were very responsive and available.
,,,,,,,,"What a fantastic experience!! Just got back from a five week trip across the states and Austin was definitely a highlight. Ryan was incredibly kind, prompt and helpful with all aspects of the apartment and really helped to make sure that our group had a great time. Really wonderful place right in the heart of Austin. Cannot recommend it enough. Thanks so much to Ryan for having us and hope that others get to enjoy their time there as much as our group did!!! Thanks Ryan!!! "
,,,,,,,,GREAT location for our downtown needs.... able to walk EVERYWHERE. The unit was exactly as described/pictured. Clean with all the necessary amenities. 
,,,,,,,,"The standard is the perfect location in Austin, close enough to be able to walk to the all the bars and restaurants without being too close to the noise. The apartment was fantastic, plenty of room for all of us. Ryan provides the necessary toiletries and laundry detergent. Ryan was a great host, always available to answer any questions. One of the reasons we chose the standard was because of the pool, unfortunately the pool does not get sun in October but there were plenty of outdoor spaces in the city to go to relax. I would recommend the standard to anyone going to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Extremely organized and made the group feel very welcome. We will stay at any of Ryan's properties again! Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at the Austin Luxury Standard was stellar and working with both Ryan and Thomas was an absolute delight from the moment we booked all the way through check-out!

The space was spacious yet felt extremely cozy and is perfect for a group.  The condo is set-up much more like a hotel and they provide an ample number of towels, kitchenware, and more for use, which gave us the opportunity to stay in for breakfast when we weren't out for great Austin BBQ.

The condo's location is hard to beat as well! We walked to most attractions throughout the weekend - whether it was to take a bat cruise across the river or to head out for dinner/drinks on 6th street. At the same time, the availability of a parking space meant it was easy to have a car to take on longer trips outside of Downtown Austin as well.

Ryan also provided a plethora of suggestions for local dining, entertainment, and more - which helped to really supplement or even confirm some of our own choices throughout the weekend.

I would definitely recommend this to groups or large families who are looking for comfort, convenience, and a good overall experience. I have no doubt that I would stay here again for future Austin trips if it's available. 

Thanks for a fantastic experience!
"
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host! I stayed in this unit for a Bachelorette Party and it was absolutely perfect. The location is very convenient and the size comfortably fit a group of 12 girls for the weekend. I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Austin 8-12 people. And the pool was a big plus in the Austin summer heat!
,,,,,,,,Ryan and Thomas were great to work with.  They were extremely flexible and accomodating for our large group.  They quickly responded to every question and even helped us bring our bags upstairs.  The apartment itself is beautiful and very well maintained.  We easily fit 11 people.  It is also in the perfect spot in Austin.  We walked across the street to do yoga and get coffee every morning and walked to amazing restaurants and bars every night.  I can't think of a better place to stay in Austin.   
,,,,,,,,"We absolutley LOVED Austin, and loved the condo experience.  Ryan provided us with information regarding airport shuttles, recommendations and even accomodated our group with an early check in.  The process was seamless!  I would recommend Ryan and this property to anyone!  "
,,,,,,,,Great place in a great location! We had 8 guys and all fit nicely with 1 on the couch. The building often has people visiting for the weekend as we saw a couple other groups like us. Ryan and his associate Thomas were both prompt in responses and helpful. Would come back again.
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was great to deal with, came with group of 11 and place was perfect, in a great location for what we were looking for, close to restaurants, bars, downtown etc."
,,,,,,,,"This is an awesome spot for a weekend trip with a group. It is central to a lot of great food, bars and six street. There is plenty of space for a big group to spread out. Next time I head back to Austin, I will certainly stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This place was amazing! I came to Austin for my sister's bachelorette with 11 other girls. We fit perfectly! Also,the location was ideal.  Everywhere we went was within a 10 to 15 minute walk (6th street and Rainey St as well as a ton of amazing restaurants) 
Ryan was wonderful to work with. He responded to questions in such a timely manner and ensured that we were set with everything we need.
I totally recommend this place!!! 

"
,,,,,,,,"Great experience! Ryan was very responsive and incredibly accommodating when I arrived in town a bit earlier than planned. The location can't be beat - you are within walking distance to hundreds of restaurants and bars. Note - this does mean that it's not totally silent at night. If you're a runner or want some nature time, you're 1/2 mile or less from great running by the river/lake. There is a great little balcony that is made fairly private by tall trees; perfect for reading outside, getting a bit of sun, etc. All but two of the bedrooms are very far from each other, so it's an ideal layout for having a bit of privacy/quiet from your travel party."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was a great host! The place was perfect for 8 girls. The house is in great condition and has enough room for everyone to have their own space. Ryan was very flexible with our check in and check out times which was a great help to us and our varying flight times.  It is a perfect location for walking to everything. If there was anything we could not walk to such as the Austin ""Welcome to Austin"" mural or the Barton Spring Pool the bus was only three blocks away and cost $1. "
,,,,,,,,The house was incredibly clean when I arrived! It was awesome! Everyone on my trip was so impressed with the living arrangements. Great spot for an Austin getaway.
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host and incredibly responsive and available at all times. The place is awesome for a large group and extremely centrally located. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was so helpful, accessible, and accommodating.  He helped take care of all the details the day before so that when we arrived, everything was very smooth. The condo was perfect - amazing location, clean, and comfortably slept our group of 10.  Everyone had a blast, and having such a great place to stay really made all the difference in our weekend. We will be back and we will be staying here again! Thank you,  Ryan! "
,,,,,,,,"Me and my friends had a terrific time in Austin and in no small part to Ryan's condo that we rented. It was the perfect distance to the bars, Barton springs and even had a Starbucks across the street which we visited to recover in the morning. The condo was tidy and equipped with everything we needed for the weekend festivities. Additionally Ryan helped me with numerous recommendations and when a problem that we had in Austin came up he was in communication with us to resolve it. I would chose Ryan and his condo if and when I come back to Austin and would recommend it to anyone."
,,,,,,,,Stayed here for a long weekend. Great location and wonderful place! Would happily stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"This condo was perfect for a long weekend in Austin. It was very well maintained with all the necessities provided. The 12 people staying at the condo were comfortable in the accommodations. There was a small issue with the water heater but Ryan was very quick in getting this resolved and taken care of.

This is the perfect location to walk to the bars on E. 6th and cabs were readily available across the street to take us anywhere we needed to go. The condo was a corner unit and had keyless entry that helped a lot for managing a large group of people.

Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was very much in contact with me thruout the booking/RSVPing/checking-in process. 

Most everything about the apartment was as described and as depicted in the photos, although my group felt the kitchen was a bit lacking in amenities. (Dont expect there to be as much as a spice rack nor spray for your cooking pan -- just plan ahead and bring in everything you'll think you'll need! We were also surprised to see a Keurig as opposed to a traditional coffee maker, and no tea kettle, but Starbucks is literally across the street (and Jo's a few blocks away) so we satisfied our fix that way.) Otherwise, beds were comfy, there were plenty of fresh towels to go around, etc.. Plenty of room for the 9 of us to stay without being on top of each other or fighting for the bathrooms. The living/dining area was large enough and had enough seating for us to gather together to eat.

The location can't be beat -- surrounded by food, drinks, and the downtown music scene. We were an industrious group and even made it deep into SoCo and over to the eastside of I-35 by foot.

Would definitely consider staying here again if the occasion arose!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan is the perfect host! He was readily available throughout the whole trip just to ensure everything was going well for us. He responded promptly to all of our questions and immediately addressed any concerns that we had. For example, we thought one of the windows was broken because we could feel air coming through. I texted Ryan and he sent a maintenance guy right over to fix it. It turned out that the window wasn't closed all the way >_ Another example of Ryan's great customer service is when my friends arrived in Austin late Thursday night with a car rental that they decided to get at the last minute. The assigned parking was taken by another vehicle so I texted Ryan very late that night (around 1-2am) and he responded right away to address our problem. He even went above and beyond in helping us find good restaurants to eat for lunch/dinner. We loved his condo - it was fully equipped with almost everything we needed (there are no condiments...salt, pepper, cooking oil, etc). It was walking distance to all of the bars, clubs, restaurants, food trucks and touristy spots! We enjoyed our stay at Ryan's condo and would definitely rent his place again if we come back to Austin. I highly recommend Ryan - his hospitality made our experience in Austin all the better! :)"
,,,,,,,,Ryan was great. When we got there he stuck around and helped us get the lay of the land as none of us had been to Austin. He also helped my friends with a couple of surprises and even hand delivered a package halfway through the weekend. The place was immaculate and it was comfortable for the whole basketball team. 
,,,,,,,,"This was the second of our group's rentals from Ryan--and as promised, he was an excellent host! This location can't be beat and our group greatly enjoyed their stay being right downtown. "
,,,,,,,,Great Place and Location!  Ryan was very responsive to any issues.  If you have 10ish people just make sure to plan your showers so you don't have to take a cold one :)  
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was the perfect host and made sure our every request was meet before, during and after our stay.  He accommodated our request and was easy to reach for any questions we had during our stay. The convenient location across from the convention center was perfect for our corporate hospitality suite. We look forward to working with Ryan for our future events in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location and Ryan was exceptional host! He was quick to respond to inquiries and was helpful when we realized we had booked a place with no elevator - 2 of our 11 group had trouble with stairs for medical reasons but we managed! Was really my fault for not clicking on ALL the tabs in the desciption to find where the elevator is not checked on the amenities list.
Kitchen did not have everything needed - was missing large bowls, toaster, mixer, can opener, measuring cups, baking pans, kichen towels (except paper towels were provided), and potholders to remove anything from oven - made for some interesting challenges! The biggest item missing was coffee cups!
Plenty of beds for the 11 in our group (family ages 2 to 54) but not enough living or dining space for more than 5 or 6 people in one area - living room had one couch and one chair that seated 4 at most - there was one additional couch located in the balcony but not conducive to large group gatherings. The living and dining area are open to each other so we could sit 8-9 people and still see each other - just not so good for having conversations. For a condo that has very restrictive noise criteria, having a large drum with the two drumsticks on it in the middle of the Living Room with a 2 and 4 year old was a huge challenge - not to mention the bells hanging on the mirror above the fireplace.
Great place to stay if you are just sleeping and want to be close to everything! The fire station around the corner was also a busy one in the middle of the night! We stayed 4 nights - ran out of toilet paper on  second day with only 3 full rolls and 3 partial rolls for 11 people in 3 bathrooms. Weather happened to be in the 40's and 50's - the upstairs balcony got all the  heat and the three bedrooms downstairs got very little heat! There was a fireplace but nothing to burn in it. 
The Living Room TV had been wall-mounted where 2 built-in shelves were removed - the wall was never painted out to match. With 11 people, we also ran out of hot water fairly quickly with just showers - there is a oversized jetted tub upstairs that would drain the hot water heater for one person to use! All in all - was a great rental for the price and location - I would stay again and just know more of what to expect! Condo is probably more appropriate for groups just looking for a bed and always out somewhere else for meals and fun. With a few more of the missing details provided, I would definitely give this a 4 star!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's place was exactly what we expected. It wasn't too fancy or nice, but had plenty of room for our group of 12. Ryan was extremely easy to communicate with, and had everything we needed to prepare for a great weekend in Austin. The location was perfect, and getting in and out of the complex/apt couldn't have been any easier. I would highly recommend staying with Ryan if you have a large group and want a great downtown location. "
,,,,,,,,"Unbelievable location and an extremely well kept unit with no clutter.  No kinks, and communicating with Ryan was easy at any point.  Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good location downtown with access to everything.  "
5852265,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great location, just as advertised, and very clean. I recommend for anyone in town for work or to explore."
,,,,,,,,"My stay was smooth and convenient, that is once I figured out which door to enter through (if you arrive in the dark you'll want a flash light, the alley is steep and isn't well lit). I was able to airplay my workout program on the Apple TV, connect to wifi, and they had great magazines about local stuff to do. The bathroom has a bit of an industrial look to it, the shower was warm, and the bed comfortable. Thx Adam! "
,,,,,,,,This place was perfect! It was super close to downtown. I had to make a change to my reservation and he was super accommodating. Would definitely recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Austin! The location cannot be beat, and check in - check out was a breeze. Thanks again Adam."
,,,,,,,,Awesome location! 6th Street is blocks away! Nice secluded place that was neat and modern! Would definitely stay again. 
,,,,,,,,Adam was great- place was great. Easy walk to downtown. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,I'df have to give it 7 stars for accuracy because going by the pictures I thought it was going to be a whole lot smaller. VERY spacious with plenty of amenities. Our stay was both comfortable and convenient and I'd recommend this accommodation for anyone looking to check out Austin.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience. The location was excellent for the price and Adam was very easy to communicate with. The only issue we encountered was that the TV did not work. It wasn't a big problem because we out most of the day, but it would have been nice to have that in the evening."
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay at Adam's place. The location is extremely convenient and we were able to walk to many places such as the original Whole Foods, graffiti park, and even the bars on 6th street. Street parking was also super helpful since there are plenty of spaces and Adam provided a parking permit."
,,,,,,,,"Great location in a classic Austin style.  Walk to Wholefoods, multiple restaurants, downtown Austin and Town Lake.  From the porch you have a great view of the downtown skyline!  The apartment was cozy, clean, quiet and felt very private.  I would definitely stay here again on a future visit."
,,,,,,,,The place was great and very convenient to get to other places.
,,,,,,,,Perfect spot for a great Austin visit
,,,,,,,,The trip was great! The treehouse was in a convenient location for us. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,Adam was great! Especially with communicating with us the whole time! He was very attentive and helpful to anything we needed! I would definitely come back and stay! Great time in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Perfect neighborhood that was close to downtown but also far enough away that it was quiet.  Such a cute apartment and it really did feel like a treehouse...a tree literally goes through the deck and it's so beautiful!  Adam was readily available to answer any issues or questions we had!  Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great.  Very spacious and clean.  It was also the perfect location.  We were able to bike or walk most places.  Especially liked being close to Lady Bird Johnson Lake and the trails around it.  We didn't need Adam much, but when we did he was quick to respond.  "
,,,,,,,,Adam was great. The place was great! The shower was especially amazing during the >100 degree Austin July days!
,,,,,,,,Adam was very welcoming and quickly had answers to all of my questions. His guidebook on the airbnb profile is handy. The apartment was very spacy. There were four adults in our group and we had no problems in our two night stay. The neighbourhood is lovely and exploring the city is easy from there.
,,,,,,,,"Great place, with easy access to a lot of stuff (6th st, Whole Foods, etc). Given the ban on Uber, Lyft, walkability is crucial for me now. Our offices are closeby as well, so didn't have the need to get a taxi, and could pick up some food on the way back.

Also, the place is super spacious. I loved the work desk with a monitor and a lamp. The bathroom is new and funky, the bed is big, and the closet is huge too (not that i needed it)."
,,,,,,,,Awesome location and a cool property.  Super close to the action!  Adam did a great job welcoming us and helping us throughout our stay.
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a fantastic host and his place was in a fantastic location to explore Austin. Also, it was the first place ever that was actually bigger than the pictures! Highly recommend !"
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was perfect! Roomy, clean, comfortable and located 2 blocks from my office. There was coffee on the shelf, a few beers in the fridge and everything I needed to feel at home. Great location, awesome apartment- will definitely want to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Adam's space was excellent! It is designed very nicely and the sofa couch was pretty comfortable. We greatly enjoyed the deck and being close to everywhere we wanted to explore. We liked that there was a keypad to unlock the unit and how responsive Adam was to all of our questions. Definitely would recommend Adam's place to anyone going to Austin!
,,,,,,,,Great location and very attentive host.  
,,,,,,,,"Adam was great about communication before, during and after trip. Responded to my messages right away and was available during our stay with any questions we had. The apartment was in a great location and neighborhood which made it easy to access the city via bus, bike or walking. The place itself was very spacious and clean. We would recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very proactive in his communication - inquiring ahead of time if we expected any difficulties or needed any help.  He was also excellent in replying to a few of our questions. He gets an A+ for communication, which is to me always vitally important

His home is in a great area - cute neighborhood close to the action of downtown.  

Unit is perfect for 2 - very comfortable bed. Okay couch. Ok TV (wish it had real cable TV instead of just netflix). House as very clean (not immaculate) and well provisioned.  Beautifully redone bathroom. Nice back porch

We would definitely stay here again. The unit is great and so is the host

We would "
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at the Austin treehouse. The location couldn't be more perfect -- very nice neighborhood but central to all Austin has to offer -- everything was either a nice walk or a $5-10 lyft ride away. If you haven't been the Whole Foods right around the corner is a destination in itself! The apartment is very well kept and has many basic amenities to make your stay comfortable.  Adam was an excellent host and made himself available for anything we needed. It was our first air bnb experience and couldn't have been any better. Thank you, Adam!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was awesome, really responsive and very welcoming! He even provides bikes so you can tour Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Excellent location. Adam was very helpful when we had questions and internet issues. 
,,,,,,,,Adam was courteous and generous.  He checked in to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  The apartment was beautiful and conveniently located.
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a fantastic host - responsive and easy to communicate with. His apartment was clean and tidy and in a wonderfully quiet, residential neighborhood. We managed to comfortably fit three people in the apartment very comfortably and had a fantastic stay!"
,,,,,,,,Adam's place is a great space in a great location. The house is fresh and clean with great natural light and loads of conveniences. Outside is a beautiful deck and yard that feels a bit like a secret garden. The location is a prime spot. Whole Foods is across the street so you can walk over and pick up some groceries. There are a number of great shops and restaurants within 2-3 blocks of the house. It was maybe a 20 minute walk to downtown and the Capital building. I would definitely stay there again and recommend the place to others. Adam was also a warm and accommodating host. He was prompt about providing the needed info for check in and out and followed up to be sure everything was A-okay.  
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I traveled to Austin for a wedding, and we really enjoyed staying at Adam's downtown treehouse- it is a great location, and Adam was very responsive to our questions and requests.  Nice sized kitchen and bathroom, and a cozy porch. Tour bikes were not in good shape unfortunately, due to some animals finding the tires tasty :-), but Adam was quick to rectify the situation. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam was great. Very responsive when we had questions. Very cute, quaint neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,"What a beautiful place! Inside and Out. I had such a great stay at the treehouse. Loved the neighboorhood. This was my first stay in Austin, staying at this spot was such a cool way to get introduced to such a cool city."
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very attentive, but didn't once get in our way. Check-in was super easy and the unit was easy to find and get to from the airport. The neighborhood was great: so close to Whole Foods and shops and a 10 minute walk or less to other really great neighborhoods as well. It was out of the chaos of downtown, but just a short distance from it if you need to be there. Everything we needed was in the unit and Adam answered very quickly if we had any questions. I would highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam made great suggestions on what to see and where to go in the city. He was super accommodating and the place was awesome! It was so comfortable, we spent a lot of timing just hanging out and getting some good R&R there. 10/10, definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"We were welcomed before we arrived with assuring messages and instructions. A clean, well appointed, and relaxing atmosphere made the apartment easy to enjoy. 
Super downtown view from the deck. 
Planning our return visit already. "
,,,,,,,,"My fiancee and I had a wonderful time in Austin.  Thanks to Adam's wonderful Downtown Austin Treehouse, we definitely enjoyed our stay!  We loved the location and it was nice being able to walk to most places we need to be at.   It's a really cute neighborhood and I felt really safe and welcomed there.  Thanks, Adam!  We really had a wonderful time!  
Best, 
Nicole"
,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed staying here. The house was really clean and comfortable and in a great location. It was easy to walk to a whole foods, restaurants and Zilker park. Adam was a great host- checked in and made sure we settled ok and is quick to respond to questions. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was great! Adam was very considerate and made sure to check in multiple times. The house was very comfortable and beautiful, we enjoyed the porch for a few hours of relaxation. The location was ideal and the accommodations were perfect for a long weekend stay in the heart of Austin. Definitely recommend Adam's place and will be coming back some day! "
,,,,,,,,"I had a great three days exploring Austin TX for the first time. Adam's place was perfect for me. It's in a great neighbourhood right on the edge of the city/downtown and I walked everywhere. WholeFoods, REI and BookPeople right across the road;  Waterloo Records almost next door;  great breakfasts at the Counter Cafe and heaps of other food/bar options in 6th Street.  Adam's place is comfortable and spacious and very clean, and Adam himself very accommodating and helpful. I can imagine it is lovely stirring on the back deck enjoying a beer when it gets warmer. "
,,,,,,,,"I honestly have to say this property was better than I imagined! Adam definitely stepped it up with this new house. It's glorious!! The porch has to be my favorite part with the huge tree going through it. It was truly a magical stay in Austin. From the porch you can see the city, sit peacefully and enjoy your morning coffee. It's a prime location, walking distance to lots of shopping (ANTHROPOLOGIE) , restaurants and downtown. We couldn't have enjoyed it more. The location is sooo central and easy to get anywhere really quickly-- South Congress, 6th Street, East Austin, Clarksville, Zilker Park. The home itself is very comfortable, has lots of natural light, is clean, extremely spacious, minimal and restful. It was right up our alley. The home also had everything we need-- lots of goodies to make coffee and a full kitchen for cooking. They have a grinder too if you want to bring your own beans-- or walk to Whole Foods to buy some local beans! It's the perfect Austin experience. This rental makes us love this city!"
,,,,,,,,"My stay at Adam's was perfect.

The home was clean and cozy. In a great location and he was very helpful through my trip. Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host - super, super helpful and SO accommodating - we arrived earlier than check-in and he allowed us to leave slightly later than standard checkout time. He was available for recommendations throughout the stay. The unit was very clean and provided all standard amenities (eg. towels, hair dryer, etc). Not to mention fantastic location!

Would definitely stay here again and recommend to family and friends."
,,,,,,,,"Although I wasn't able to meet Adam in person, self-check-in was seamless. The apartment was stylish and clean throughout, and quiet throughout our entire stay. The central location made all the difference - we had a car and loved the convenience of a free parking spot but could easily walk anywhere downtown. The memory foam bed was extremely comfortable. Adam was communicative and ensured we had everything we needed. Overall, excellent experience. We want to stay here again the next time we return to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience at Adam's Treehouse!  The location was perfect for us-- an array of dining options in the immediate neighborhood with close proximity to the river for great walking in the gorgeous Austin sunshine.  The apartment was clean and inviting and parking was easy.  Comfortable bed and stocked kitchen.  We would definitely stay again!  
,,,,,,,,"After we had a little trouble getting in touch, Adam was a great host and really took care of my needs throughout my stay.  I called Adam a day before my stay and he assured me that the unit would be ready once I arrived.  After I arrived, he sent me a message to check in and arranged a slightly later check out.  The unit did not disappoint.  It has a great big kitchen, a nice comfy couch with an Apple TV set up, and a great bed.  The location is fantastic.  Literally a two-minute walk to the Whole Foods and well within reach of all there is to see in downtown Austin.  Thanks Adam!"
,,,,,,,,It was the best!!!! 5 star rating
,,,,,,,,"What a great place! The apartment is in a terrific and convenient location. The space is lovely, spacious, and super comfortable! "
,,,,,,,,"Another solid visit to Austin, thanks to Adam! This is probably my fifth time staying at Adam's place. If you're looking for a spacious location in a great part of Austin, look no further. The fact that I keep coming back should be review enough!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was as described and the logistics were very easy for the house.  The place was outstanding and the location was unbeatable. The patio is like a small oasis in the downtown area where you can see the skyscrapers peering out over the trees in the backyard. I'll be back for sure.
,,,,,,,,Adam was a great host! Would be happy to stay with him again.
,,,,,,,,The perfect place for a little Austin getaway! Adam was quick to respond despite our last minute booking and ensured the place was PERFECT even though he was about to leave town. Would definitely recommend to friends and family! 
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host. The setup at his home was very well thought out and made me feel very comfortable. Additionally, Adam was easily accessible whenever I ran into any minor problems. His short response time was a delight.

The apartment itself was cozy and in an awesome location. Z Tejas and several bars are a very short walk away. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"First off, Adam was super responsive to our request and easy to get a hold of.  But well beyond that, this place is just beautiful... full of natural light, charm and comfort! The kitchen is really well appointed and the deck is perfect for evening beers among the trees. The location near Whole Foods, the Town Lake trail and the entire Clarksville neighborhood is incredible. We will definitely be keeping this on the top of our list for Austin home-away-from-homes!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, close to some great facilities and easy to get downtown. For whatever is not within walking distance, you can just grab a taxi/Uber/Lyft as this is cheap in Austin. There are some truck deliveries in the area, so you may want to bring some earplugs if you're a light sleeper."
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a stellar host. Great communicator, gave us a bunch of information and pointers and the house was spotless. Very professional. Couldn't ask for more. Would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,We had a fantastic time staying at Adams ! Its in a great location surrounded by bars and restaurants and only a little walk down to the main part of 6th street. The place was really well maintained and the perfect amount of space  for the two of us and Adam was only too willing to help us out with whatever we needed ! Thanks heaps for having us !!
,,,,,,,,This apartment was in a great location in Austin. The apartment was beautifully decorated and furnished. I would definetly stay again.

,,,,,,,,Great experience. The location couldn't be more perfect - easy walking around Austin.
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay here! The apartment is in a great neighborhood and we loved starting our mornings with breakfast and coffee from Whole Foods. The main reason for our Austin visit was to attend the Austin City Limits music festival and this location was perfect for getting to Zilker Park. 
,,,,,,,,Adam was easy to work with and his place is really sweet.  It is in a wonderful location with easy access to some of the best spots in Austin.  
,,,,,,,,The apartment is so well-located! Everything is an easy walk or a couple dollars for an Uber. We were very comfortable and the place was spotless. If you want to be close to downtown this is the perfect place. 
,,,,,,,,The apartment was spotless and in the perfect location -- pretty central to downtown but in a relatively quiet neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants near by.  Would love to stay here again next time I'm in Austin.  Thanks Adam!
,,,,,,,,"Good stay at Adam's place in Downtown Austin, the location was great. Air conditioning system was very much appreciated considering the heat, and it was wonderful having such a comfortable bed and clean surroundings. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was fantastic and I absolutely loved the apartment. It was very conveniently located, tasteful and comfortable. The balcony is definitely a treat, and we were really happy for the air conditioning in the summer heat!"
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying at Adam's place. 

Of all of my friends that flew into town for a wedding I think this was the best situated - near the action but far enough away to get some sleep. Having the 24 Diner across the road was perfect for late night snacking.

Adam was also helpful getting us a later checkout despite us asking quite late in the piece so we appreciated that. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place is great!! Right across the street from one of my favorite restaurants in Austin, 24 Diner. Love this neighborhood and would recommend Adam's place to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"This nice, clean home is in a great location within walking distance of shopping, outdoor activities at the river, and nightlife.

We didn't get to meet Adam, but he made sure we had plenty of detailed information about arriving and the area."
,,,,,,,,"Accurate description, great neighborhood and we enjoyed our stay! Loved exploring Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Great place and Great Location. We would for sure stay again. Thanks Adam for the easy and comfortable s
,,,,,,,,"Great location, although it could get noisy at night.  Clean, simple space that worked well for my 4 night stay.  Would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place is conveniently located on the corners of 6th Street and N Lamar, right across from whole foods. Most of downtown was easily accessible. I was able to jog to Zilker Park and the Bat Festival without any issues. Uber and Lyft will take you anywhere from here for only a few dollars. I felt like it was a safe area. The are a couple of downsides that didn't really bother me, it's located right behind a few dumpsters from the 24 hour diner, and there's a lot of road noise in this location. For the price though, and what I was using the place for (just to sleep and as an office) it was fine. I don't you'll find a better proximity to downtown for this price. "
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay for a trip in Austin!! We were just there for a couple of nights but the house is very clean and comfortable! We used uber drivers to get everywhere and they had no problem finding us!
,,,,,,,,I was pleasantly surprised with this listing. The view from the patio is exceptional! I lived in Austin during college and I was able to recreate a typical weekend with this location. Adam was lean and efficient with the booking. He includes every detail needed to make this a good stay. He even left fruit for us for free! This was a very pleasant stay.
,,,,,,,,"Great! Adam was flexible and lovely, and the apt was convenient and cute!"
,,,,,,,,"We had the best stay at Adam's place - it is perfectly located, and in such a lively area (but as quiet as can be at night when you're trying to sleep). Thank you for such a fantastic stay- we won't go anywhere else next time we're in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Easy check-in and all around stay. Adam's place is in a great spot, super clean and comfortable. Highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was bright and modern.  The location was superb.  Very comfortable bed. Great value.
,,,,,,,,Adam was a great host and made sure everything was clean and setup.  Will definitely stay here when i am back in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Adam made us feel at ease about staying at this property. It was right in the heart of Austin which is such a wonderful trendy funky area. Great restaurants and cafes to enjoy great food at everywhere. Probably 10 minutes from Downtown and more importantly just across the road from Wholefoods! The apartment was well equipped with comfy bed, clean linen and facilities. It felt homy and trendy. Large enough to entertain if need be yet small enough to relax without annoying fellow traveller...... I would recommend this property without reservation!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was so warm and welcoming! Quick clear communication. And was so thoughtful to our needs. The unit is so conveniently located to downtown area, and was so cleannnnnnnn and cozy. We want to stay here again the next time we visit Austin!! "
,,,,,,,,Adam's place was amazing. Will never stay anywhere else in Austin. His spot across the street from Whole Foods is an easy walk to lots of great spots downtown. It's a $4 uber ride to anywhere in downtown and Capitol area. Then about 3-5 miles from Barton Springs and all the great outdoors stuff Austin has to offer. He left us fresh fruit and wine and was around for anything we needed. He hooked us up with great restaurants and it felt like a VIP experience. By far the most pleasant AirBnB stay we have ever had. And best part: it was very reasonably priced. I'll soon be staying at Adam's other places in San Fran and Hawaii. 
,,,,,,,,"Both Adam and the apartment were excellent.  Adam was very responsive to my messages and check-in/out was seamless.  The apartment is in a perfect location as it is right across from whole foods, and just a short walk from many restaurants, bars and the river running trails.  I highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking to stay in the heart of all that Austin has to offer.  "
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was the perfect location for my trip to Austin. Walking distance to all the great bars on 6th street, yet far enough to enjoy a good night's sleep in this quiet neighborhood. Also, the whole foods nearby was a plus. Adam was a great host, being readily available to answer any questions or concerns. The literature about Austin and its restaurants provided in the apt were a big help in guiding our trip. Thanks for a great stay! "
,,,,,,,,"Adam was an extremely gracious host, he accommodated our request for an earlier check in and had fresh fruit and snacks in the apartment. He also gave us some really great recommendations for music and dining in Austin. The place was exactly as described and in a central location to the river, and walking distance from music venues and bars. I would certainly stay here again on my next visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great Space and amazing location! Adam always responded right away to any questions I had. Highly recommend !
,,,,,,,,"I throughly enjoyed my stay at Adam's place. It is in a quiet area of Austin. It is easy to get downtown and there are good food places close to it.  

The apartment is extra clean and it was very comfortable and cozy during my short stay. 

"
,,,,,,,,Adam's place was great to stay at - very convenient location in Austin a $5 Uber ride to anywhere in the downtown area. Communication before and during the trip was great and the place was clean and within walking distance of a couple great restaurants and grocery stores.
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is in a perfect location and having worry free parking was a huge plus. Adam's home was perfect for our trip to Austin. The porch was such an added bonus, we had breakfast/coffee out there every morning. Loved that the place was walking distance to whole foods and shopping. Would certainly stay again:)"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a gracious host and helped me with any questions that I had, even where to get the best pizza in the area.  The neighborhood (West Austin) is a great place to walk in and look at the homes.  The area has many restaurants and things to do that are walkable.
Adam let me bring my dog and I appreciated that very much.  Great size for a couple that wants to enjoy all that Austin has to offer."
,,,,,,,,"What a great place to stay!! We have stayed several places in Austin and this by far has been one of the best experiences. The location is ideal for those drawn to West 6th and the apt is located next to a 24 hour diner, and Whole Foods. The place was clean and crisp upon arrival and Adam even left us fresh fruit-what a great host. 

"
,,,,,,,,Great stay at Adam's one bedroom place off Lamar. The place was perfect for what I needed. Kitchen is well equipped for all your basic needs. Very nicely setup and clean - exactly as represented. Keycode entry makes coming and going very easy. Adam checked in by email during the stay and was most accommodating. I will return.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great weekend at Adam's loft in Austin. The location was perfect! It was just across the street from the Whole Foods and the really fun bars of West Sixth Street. The apartment itself was charming and a perfect getaway for us. Adam kindly provided us with a restaurant guidebook, drinks, and fruit. We will be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam is a great communicator and the unit is a great location. It is perfect for a couple or single to set up camp for a week. With the central location comes a bit of road and commercial noise, but fine for an early riser. The process was seamless and the unit clean. I hope to stay again on my next trip."
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was great! Check-in was super easy and everything was clean and ready for our arrival. The place is a good size for two people and was nicely decorated. The location is amazing and there is so much to do within walking distance, we didn't have to drive anywhere. We didn't meet Adam, but he was very responsive to any questions we had and was overall a great host!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was friendly and responsive, the rental is a great space, conveniently located, would love to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This was my boyfriend and I's first time visiting Austin and we are so happy we chose to stay at Adam's place. It is in a very good location (Whole Foods across the street was perfect!) and we were able to walk/bike everywhere. This ended up being super helpful since we didn't end up renting a car and we didn't realize how spread out everything is in the city.

Adam's place is just as it looks in pictures - it has everything you need and was very clean when we arrived. Adam was so quick with communication and answered our many emails asking him for recommendations which was super helpful!

Thanks Adam -  we look forward to staying here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great apartment to stay at in an amazing location in downtown Austin!  Adam was very accommodating and welcoming.  The location is perfect! Just far away from the noise but only a 1 mile walk to the bars and restaurants on sixth street.  There are also city bikes you can rent for $8 a day with bike stations all around Austin, we were able to use these to explore the UT campus area and South Congress without having to catch a cab.  This apartment is also across the street from the flagship Whole Foods store, this was really convenient! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, extremely clean, and an ideal alternative from any hotel in Austin.  Very well maintained and walking distance to great bars and restaurants.  Only negative...apartment backs up to dumpsters from these same bars and was awoken several times throughout the night with trash pick up and dumpsters being emptied.  Not as bad with AC and fan functioning, but was still heard nightly."
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very communicative via email/text prior to our arrival. Although we didn't get to personally meet him, he did check on us during our stay, which was nice. The place was accurately described and was in a prime location. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks Adam"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very helpful during check-in, the email messages were concise and complete.  He also checked in to make sure we had everything we needed while staying there.  The apartment is a great little place, and is in a perfect spot for getting around town.  I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location right in the centre of Austin! Beautifully furnished and a quiet area. Great for relaxing and very conveniently placed near 24 Diner, Amy's Ice-Cream, Whole Foods and much more. Thanks for the coffee and the really comfy bed!"
,,,,,,,,"Loved Adam's place and the nieghborhood was very ""walker"" friendly. Downstairs neighbor was also very friendly the few times we crossed paths. Location is conveniently across from whole foods, and few miles from 6th street. There's also a 24 hr diner right outside. The apartment itself was impeccably clean, and complete with toiletries/ espresso.

*Would like to specially note: this was a last minute booking for us, and Adam was very helpful in accommodating us.

Thank you!
"
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place is in a fantastic location. There are multiple restaurants and bars withing walking distance and a whole foods right across the street. Adam was very hospitable and quick to respond to any concerns or needs you have. Fresh bowl of fruits, chocolate, couple of cans of beer in the fridge, and the Nespresso coffee machine were some of the extra items provided by Adam during the stay. I was a big fan of the small patio area upstairs where you could just sit and relax after a long trip. The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable.  This is a fantastic 1br in a great location location and an accommodating host. Will definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam's spot in downtown Austin is a true gem. Tucked into a lovely neighborhood, it's a perfect perch from which to explore the city--or watch it go by from the porch. Adam clearly has a great eye for design and the apartment is full of inviting little details that make staying there really comfortable. I was sorry to have to leave and hope to return--I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Check in was so incredibly easy and the location is perfect. Across the street from Whole Foods and nestled next to bunch of really great restaurants, though if you're on bikes like we were everything is close by (if you haven't planned to rent some or know someone who can lend them to you DO IT!! Total game changer!) anyway...the accommodations were better than we could have ever expected! Fresh fruit, some beers and a locally made ginger perry in the fridge are a delight after a long morning of travel. The place is super spacious, bed so comfy, and the shower has Dr Bronners, shampoo, and conditioner already stocked for you! Communication with the host, Adam was beyond easy. Questions? Concerns? He's at the ready to accommodate you. Look nowhere else, this is the airbnb of your dreams!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place!  Super clean, nice layout, great location, highly interactive host.  I'll definitely use this spot again."
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place is a wonderful little place near many great restaurants and shopping.  Whole Foods is just a couple blocks away.  Super cozy with tasteful decor.  Perfect Austin getaway.  Adam is a great host, very friendly with prompt communication.  Will definitely stay again.  Thanks Adam!"
,,,,,,,,"I had such a wonderful stay at Adam's place -- he responded very quickly to any inquiries I had and even leave some fresh fruit and a few beers in the fridge for me when I got there! The apartment is in such a great part of town: you're right across the street from the best Whole Foods there is, in addition to a number of delicious restaurants that are just a short walk away. A PERFECT spot for 1-2 people who are looking to explore the city and want a quaint, home-y place to come back to. Would absolutely stay here again!"
8814439,4.5,10,9,10,8,8,9,A spacious and comfortable condo with all the amenities advertised.  The  location was great for us as we could walk to most places and had some great food trucks right around the corner.  Very quiet neighborhood too.
,,,,,,,,"My buddies and I had a great experience at this home.  I organized ""The Ultimate Guys Weekend"" which consisted of me and my old friends from college getting together.  We used this house as our base of operations for a long weekend of boating on the lake, eating out, hitting the bars, watching football, and watching the Longhorns beat Notre Dame in one of the greatest games at DKR ever.  The home slept 6 comfortably and there was room in the second bedroom for an air mattress.  There was plenty of room for storage and the kitchen was decked out with everything that we needed.  The huge television was great for watching the games and the big wooden dining table was perfect for sharing a huge spread of Franklin's BBQ.  The property was clean and had a really open feel on the inside.  The bathrooms were beautiful and roomy.  Also, we were able to park two cars in the driveway which was really convenient.  We walked to E. 6th street as well as Rainey St so it was really convenient to the local area nightlife.  I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay their again."
,,,,,,,,"House was very nice, well sized, and clean. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking to enjoy some time in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was just like the photo's showed. It was nice and had a higher end feeling to it with open space, cool stairwell, and awesome master bedroom.."
,,,,,,,,"The house was everything and more my friends and I could have hoped for out of our trip to Austin.  Located in the heart of East Austin, we were just a few blocks walking from Restaurants and bars in the area.  Downtown and Rainey were about a 10-15 minute walk or a 5 minute $5.00 Uber / Lyft Ride away.  The house was clean, spacious and very comfortable for 6 people using the upstairs pull out couch.  The property is run by a management company which you can reach anytime via phone and email, we received responses within 24hrs of reaching out.   "
,,,,,,,,"House was great, clearly a full turnkey vacation rental."
11461480,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Exactly as advertised. Carrie and Drew were kind and hospitable. The location is great for downtown access. 
,,,,,,,,"This room is in a not so quiet flat on a very quiet street. If the sound of people moving around bothers you I wouldn't stay here but as someone who's lived in the city I didn't mind it. The room is a good size and the bed while not the most comfortable is huge. The reason to stay here is it's close to a bcycle station, close enough to walk to downtown without staying there, close to some good restaurants, and the hosts give amazing recommendations! They recommended a Korean restaurant that was the best meal I had during my stay in Austin and a park to bike to that was the perfect juxtaposition to the busy downtown. Shower was hot and a good height, towels and sheets were clean, and they made room for me in the fridge (which I intended to use but didn't). Very accommodating on my later than expected check in time and were great with communication."
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful time staying here, it is as described and very local to downtown and the campus. Such a welcoming host, Caroline made the stay like a home away from home.looking forward to the next trip to Austin.  Thank you."
,,,,,,,,"What an awesome place, awesome location, super sweet and accommodating couple as host. I booked this place based on proximity to UT for the football game, but it ended up the perfect location for all our adventures. Carrie was sweet enough to compile a list of must sees, eats, a does from local friends. We could easily walk to the University, 6th Street, capital, and downtown. The room was huge and so welcoming. It was absolutely perfect for our stay. Thank you Carrie! "
,,,,,,,,"Caroline and her husband were the perfect hosts. They were there for advice on what to see, where to eat, where to drink, and offer anything else. Caroline defiantly went above and beyond our expectations for Airbnb. Their home is very welcoming, chic, minimalistic, and clean (the bed and linen are heaven). It is close enough to the city centre yet far enough away. We would stay here again. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Great hosts! I stayed at their place for 3 nights for a conference in Austin. Convenient access to the UT Austin campus and food places. The space was tidy and comfortable. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,"host was present at my time of arrival, and was very nice.  the room was exactly how it was described and located in a very convenient location."
,,,,,,,,"Very nice people - very lovely surroundings. Thank you.
"
,,,,,,,,"        Our hosts, Carrie and Drew, were simply great! Friendly, warm and welcoming couple who helped us get oriented in Austin, and made great suggestions for places to visit and dine.
         Their home is very conveniently located, at a decent walking distance from all the great entertainment and restaurants in downtown Austin, and of the University of Texas at Austin.
(URL HIDDEN) Will stay with them if we ever get back to Austin!  Very appreciative to both of them for their hospitality! "
,,,,,,,,"Caroline and her husband were absolutely amazing. My flight got in late and they stayed up into the early hours of the morning to make sure I arrived safe and sound. They opened their whole house to me and made me feel so incredibly welcome. They gave me the space I needed to relax and conduct business, but were warm and engaging when I reached out to them. The house itself is minimalistic, open, and chic. I would absolutely stay here again in the future! "
15400050,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Carlos was a great host and we had an awesome time staying at his place. Very clean and the location was perfect for exploring the night life!
,,,,,,,,"Carlos was an amazing host from beginning to end. All the logistics from start to finish were very easy to follow yet organized, clear, and detailed so that worrying about the housing for the trip was at a minimum. This allowed us to actually enjoy ourselves and the city. On top of that, Carlos went out of his way to provide us with recommendations on places to eat and things to do. You will not be disappointed with Carlos as a host as his place offers a luxurious stay in the heart of Austin for anyone who wants to have a good time! Thank you again, Carlos!"
,,,,,,,,"As advertised, really nice spot & super clean! Great host! "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful, well appointed corner unit. Great views of downtown and right in the heart of new hip foodie/bar area. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Carlos was a great host...
,,,,,,,,Lovely modern place with an amazing view of the cityscape. Beautifully decorated. Carlos was very responsive and friendly and even let us in early to get ready for our wedding. Loved our stay here!

13898867,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Brooke's place is in a wonderful location. We stayed there for 5 nights with our adult daughter and son. We had a great visit! We were in search of good food, drink and live entertainment. We sure found it! Brooke left a list of her favorite places and we tried most of them. It was awesome to be able to find what we were looking for often within walking distance. Some amenities were really close, but we even walked to ACL on New Year's. so...yeah, we like to walk.  The bonus for us was to be able to experience living in a quiet,  eclectic residential neighborhood that was not only conveniently located, but also full of interesting homes and green space. We loved that we could walk ""home"" at night and not have to deal with driving everywhere... or cabs.   We didn't miss a TV,  loved the Sonos system, and  the Wifi worked most of the time. Brooke was a very responsive host as we had a few questions while getting settled in. We would definitely stay at Brooke's place  again. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect spot! Had a great time in this quiet neighborhood, still close enough to the action. Would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location on a very quite street but still in walking distance to restaurants, parks, and bars. The house is clean and spacious and has an awesome Sonos sound system. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,A great stay in a lovely part of Austin. Very quiet and comfortable and allows easy access to all of the city.
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay at Brooke's home! She was very accommodating when it came to communication and made sure we were comfortable. The house was adorable and so perfectly situated between downtown and the park. We would absolutely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at Brooke's! Comfortable beds, clean, nice shower, and great location. Definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great time at Brooke's place! The house was clean and comfortable for me and my 2 travel buddies with plenty of room. Although I didn't get to meet Brooke personally she made sure we had everything we needed throughout our stay. 

Her place is close to 6th which has a lot of restuarants and bars :) would recommend! "
15271035,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"I had a great time staying at James and Esther's condo. The apartment is super clean, super cool and super convenient to anything you could ever want. Great hosts, great recommendations. 5 stars hands down."
,,,,,,,,"Killer location!  Great apartment.  Getting the TV to work was a bit of a struggle but who cares you are in Austin.  Liquor store, bars and restaurants are at your fingertips.  Really a great value!!!"
,,,,,,,,"If you're considering a stay in Austin and James & Esther's place is available. Just book it! You'll get hosts that are very communicative, fast to respond and super flexible.  You'll also get a clean, modern condo that is situated between East and West Austin so finding something to keep you occupied will be a breeze. I can even rave about their guidebook because I literally went to just about every place they recommended and wasn't disappointed a single time.

Basically what I'm saying is stop looking at other rentals, stop reading this review and hit the ""book"" button.  You won't regret it."
,,,,,,,,Very welcoming and attentive. Would stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,"James and Esther were very friendly and communicative with us.  We loved the apartment - cool design, nice light and windows, comfortable bed.  They also provided coffee, tea, and snacks for our stay.  Wifi worked great.  The location was the best part - on 6th st, just a block or two away from the bars, restaurants, and shops.  Walkable to downtown, 6th street nightlife, Rainey St, Town Lake/kayaking options, South Congress bridge bats.  South Congress is a bit of a walk, but you could do it.  The location is really top notch.  Plus, while the apartment is on 6th St, it is on a quiet block of 6th street so our sleep was not disturbed at all.  Overall, we really appreciated the location and the hospitality of our hosts.  Thank you, James and Esther for a wonderful stay in your lovely apartment."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed in James and Esther's condo for a week, and I loved the experience.  The condo itself was wonderful, and it was close to grocery stores, restaurants, and just a short walk to downtown.  James and Esther were both very communicative and anticipated my every need - I'd definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Great condo, very clean, and James and Esther were great hosts.  I would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"James and Esther were incredible hosts. They were very easy to work with and gave great recommendations on places to check out and restaurants to eat at in Austin. Their condo is in an awesome location-- short walk to bars/restaurants, a grocery store, quirky Austin murals near E 6th St. It is also just a short drive to the other awesome areas in Austin like 36th St bars, UT campus, the Capital building, S Congress area, Rainey St, etc. The condo was immaculate and had everything we needed. Loved the decor too!"

The apartment is almost literally on UT campus, so very convenient for game day. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. 
No TV, not sure if there was wifi.  "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in a great location but definitely NO FRILLS. Do not expect internet or TV. The listing says fits six people, there is no way unless people are sleeping on the floor and even then I don't know where you would find room. James was very helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great, but the huge construction outside the bedroom really stops you having any quiet. Enjoying the apartment to its full capacity is difficult when there are 24/7 constructions happening... So bring ear muffs"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at James's place. It was very clean, convenient and just as promised. He was super friendly to the friends I stayed with (I wasn't around for check in) and communication was prompt and helpful. Would definitely stay there again! "
,,,,,,,,Had a great experience. Was super late checking in but they still helped me out. 
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed staying at James's place during our long weekend in Austin for ACL. It is no frills but comfortable. Unfortunately there is a huge construction project going on right outside of the bedroom window which was noisy at random hours like all night on a weeknight. Good AC but NO WIFI. The second bed is a thin mattress that goes on the floor in the living room. The location is very good on the corner of UT Austin's campus and relatively close to downtown. Lots of food and shops within walking distance. 
,,,,,,,,Had a very pleasant stay at James private apartment. Very cozy and walking distance to UT Austin.  Check in was very smooth. James is a wonderful host very cooperative and will definitely stay here again whey visiting Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Great host, great location."
15132181,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Daniel's place was perfect! Would recommend it highly! 
,,,,,,,,Daniel's place was clean and simple and really well located. We stayed in Austin a few days with our daughter and we could walk everywhere.
,,,,,,,,Dan was a great host! Thank you for everything!
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was in a great location, right within walking distance of downtown and the Barton Springs area.  Daniel was very flexible and accommodating, even though we were on a flight that arrived past 11:00 at night.  The air conditioning was great, and the bed was comfortable too."
,,,,,,,,Daniel was a fantastic host -- he communicated and offered accommodations that were helpful for a weekend stay with my friends. Easy to work with and friendly!
,,,,,,,,"Dan is the man. I stayed the weekend here with a couple of friends for ACL, and through every step of the process, Dan went above and beyond our expectations of a host. 

He couldn't have been more welcoming, checking in with us several times during the before and during our ride into Austin to ensure a smooth arrival. He personally expended multiple hours to ensure that we would have convenient and secure parking (for two cars, mind you), and he provided us with extra bedding from of charge when we had a last-minute addition to our travel party. 

I don't think there was a single time we texted Dan with a question or concern in which his response time wouldn't have given even the fastest emergency response crews a run for their money. He even met us to check out at the break of dawn when one of our party was unexpectedly called home by an emergency on our last day. In short, Dan was every guest's ideal host: equal parts professional and personal, an overall perfect combination of the two qualities.

The place itself was immaculate, and a great bit larger we surmised from the photos on Airbnb. One of my friends remarked that we couldn't have handpicked a more convenient location, and I'm assured that he couldn't have been more more accurate. Situated no more than a five minute walk from Zilker Park and no more than a baseball throw from Austin's rich, diverse array of cuisine, the apartment was everything the listing's description claimed and more. 

The place's stainless steel appliances, stone countertops and marvelous pool amounted to a chic physical appearance that rivaled the seemingly peerless asset of its location. Frankly, if the place were priced any lower, we'd practically be stealing it. 

Rest assured, our next stay in Austin will be at this exceptional apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Host was great, made it very easy to check in and out, was always available if we had any issues or concerns. Place is in an absolutely fantastic location, exactly what we needed for ACL. Great experience, would stay here again"
11398275,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Karenin was easy to reach and very helpful and clear with instructions.  She left some snacks for us when we arrived, and the house was thoughtfully stocked with extra toiletries in case you forgot anything. The house was clean, bright, and comfortable, and is only a short walk from the convention center, Rainey Street, and other Austin hot spots. The walk itself currently goes through construction areas, but the eastward expansion should only make the location more convenient and desirable in the future. I'd definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Wonderful! We had a group of friends in town for a wedding in the Rainey Street area and this place was in the perfect location. The B&B was clean and cute. We loved our stay here! Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"The house had everything we needed, very clean, very organized.  Walking distance to Rainey.  Host was very attentive, strongly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"The bungalow was perfect for our girls weekend in Austin. There were six of us and there was plenty of room for all of us. As other guests said, everything was a short 5-10 minute Ride Austin (or as we learned, Fuber - for fake Uber) ride away. Snacks and water were at the house waiting for us and were much needed after 6 hours of travel. she also had plenty of other amenities available - like toilet paper and tooth brushes so you could literally start your vacation the second you walked into the door.  This was a perfect home base and highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"Exactly as pictured. Beds were VERY comfortable. Very clean. Great patio space, with privacy from the street. 

A perfectly situated spot in East Austin. Easy access to 35, so close to great local spots (Cenote and Las Trancas were delicious)

A short walk into downtown. Even with uber and lyft not operating Ride Austin app made getting further out super easy. Rainey St is a great spot for drinks and just a few blocks away. If you're looking for a workout if in town for more than a couple days, RÅ Fitness on trinity street was awesome and again super close. 

I would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"We went for ACL and it was a 5-10 minute Get Me ride to everything.  Beautiful home, comfortable beds and pillows, 2 car parking spaces.  There's a great taco truck for breakfast 400 ft away :) .  She left us coffee, snacks and old school games.  Would absolutely stay again next time we go for a weekend.  Thank you for your hospitality. "
,,,,,,,,"Karenin was the ultimate professional host. Contact was easy, helpful, and always expedient. The bungalow was exactly as described and I would have no reservations recommending the place to a friend."
,,,,,,,,The place is absolutely fantastic! Karenin is an excellent host! She was so willing to give us pointers on the best resturants and bars around the city! 5 stars all the way!!
,,,,,,,,Fantastic location. I walked into downtown everyday. Karenin even left us loads of snacks!
,,,,,,,,"The place was perfect and Karenin was an excellent hostess! If you are needing to stay close to downtown Austin for any reason, I highly recommend you pick the bungalow as your place to stay..."
,,,,,,,,"Karenin was an incredible host.  Always available yet never interfered with our stay.  Her hospitality is something we will never forget.  Our stay in Austin was amazing.  The location of the house is right near one of the most amazing cafes I have ever been to (and I live in NYC).  It was called Cenote.  Downtown was within walking distance. When we were tired we would use Lyft to get around.  All in all, a great time in Austin, in a great house, with a great host :)"
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing home. Perfectly located, easy walk to all the places in town.
Very very well equipped and spotlessly clean...
Thank you 

if you are having doubts, just book this."
,,,,,,,,"When we arrived, Karenin was just leaving the house so we were able to visit with her briefly and she should us around the house.  She's absolutely lovely and we really enjoyed her place.  I had my in-laws visiting from the UK and the location was perfect for us to walk around the downtown area.   We were able to walk just a couple of blocks to Rainey St. and to food trucks down the street.  Beds were very comfortable, the house was spotless, and Karenin left us some goodies in the fridge.  It was perfect.  "
345221,4.5,10,9,9,10,9,8,"Cecily's place was in a great location and very convenient to 6th Street and the Convention Center and other SXSW locations. Bonus points for being near Whole Food as well.
Plenty of space with the two bedrooms and was pretty comfortable.
The only problem was that it was difficult to get Wifi in the house, although when we went out to the patio/porch as was suggested it worked much better.
"
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed staying at Cecily's house in Downtown Austin. Close, very close to the fantastic SXSW festival. We really felt at home and had a nice stay. The house was really relaxing and tidy and Cecily was so kind to leave us breakfast. We found a Whole Foods close-by so everything was perfect. Thanks Cecily"
,,,,,,,,"Great place and wonderful downtown location in Austin!
Would highly recommend!"
1683591,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Heather was great right from the start! There was a problem with a leak prior to our arrival and Heather diligently attended to the matter and updated us regarding the process of repair. Everything went well thanks to her hospitality and general awesomeness! 
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment with pretty much EVERYTHING you need. Plenty of towels, blankets, pillows, etc. It is a great location on South Congress close to restaurants, shops, coffee, etc. Getting picked up in a cab or ride is pretty easy from there as well if you want to go up north or anywhere else. 

Heather was VERY easy to get in touch with. She was very communicative and wanted to make sure that we enjoyed our stay. 

We had eight people stay in her place and it was comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Heather's place is great for a big group that wants to get everything out of a weekend in Austin that they can.  While only two bedrooms, Heather supplies all that you need to have a large group around 14-16 and still feel very comfortable and at home.  It was so easy to explore South Congress and downtown Austin.  Check in and check out was so easy, and we always felt safe and welcome in the apartment complex.  Would highly recommend to anyone who wants to visit Austin with any size group and any goal for the weekend, be it to site see, party, or just relax."
,,,,,,,,"Great, the location is very good, and the host is kind and give us a very good info about the house and its facility.
Highly recommend for the group of 10-12 people."
,,,,,,,,Heather was a fantastic host.  She worked with our last minute booking for her home and was a great host!
,,,,,,,,The location was perfect. Right in the middle of Austin. There were soo many things to do. The apt was extremely nice and had everything that we needed for our stay. We had 14 people in the apt and everyone slept comfortably. We couldn't have asked for a better host and place to stay! I highly recommend it! 
,,,,,,,,Heather is incredibly kind and helpful.  She went above and beyond even before we booked her home for the weekend.  Can't thank her enough for her welcoming messages and responsiveness.  You will not be disappointed :) Thanks Heather!
,,,,,,,,"My first AirBNB experience was here at Heather's SOCO apartment. I would highly recommend, it was everything Heather described plus some! Heather was also an amazing host could not of asked for anything more."
,,,,,,,,"Heather was an extremely helpful and responsive host, couldn't have had better experience "
,,,,,,,,We had a great time. Heather was very responsive and helped us throughout the entire trip. I would highly recommend staying here when in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"It was more than we expected.   best location in Austin, and better than any hotel we could have chosen, at a lower price.  We would stay here every time."
,,,,,,,,"Eleven friends and I had a great stay at Heather's!  Great communication and she's very helpful. Would definitely do it again. Thanks, Heather! "
,,,,,,,,"Heather was the BEST host and we could not have asked for anything more. Apartment was even cuter than the pictures and location was perfect for our bachelorette party! She was super communicative and responsive-- checkin was a breeze, and she very sweetly bought a gift for our guest of honor! She was even kind enough to send pictures of a few things we left by accident and offered to mail them to us. Couldn't be more pleased with this experience "
,,,,,,,,The place was fantastic. It was located near several really cool places and just a short walk away to the heart of 6th Street. The place had everything we would want and Heather is an awesome host. I would definitely stay here again if I were to return to Austin (which I definitely plan on doing)
,,,,,,,,"Right in the middle of the fun is the most apt description possible. Walking distance everywhere, Doc's Motorworks right on the corner, easy access for Fasten (URL HIDDEN) was all right there. An ideal location if you're heading to Austin. 

Heather is an amazing host! Fantastic communicator, and bent over backwards to make sure we were comfortable and set up for the weekend. She helped make this a truly memorable experience for our group. Cheers to Heather!!"
,,,,,,,,"W(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) Best Staycation Ever!!!! I cannot think of anything to say that has not been said before in the reviews I read for this place. It was beautiful, roomy comfy, convenient to anything we wanted. There are soooo many places within walking distance, that we enjoyed. Heather was available and helpful every step of the way, could not have asked for better service. This was also our very first Airbnb stay so the bar has definitely been set pretty dang high!  =)   I would definitely stay here again!! I just hope she was as satisfied with our occupancy as we were staying there. We did our best to leave the apt. as tidy as we could."
,,,,,,,,Everything was well detailed! And super accurate!
,,,,,,,,Heather and her place in SoCo was AMAZING! she was so helpful and answered all of our questions! She had suggestions on places to eat and things to do that made our trip planning a bit easier! I would recommend anyone to stay with Heather!!!
,,,,,,,,This was a great location for our employee retreat and Heather was an awesome host.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at the SOCO apartment was great! The apartment was walking distance to so many popular restaurants and shops. Heather was very accommodating. She let us check in as needed and encouraged us to make ourselves at home. I texted her for recommendations on places to eat and she responded right away with several good options within walking distance. She also gave very detailed instructions on how to get to the apartment, what we needed to do before check out, and lists of things to do in the area. 

Thanks so much for your hospitality Heather! "
,,,,,,,,"Heather was very welcoming with a very high reactivity to my messages. We didn get to meet her but she was very nice and the appartement was ideally located, clean, with everything you need inside, a nice pool area and fitness center!"
,,,,,,,,"AirBNB will never be the same. I'm absolutely ruined by how amazing of a host Heather was. 

Heather's communication was incredible from the get-go and her hospitality was some of the most gracious I've ever experienced. When we realized we needed a 2nd space, she went around her complex asking neighbors if they had the availability. She stocked the fridge for us and left recommendations for nightlife and food. 

If I ever have half as good of an AirBNB experience I will be grateful!"
,,,,,,,,Apartment is in a great location and is exactly like the photos and description. Host was communicative and available for any of our questions. Wifi was strong. 
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a great host. She was easy to reach and answered the few questions we had. The house was amazing too! Great location, great TV, great great great! Thanks for the weekend Heather.

Mark"
,,,,,,,,"Heather and her apartment far exceeded my expectations for my bachelor trip weekend. She was always available and always checking in with me and my group to ensure that we were happy with how things were going (she even welcomed us to her home and city with a case of beer!). 

The location of the apartment could not have been more pleasing, too. The apartment is right in the center of all of the action--food trucks, cool bars, great shops, etc. "
,,,,,,,,"This was the best place we could have asked for! Location was perfect. We walked everywhere, including downtown, zilker park and Barton springs, and all around south Congress. All with a toddler in tow! The apartment was beautiful. The bed was comfy, the kitchen had everything that we needed, and the little back garden area was perfect for sun bathing while the toddler napped! The pool and gym were great too! The best part about or stay though was how sweet Heather and her family were! They were there for check in, explained everything to us, had goodies for us AND our son, and even let us hire her daughter for an evening so we could have a date night alone! We will definitely be coming back! "
,,,,,,,,Everything was great! Hosts were super accommodating!
,,,,,,,,Our group of 9 had a great experience here. No complaints. Would recommend to any one visiting Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"My daughter and I came to Austin for a celebratory long weekend. Heather made us feel incredibly welcome. She was ridiculously attentive and available, got back to us almost instantaneously when we had a question about anything. She's a dream host. The apartment is well represented in the pictures. It's homey and comfortable. Best possible location, near many restaurants, juice and coffee, shopping etc. Gym and pool were nice amenities too. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,The apartment was incredibly clean and perfect size for our group just blocks away from downtown Austin. Heather set us up with everything we needed and made it easy to go out and about without having to worry about anything. If we ever came back I think anyone in our group would love to stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"There is absolutely no question as to where to stay with a group in Austin. Me and my friends were here for a bachelor party and the entire group left completely satisfied with our stay. This is top to bottom the place to be. With the perfect blend of great location, amazing apartment, and a host that was more than willing to bend over backwards for anything anyone needs, this is a 5 star listing. If you have a group and are going to Austin, this is the only place you need to consider. "
,,,,,,,,Heather's apartment worked perfectly for our trip to Austin. It was great to be right in the middle of everything. She made the whole stay very easy. Recommended!
,,,,,,,,"We booked Heather's apartment for a 11 woman bachelorette party. Heather has been one of the best host yet. She sent me all the details a week before our arrival. In the details there was EVEYRTHING we needed to know. She even bought us a handle of vodka to celebrate! Communication was great, she was only a text away the entire weekend and I only needed to text her once. There was plenty of room for us all with some sleeping on the couch while others blew up air mattresses. The location was ideal for us. But mostly I enjoyed how open and caring Heather was towards us. She made us feel like we were at one of our homes. I wish we could have met in person. I have a feeling we would be great friends. "
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent stay in Heatherâ€™s apartment.  Heather is the most caring, attentive host there is.  The apartment is lovely; comfortable, spacious and all the modern conveniences you could require. It is in a great location, very handy for seeing Austin. Only a few minuteâ€™s walk to great boutiques, cool bars and terrific restaurants. It is only a 15 minute walk to downtown and less to the famous Austin bat bridge.  Heather is a great host, I cannot recommend her highly enough. If I am back in Austin again, I will be staying in Heatherâ€™s."
,,,,,,,,"Heather's place was awesome! It's super close to South Congress and a bunch of food truck spots.  The queen size bunk bed is probably the most amazing bed setup I've seen.  Everything was neat and having an outdoor space was awesome.  I highly recommend her-though we didn't correspond a lot, every time we spoke she was kind, generous, and eager to accommodate."
,,,,,,,,"Heather was very welcoming - reached out with info before we arrived and made sure we had a great time.  Very much appreciated the available food, saved us a bunch of time/energy trying to find snacks/breakfast food.  Very flexible on check in/out times as well.  We had a great time and can't thank Heather enough."
,,,,,,,,This could not have been a better experience. The apartment is in the perfect location of Austin and is the perfect size for the group that we hosted. It's clean and comfortable and Heather does everything she can to ensure that you are set-up for your trip. She truly embodies the meaning of Southern Hospitality! 
,,,,,,,,Heather was beyond what I expected. I needed an additional parking pass during SXSW and she went out of her way to do it. The apartment was more than enough space and everyone had an awesome time. No complaints here ! The location was right by Hopdoddy which is one of my favorite spots. So many things to do and most so near. Would stay here again if need be ! Thank you Heather ! 
,,,,,,,,"Heather rocks.  Simple as that.  She is an amazing host.  This was our second time staying at Heathers for SXSW and once again it was amazing.  She thinks of every detail and delivers.  Her communication before, during and after the trip makes you feel like a VIP and the space is amazing.  Itâ€™s clean, spacious and the dÃ©cor is has a very cool vibe.  The location for SXSW is a breeze.  Easy to and from. I walked to the convention center and back every day with no problem.  Actually quite enjoyed it.  When I say I never want to stay anywhere else in Austin, I mean it.  There is no need to waste my time and look anywhere else, because like I said, Heather rocks."
,,,,,,,,"All I can say is Wow! Loved our stay at Heather's! We were in town for a bachelor party (about 10 guys), and the house was perfect. We definitely felt we had enough space in the house, and Heather was an incredible host. We had everything we needed, from beds, air mattresses, and pillows, to even extra provided food and drinks. The location was perfect as well. Easy to get to, easy to get in and out. Lots of great food nearby (Torchy's Tacos). And less than a mile walk to downtown, as well as an easy walk to Rainey St. as well. Couldn't say enough good things about our experience. "
,,,,,,,,Heather has an absolutely wonderful host. She has a beautiful condo located in the heart of one of the coolest neighborhood's in Austin. We totally loved it and had a great weekend. Can't recommend this place enough! 
,,,,,,,,Great time in Austin! Heather was very accommodating. Highly recommend her as you Austin host! 
,,,,,,,,Heather did a great job communicating with us and hosting us! We had a large group and she made it work! 
,,,,,,,,The place was great and we had a great time. Heather was readily available and helpful! The location was great! It worked out great for our party of 11.
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a great host before and during our stay.  She was very responsive, thoughtful and went above and beyond when it came to making sure we were accommodated and felt comfortable in her home.  The home was in a great location and offered myself and the 8 girls in our party enough room to get ready, cook and hang out together.  

I overall was very happy with the experience; the only setback was when it came time to figure out sleeping arrangements.  The apartment has 3 beds that each fit two people which left the remaining 3 girls to air mattresses which ended up being a little difficult to assemble and took up a lot of the free communal space we had."
,,,,,,,,This place is great! Perfect location and amenities.  Heather was very accommodating!
,,,,,,,,"Heather made us feel very welcome. She went above and beyond, and I can't imagine other airBNB hosts give that type of exceptional treatment. She personally came by to give us a wine gift, left us breakfast food and told us we should feel free to use anything in the house. "
,,,,,,,,"Great experience in Austin. Heather is a great host! The apartment was neat and was perfect for our weekend stay. Anything we had a question about, she was able to answer in a mannerly time. If we requested for anything she was able to follow through right away! Very kind, polite, willing to do whatever the guest needs. "
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a very welcoming host! Right from the moment we made the reservation she responded via email with a very hospitable and warm welcome. This was my first airbnb experience and i couldn't have been more pleased.
The place was as described and as pictured. We had 14 guys out for a bachelor party and we were tight but it was fine with the bunk beds and couch space/air mattresses/cot. The apartment complex couldn't have been more perfect. Everyone in the place seemed to be in the 21-32 year age range and were all very nice. The pool was very active with full bbq area and one of the residents playing music.
Unfortunately, the Jeep was stolen the week before our trip so we did not get to use it but Heather was quick to resolve the situation and bought us some essentials we needed upon arrival and gave us cash for Uber's while we were there.
Overall, we had such a great time. The location is perfect, right in between downtown/6th st/Rainey and all that the SoCo area has to offer (restaurants, food trucks and cool shops). I recommend it for anyone looking to be a quick Uber ride away from everything that Austin has to offer."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing time in Austin!! Went with a group of 10 for a bachelorette and had a lovely time. The location is fantastic - between SoCo shopping district and the river - excellent home base to explore the city! Heather was very hospitable and even offered another bathroom she had in another apt should we need more shower space. She also left a great gift for us when we arrived! The place was clean, homey and comfortable - just as described in the listing. I would recommend this place to anyone with a large group as it really fosters a warm communal atmosphere. There is also a beautiful pool/gym/BBQ area to enjoy. Thanks so much Heather!!"
,,,,,,,,"Heather was GREAT! Super hospitable, left us things to eat and drink in the fridge, and even had her partner pick up one of my friends from the airport! She went above and beyond to make our weekend enjoyable. I am so glad we booked here!! "
,,,,,,,,"Heather was an amazing host! The apt was perfect for our Bachelorette Party needs, and she was available for suggestions with an almost immediate response time. I would go back here again in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,Heather made our experience in Austin a fantastic one.  The description did not mislead us in any way and the place and location were both perfect.  She was super attentive to our needs and was available for calls in case we had any questions or concerned.  Really a perfect experience - thank you Heather!
,,,,,,,,"Everything was fantastic during this stay!! I came in for my brother's bachelor party and 10 of us were staying at this awesome pad, and we loved it. Everything was clean, and as good as it sounded! Heather and Susan were both supremely hospitable and helped coordinate trips from the airport and even pick up grocery food!! They gave us tips about enjoying Austin and I always felt like they were in a good mood and extremely warm and welcoming. Everyone was floored by how incredibly lucky we were to stay here!!"
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed staying here, the location was perfect, easy access to S. Congress and a short Uber to 6th St., couldn't have been any better. Heather did an awesome job coordinating with us, so all in all, a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"What an awesome experience! 

The place was perfect, clean and spacious with a great location in a wonderful area. Easy to walk everywhere. The pool is nice but the backyard is what made the visit so great! It was just so cool to have a bbq and sit down and relax in the backyard!

There are lots of great reviews about Heather already and I agree with them 100%. She is super friendly and everything worked very well and what more could one ask for. 

The definite AirBnB experience for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"Heather was very friendly and accommodating. She knew we were coming for a bachelor party and even got us a bottle of local scotch. Her place was comfortable and clean. It was great for what we wanted. The location was very convenient and the description was accurate. We misread the description thinking there were 7 real beds, but that was our fault - not hers. Heather was also accommodating with the checkout time. Great place and we definitely recommend it! Thanks Heather! "
,,,,,,,,Heather was extremely organized and efficient.  Everything was comfortable and well done.  Great host. You cannot beat the location on South Congress because ALL is walkable from there.  Would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a great host.  Her place is clean and loaded with great amenities (TV's/washer/dryer/coffee maker) and it's in a good location.  She lists things to do, places of interest to see and great places to eat in the area.  She was also very easy to communicate with and worked with us on our check in/out times.  We had a great experience and highly recommend this place and this host."
,,,,,,,,"Heather is a fantastic host and the apartment was wonderful, clean , and had plenty of room for our semi-big group of people. Really a fantastic experience and really recommend this place. South congress neighborhood Is great as well! Didn't take up the offer of the jeep but maybe next time!"
,,,,,,,,"As a nine time attendee of SXSW Interactive, I know that finding housing and/or hotel rooms is a nightmare. Finding a place close to the conferences while being affordable is almost impossible â€“ UNTIL, we came across the perfect condo rental on Airbnb. This rental was only a short walk to everywhere we needed to be.   It also combined the feeling of home with amenities that a hotel could never offer.
The property is very spacious. There was plenty of room to sleep the 5 of us with more room to spare!  The condo had character with its airbnb wall decorated with pictures and souvenirs from previous renters. It was equipped with all the necessities (towels, sheets, even shampoo â€“ if you forgot it!) The back door led out to a nice patio with seating and a back yard. It was the perfect place to enjoy the Austin sun with a beer in hand! 
What brings me the most pleasure to talk about is our amazing host! Heather is so nice and our entire group could tell she really enjoyed having us. She welcomed us with beers and offered for us to use any supplies we needed while we were there. She even gave us access to her car if we wanted to go further outside the city. 
I give this rental an A+ and we hope to get it again for SXSW next year! This experience shaped our trip in the best ways possible. It is definitely worth it!
"
,,,,,,,,"The location is perfect, Heather's description of the apartment was perfect, and Heather's hospitality was perfect! Five stars. Never used AirBnb before but I had the best experience. Thanks Heather!! "
,,,,,,,,The host was made sure the apartment was expected it to be. The apartment itself is absolutely beautiful and easily sleeps the seven people we had for our bachelor party. South Congress Street is a very cool area to be in and there are a lot of places to explore. It is walking distance to downtown and to Sixth Street. A very fun area to be and Heather simply made it even more awesome!
,,,,,,,,"Heather is amazing! So hospitable, welcoming, and all around AWESOME! She helped plan our itinerary and made sure we had the best possible weekend. Her apartment is beautiful and perfect for a large group. Great location! Great amenities! Thanks Heather! "
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a very helpful host, providing loads of information before and during the stay about the property and Austin. The property was large and clean and in a very good location for a night in downtown and boozy brunch the morning after."
,,,,,,,,"I didn't actually meet Heather but she was the most amazing host for my group of 8 girls. She responds within an hour and is very accommodating. We came in on a Friday evening and everything was ready for us -- including some additional refreshments suitable for a bachelorette party ;). The beds were very comfortable and two of the girls opted to sleep on the (huge) couch -- which was also very comfortable. The location couldn't have been better - we were within walking distance of amazing food trucks, ice cream, coffee, and bars. Thank you Heather!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Heather was very accommodating to our needs, allowing us to check in and check out with a lot of flexibility. Her place was clean and comfortably fit the 8 people who were in my party. The apartments location is great as it's right on one of the most popular streets, S. Congress, and a short 5 minute ($7) Uber/Lyft to most areas of DT for nightlight. Lastly, the apartment was a great value considering the space and location. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"We've never met Heather in person, but she's always available through texts and she responds very quickly! I love how she thoughtfully organized everything to welcome the guests; you can easily find everything you would need in the house. I unexpectedly had to request for additional parking permit in the morning (my arrival was in the evening on the same day), and she took care of it in a minute!
Comfy beds and spacious sofa -- her apartment is perfect for groups. Highly recommended not only because it's a terrific apartment, but also because it's hosted by an excellent host.

Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
,,,,,,,,"Heather was incredible to work with. She was quick to respond, very courteous, hospitable  and a pleasure to deal with.

Her home was very comfortable and suitably located. 

We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to our next trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Both Heather and her apartment were amazing!  The place was even better than she described.  My friends and I stayed in the apartment for the second weekend of ACL, and everyone agreed that it was perfect.  Heather was an extremely gracious host, and even dropped off some rain ponchos when it was a little rainy on the second day of the festival.  Perfect experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Heather was an amazing hostess for us during our trip to Austin. The apartment was beautiful, spacious, and centrally located. Heather could not have been more helpful, warm, and welcoming. She was always available if we ever needed anything. 

It felt as though we were staying with a family member or friend! I would highly recommend staying at this location for anyone looking to stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Heather was an excellent host. Although we did not meet her in person, she was easily reachable by phone, responded very quickly to my emails, and provided help and assistance whenever I needed it. I really felt at home in her apartment, which was very nice, clean, and well-located. It was a little tight for 11 guys, but Heather provided us with enough air mattresses to compensate."
,,,,,,,,"Although we never met in person Heather was great.  She had the place all set for us including a great welcome book with maps and guides.  The listing is extremely accurate although the photos don't show how nice her outdoor sitting area is.  It has flower beds and a grill!  She was very receptive to any questions we had. 

The location is maybe one of the best in Austin.  It is a super short walk to the cool shops of SoCo where there are 2 B-cycle bikeshare kiosks which allow you to get all around the city.  Its also just a very short walk to see the Bats on the Congress bridge and to downtown. "
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a great host!  She was easy to get in contact with and answered all our questions super quickly.  Her place was just as described on her page.  The beds and couch were super comfy, and the space was a great fit for our party of 9 girls.  We had an awesome time and would definitely recommend Heather and her place to anyone!!  "
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a very welcoming host!  Everything was described exactly how she says and it is fully stocked with practically everything that you would need.  Conveniently located near the infamous 6th Street, this is an ideal place for families, birthday get togethers, and bachelor/ bachelorette parties to reside while in Austin.  A+!"
,,,,,,,,"Heather and her place were both equally awesome! She made everything incredibly easy for us, gave us the lay of the land and helped out wherever she could. We had a package shipped to her place before and it was waiting for us when we arrived. We had access to a Jeep which made getting little things a lot easier and the complex she's in has a great pool, busy with people on the weekends. I recommend Heather's place to anyone looking into travelling to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Heather's place was so well located, and she responded to all my texts almost too quickly!! We had an amazing time, she did actually make austin more fun, which we thought was impossible, glad we found her, please make any excuse to stay here!!!
"
,,,,,,,,We had the best experience working with Heather. She is very quick with communication and truly wants her home to be your home. She goes above and beyond to meet any need her guests have. Heather's apartment is very nice and she takes very great care of it.  We were able to fit 15 girls with no problem.  The neighborhood is a perfect location to get downtown and any major highway in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Heather was a great host. We started communicating shortly after I booked her location via email and text. She was very responsive and helpful. Her welcome letter had all the information you would need for your stay. The apartments location was perfect as it was very close to downtown and 6th street. Conformable beds, clean bathrooms and very spacious for our larger party. Having a jeep included with the stay was a deal that you will not be able to find anywhere else. Being able to cruise through Austin in the jeep made the trip so much more fantastic. Thanks so much Heather!"
,,,,,,,,Heather was a wonderful host who went above and beyond to ensure that we had everything we needed. The apartment was larger than it appeared to be in the pictures (a very nice surprise) and walking distance to tons of food and nightlife. I would highly recommend staying at Heathers place. If you're not sure about booking: do yourself a favor and book now. You won't be disappointed. 
,,,,,,,,"Heather was as good a host as a guest could ask for. The apartment is exactly as represented and she is extremely hospitable. She was accessible and friendly and the location is outstanding. The apartment is well-maintained, has nice amenities, and is very spacious. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to explore Austin and Heather provides everything you could ask for! Thank you Heather!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place, even better host!  The apartment was nice and clean and accommodated 10 guys easily.  Location was good with easy access to 6th street, cabs and buses.  

But the best part was Heather!  She was super responsive and helpful and we could tell she really cared about us having a great time on our trip.  She even helped us find a last minute boat reservation and gave us advice on restaurants/bars.  Our trip wouldn't have been the same without her!  "
,,,,,,,,"It was exactly as represented, maybe a little better.  Loved the host.  Heather was extremely accomodating.  We ended up fitting about 11 people in the house and it was great.  Heather was always there to help throughout the weekend and seemed very concerned that we had an awesome time in her home."
,,,,,,,,"Heather not only has a beautiful place with a perfect location, but she proved to be such a fabulous host!  We communicated prior to and all throughout our stay -- always detailed and timely in her response.  We felt right at home in her clean home.  Her hospitality to stock the fridge prior to was such a convenience saver.

To anyone interested in a quaint stay in Austin, this is your place!

Thank you for opening up your home for our first visit in Austin.  Hope to be back soon!"
,,,,,,,,"To say that Heather was our SXSW hero would be an understatement, she was more than amazing! The apartment was great and accommodated us perfectly. It's at walking distance from downtown which helps a lot when you need to get back home during the festival. "
,,,,,,,,Heather was fantastic. Not only was she very easy to coordinate with but she even picked up breakfast supplies for us. I would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Awesome place - well stocked, great with letting us in, really can't ask for anything else.  Thanks for being a great host!  "
15132809,4.5,10,10,9,9,10,9,"Sophie and Grace were fantastic! They were overly accommodating when I had something come up and went above and beyond to make me feel welcome. Their apartment is a 10-15 minute walk from downtown and a fraction of the price of any nearby hotels. Sunday, their cat, was a gentle and loving creature that made an already awesome experience even better. If you're contemplating booking elsewhere, I would advise you to stop looking and book here. It was perfect! "
,,,,,,,,"El departamento esta cerca del centro en coche. Basicamente si no quieres una opcion barata en Austin esta bien, solo tienes que compartir el bano con el otro cuarto y el depa es muy sencillo. Sin embargo por el precio es lo que esperaba. "
,,,,,,,,"Sophie and Grace were very welcoming and accommodating - even Sunday the cat is friendly :) The place is clean and as described, with a comfy bed."
,,,,,,,,Had a great time at Sophie's apartment.  The hosts are so nice and accommodating - including picking up some tasty gelato for me  - and are also great communicators.  I'll definitely stay here again as needed. 
,,,,,,,,"Sophie is a really great host, very flexible with check-in and check-out time, the appartment is very well situated and it was very easy to communicate with her.
"
,,,,,,,,"Great location and hosts! Stayed here for ACL weekend and Sophie was very accommodating, even though we were coming into the apartment at pretty late hours after coming back from the festival. The room was functional and clean, would repeat. "
15020172,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,This Airbnb worked great for us! It was a family trip with 2 couples. It was great to have a place with 2 bedrooms with attached baths.  We loved the his neighborhood of mostly older husband mes. The location was so central to all  of Austin that we could get everywhere easily and quickly. Eric was very responsive to any questions. We had a great time in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Nice location and a very cosy place. Beds and couch were very comfy. Shampoo, shower gel and conditioner was provided ... which my friend loved :-) we spend an amazing NYs weekend here. Thanks"
,,,,,,,,"This is the second time I've stayed in Eric's ""Sweet Place"". It's clean, two queen beds, two full baths, nice kitchen and living area, but for our needs, it's so nice and close to downtown-Rainy St. and 6th...never more than an $8 cab ride.  It's very quiet too.  Eric is quick to get back to his guests as well.  Will definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,The place is perfectly located in Clarksville and exactly as pictured. We were able to walk to many places we wanted to go. It worked very well for our family of 3. Everything about it was easy. 
,,,,,,,,This was an awesome place to stay in. Definitely way better than a Hotel and it has everything that you need. Also it was in a great location. Will love to stay here again when i come back to Austin TX
,,,,,,,,"Great place in a great location. Spacious, modern, clean, well equipped. We didn't stay all that long, but absolutely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"Exactly as advertised, and a great spot from which to explore the city.  Clean, modern, well equipped."
,,,,,,,,"A great location, nestled in a quiet neigborhood!"
,,,,,,,,Eric'a place was great! Centrally located and everything I needed for a couple nights' stay.  
,,,,,,,,"From the minute we made arrangements he was always on top of everything making changes to our original stay to sending us excellent information needed at arrival
We had a water leak and he was there within hours to check it out"
,,,,,,,,"Eric's place was great! Spacious, yet cozy and $7 fare to hot spots in Austin! Very clean, parking and quiet! Loved it and will definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Quick and easy check in and check out. The apartment was as described and in good, clean condition. Each bedroom has its own attached bathroom which made it the perfect accommodation for our travel needs. "
,,,,,,,,"Exactly as advertised!  Loved everything about this place.   Two bedroom, two bathroom unit with top notch amenities 

Central location was perfect to use rideshare  to go downtown, to the campus and all other plans.

Will definitely look for the availability of Eric's place for our next trip!"
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood in which this place is located is absolutely adorable. Prime real estate all around. Fell in love with just about every home lol 

Plenty of wonderful shops and eateries within close proximity and an easy share ride into downtown Austin

The property itself is well kept with nice and tastefully done interior. Loved the large separate rooms with private baths.

Definitely would stay again & highly recommend this property if you are looking for a place in Austin :)"
,,,,,,,,"Marvelous! Super convenient location, clean, modern. Eric responded very quickly to messages and gave us plenty of information about things to do. Our group of four had a great time in Austin. I would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Great place!  About 25 min walk to downtown or a 7 min cab ride.  Would definitely recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time while staying here.  House was in a great location, clean and close to everything.  Would recommend staying here for anyone coming to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay! The house is comfortable, clean and in a great neighborhood. I was able to walk to nearby restaurants, coffee shops and a very convenient grocery store. 

The place is a 5 minute walk from a great park, peefect for my morning runs. 

I highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"I only have great things to say about my experience with Eric and this listing.

Eric's place was an amazing find for our visit to Austin during Austin City Limits. The apartment was spacious, comfortable, and modern with all the necessary amenities, perfect for our group of four festival-going adults. The beds and couch are very comfortable and the bathrooms are clean and roomy with great showers. This is essential when you're dirty and tired from going to the festival and bars all day and require a good night's rest for the marathon of an ACL weekend. Its in a great neighborhood that's close to Zilker and essentially central to anywhere else worth visiting in Austin. 

As far as Eric, what a great and accommodating host. He gave timely and clear communication and was very hospitable, even without ever seeing him in person. Austin is a city with many, many hidden gems when it comes to local flavor and even if you do extensive internet research before visiting, nothing beats a local's word of mouth; Eric provided many great recommendations to local attractions and eateries, many that we hadn't come across, which only validated the places we shared with him. 

Eric went above and beyond what was required in a host. We were so fortunate to have found Eric and his listing and it made our visit to Austin that much better.

TL;DR: Eric is the real MVP."
,,,,,,,,"Eric is a great host and provides us with a ton of great info about things to do in the area. He made arrival very easy and the place was exactly as pictured, and very clean. Would absolutely recommend staying here and would do it again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great spot! Comfortable place if you need two beds that's in a great neighborhood close to Austin but maybe bring your own linens. Both bed sheets were washed but had stains on them. One of the towels was also stained.

5 stars with new linens!"
,,,,,,,,"Very responsive host.  The apartment is modern, clean and tidy.  It is in a great safe neighborhood  in a very convenient location!"
7826574,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Margaux was sublime. She was hands down the most hospitable Airbnb host I have ever had. The place was clean, quiet, and in a great location. I had a great time in Austin and plan to stay here if I return."
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was an excellent hostess. She offered to do some grocery shopping at Trader Joe's for me, and whatever is Margaux's is yours as well. She can tell you anything about downtown Austinâ€”bars, places to eat, places to shop, etc. She's an excellent conversationalist, and will make you feel very comfortable. If you need privacy, Margaux will go out of her way to provide it to you. Unfortunately, I was only in Austin for work, so I couldn't take advantage of Margaux's full hospitality. 

The apartment is super close to the Austin Convention Center, so it's a great place to stay for business trips. But if I ever visit Austin for a personal vacation, Margaux's place will be the place to stay for sure, and I'll get to see Austin ""the Margaux way""."
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was an absolutely awesome host!  Probably the best host I'll ever have on Airbnb.  Super chill and down to Earth person.  She made sure everything was provided to have a good time.  The location in Austin is absolutely prime.  If you can get the parking space at the condo it's perfect.  If not, you just do the Marriott parking on the other side of the block and you're set.  The condo's on the smaller side, but it has everything you'll need.  You'll be able to walk to all the best parts of Austin from the doorstep; it's smack dab in the heart of downtown.  I didn't need to use my car once during the three day weekend.  Didn't even need to use an uber or a taxi the entire weekend.  Awesome host, awesome location, in an awesome city.  I look forward to coming back and staying here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This stay was exactly what I was looking for.  The location was perfect, the location quiet, and the apartment clean and inviting.  While the setting was intimate, Margaux was super friendly and respectful; basically the ideal host."
,,,,,,,,"Margaux was a great host, very hospitable, helpful and energetic. Went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed and gave me the lay of the land. The space was clean and comfortable, with table/chairs outside to enjoy the sunshine."
8225133,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great place! Bryan gives you little snacks like Oreoes, Cheese its and Cookies plus little bottles of water. There is a fairly large mini fridge in room with a tv. The bed was comfy and bathroom very clean. Bryan didnt have to lift a finger. We never even meet him and yet all we our needs were anticipated before hand. Well played sir!"
,,,,,,,,Perfect host! Really comunicative and precise. The room was very nice and clean and we really loved the candy and chocolate basket next to our bed and the choice of movies.
,,,,,,,,"Thank you, Bryan! We enjoyed the stay very much!"
,,,,,,,,Centrally-located yet residential and quiet. We def. enjoyed our stay. Thank you! 
,,,,,,,,"The house is awesome, for that it is in the safe district and the houseowner is super nice! It's my fault that I oredered wrong day and waste one night. However, Bryan gave that part of money back to me in cash. I was moved when I entered into the house in late night , all the lights and air conditioning on are on. Bryan also prepared the snacks and red wine for me. This house is definitely my best choice."
,,,,,,,,"The stay at Bryan's was really uncomplicated and nice. The bed was decent and he added nice touches to make us feel welcome, like a basket filled with candy and small water bottles. Next time I'm in Austin I will stay with him again. "
,,,,,,,,Close to downtown and very tidy with all the accommodations! 
,,,,,,,,"Bryan's place is fantastic! Clean, cozy, and has everything you could need on a trip to Austin! We didn't get to meet Bryan in person, but he was super responsive with communication, made check-in/out painless, and we felt right at home in his pad. My favorite thing was the incredible bathroom lighting - sounds silly, but it made doing my makeup/hair a breeze! It's all about the details. I also loved Bryan's little touches around the place: snacks in the bedroom, beers in the mini fridge, super soft sheets, a bevvy of shower products in the bathroom, and Austin art on the walls. It made our quick overnighter in the city an effortless blast. Great location too, easy to traverse downtown, minutes from great shops and restaurants including a short stint to Mozart's Coffee Shop for their Christmas light show! Plenty of street parking for the automotive-inclined as well. Would absolutely recommend Bryan's place, not to mention it's the bargain-of-the-century. "
,,,,,,,,Bryan is very considerate in keeping his guest comfortable and his place was very clean.
,,,,,,,,Bryan was a kind and interesting human of the highest order.   He is an excellent host and an inspiring person.   
,,,,,,,,"Bryan's place was very neat and cozy; instructions were incredibly easy to follow. Was only there for one night, but had no problems at all--would definitely recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Great room with a very comfortable bed! Bryan provided snacks and drinks in the room, and had a bathroom stocked with extra shampoo and conditioner if you happen to forget yours. Really close to delicious restaurants and easy walking distance to downtown, but a very quiet, peaceful neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, private space. Bryan left easy directions to get to/ into the apartment. I wasn't in the apartment much but it was a good place to crash for the night. Bryan left snacks which was a good touch. Easy walk/drive into Downtown. "
,,,,,,,,Super close to 6th Street. Very clean and everything we needed! Very good price for the stay!
,,,,,,,,Thank you Bryan! Great stay for last minute place needed :)
,,,,,,,,Thanks for opening up your home to us Bryan! Even though we didn't have a ton of time to get to know each other it was very easy and nice stay at your place :) 
,,,,,,,,love your big TV
,,,,,,,,"Bryan is a great host! His place is clean and in a great neighborhood. Also, the snacks are awesome! I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Great spot!
,,,,,,,,"Perfect! Nice location. Great walk to downtown. Easy to get a ride to/from nightlife. Will be recommending Bryan's place to friends taking trips to Austin!
"
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was a great host and communicated very well! His place was clean, convenient and perfect for my quick stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,We stayed with Bryan for 2 nights and he saved us last minute because we booked for another AirBnB in town but when we arrived there it smelled gross and we decided not to stay there. So we arrived late in the evening at Bryan`s place. Everything was clean and tidy. Bryan was at work but wrote us how to enter the apartment. We never met Bryan in person because when we got up he was already at work and when he came back we were already in our room but we are sure he is a nice guy. 
,,,,,,,,Bryan's place is super cute and in a good area. We walked to a nearby restaurant and if you don't mind a small trek it was really easy to walk downtown too. Bryan was a nice guy and a good host. 
,,,,,,,,"Had a very good experience. 
This was my first time using Airbnb so I was a little concerned at first.
It all went out really smoothly and the host, Bryan, is super fun to talk to.
Will definitely come back again when I am traveling to Austin next time."
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was an amazing host: he knew he would be unavailable for my arrival, and prepared in advance everything that would make this a smooth transition. He was easy to get along with, full of fantastic suggestions of things to see and do in Austin. The neighbourhood was cute and charming; cafes, bistros and a small grocery store just a few blocks away. For those who like to walk - it is an easy 30 min walk to downtown Austin. There are bus stops close by, and overall I found the local metro system easy and convenient to use. If you don't want to take the bus or walk, it was only a 5-10 dollars fasten ride, depending on where you want to go. Would come back again! "
,,,,,,,,"Even though Bryan was gone, he made sure we had everything we needed. The room was just big enough for a quick overnight stay and it was nice and clean. "
,,,,,,,,Very nice place to stay. Communication with Bryan is fast and easy. Accommodations were clean and tidy. I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Great visit to Austin. Nice place -- clean, short cab ride or a ~30 minute walk from UT Austin. Bryan sent detailed instructions since he wasn't going be there when I arrived, and was friendly once he returned. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place and perfect room.
It was easy to find the place but be aware you may be on your own if lost cause the owner was not there and it was hard to communicate with him.
Clean bed sheets were ready but I had to put myself on the bed  as the owner didn't clean home after the previous guest.

All in all great place for the price and great amenities."
,,,,,,,,"Brian was away when we stayed but his place is fantastic. Nice clean room, about 10 mins to get to the start of downtown then 20 mins walk to east 6th st.
More so he provided water, wine and more small amenities than most 4 star hotels!"
,,,,,,,,The place was great and in an amazing part of town!
,,,,,,,,"Awesome place, host goes above and beyond, and has a great place to stay in Austin. Totally recommended.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great experience, excellent location, very affordable and a very responsive host. Didn't get to meet Bryan but he made my stay really a breeze. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"Upon arrival the place was extremely neat & very welcoming. The location was amazing, great neighborhood & perfect spot to catch a taxi downtown. "
,,,,,,,,Nice place. Comfortable bed. Good communication from the host
,,,,,,,,What we loved about the place was that it was extremely clean and cozy. We were tired after a long day of sightseeing and we were more than glad to be back to the room. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable room.
,,,,,,,,"Bryan has a comfortable lower level apartment offering in an upscale Austin neighborhood. The room is large and well provisioned. Bryan even had snacks in the room for his guests including nuts which was a pleasant surprise for someone who doesn't eat candy. That consideration is evidenced throughout his listing and I found Bryan to be kind, caring and attentive to my needs during my stay.

The room had lots of outlets and ceiling fan both of which were much appreciated.

I recommend Bryan's listing to those venturing to the weird world of Austin, TX."
,,,,,,,,"I had such a good time staying at Bryan's place. Bryan is a very friendly and welcoming guy who even took the time to show me Some very Nice places in Austin. His place is neat and clean, and located in a beautiful neighbourhood close to all main attractions in Austin. I would definitely stay here again if I have the chance. Thanks Bryan! "
,,,,,,,,"Bryan's place had everything we needed for a comfortable stay in Austin. Parking was easy, the bed was comfy, and the room was clean. Bryan even left some popcorn and tea for guests to enjoy, along with a TV equipped with Netflix for relaxing. Finally, the house was close to Rainey St and Downtown: both about 10 minutes away or less without traffic. Thanks, Bryan!"
,,,,,,,,"Very easy check in, great location, very quiet and safe neighborhood, really good value"
,,,,,,,,"Great room, great price! I didn't interact with Bryan in person at all, but his check in and out instructions were clear. The room was clean and comfortable. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was a great host! He couldn't be at the apartment much during our stay, but he made sure to prepare for us since we wouldn't catch him when we got into town. The location is peaceful and the bed was comfortable! It's a straight shot if you exit 15th from 35, which made our traveling around town quick and efficient! "
,,,,,,,,Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our overnight trip to Austin. The location is excellent and the area is nice. Bryan has a very nice place and for the price you seriously cannot beat it. Very happy with our experience and hope to stay again in the future!
,,,,,,,,"Was able to check in a bit early, and everything was simple and as described. Neighbourhood was charming and even though sidewalks disappear (no fault of the host, obviously), I could easily walk to some cool spots. Had an amazing time in Austin and would stay here again if I ever come back. Bryan was a great host--recommend :-)"
,,,,,,,,"We had a fantastic time and the place couldn't have been better. Room was exactly what we needed - a place to crash after a long day of concerts. Room had plenty of ammendities, bottle water, fridge. Bryan had great communication regarding check in. Although our paths didn't cross, he was very welcoming and answered all messages quickly. A+ time, would recommend to others."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Bryans was wonderful, I was only there for a couple of nights but it was comfortable and uncomplicated! I highly recommend Bryan's place to anyone visiting Austin. "

,,,,,,,,"Very great place! I love that it was super close to downtown. Super clean and well stocked, love the mini fridge in the room."
,,,,,,,,It was exactly what we needed. We were in town for a concert and just needed somewhere to lay our head. Bryan was cordial and was attentive to needs.
,,,,,,,,"Bryan made sure we were taken care of even before we arrived and was communicative with instructions to check in. Room had more than everything we needed and Bryan made us feel more like a casual roommate then someone staying in his space for the night. Location was in a peaceful neighborhood close enough to walk, taxi, or bus anywhere in downtown austin quickly. Would stay here again no problem."
,,,,,,,,Cozy spot centrally located.  Fun time exploring Austin on my mother-daughter weekend road trip!  Bryan was a great host.
,,,,,,,,Everything was setup when I arrived. It was clean and Bryan was able to host on short notice.

,,,,,,,,"TyvÃ¤rr var Bryan bortrest under vÃ¥r vistelse, men kommunikationen med honom funkade bra. SjÃ¤lva lÃ¤genheten var pÃ¥ ett kanonstÃ¤lle och i bra skick med alla bekvÃ¤mligheter som annonserad."

,,,,,,,,"Bryan was super helpful and gave very specific details about his space, how to get to there & even shared weather updates. It was a quiet, cozy stay in a great location.  I sent Bryan a message shortly after I left his place & he notified me that I left my Invisalign set behind (super expensive & super important)  I was halfway home on a 2.5 hour drive. Super bummed because I always do multiple room checks before I leave an Airbnb/hotel and I wasn't able to turn around due to work. I asked if he could mail it to me and he said YES!!!!! I'm super thankful he was willing to do that because I don't think many people would. I recommend Bryan 100% Great stay and obviously a good person."

,,,,,,,,"Bryan was a great host. He met us to check in early, let us leave our bags for the afternoon on the day we checked out and generally was very accommodating. The mini-fridge was stocked with cold water and juice, as well as snacks on the bedside table. You also have about 20 different bathroom products to choose from, as well as fresh towels and linens. The apartment is also across the street form the 18 bus line, which is a few minutes ride to the Capital building. The neighborhood also has a lot of coffee shops and restaurants. Bryan is a consummate pro, and we will definitely stay again in Austin. "

Very easy to find and checkin was simple. Bryan was a great host and helped me with anything I needed. When back in Austin I would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin and enjoyed being so close to downtown (only 25 minute walk).  We were however somewhat disappointed with the cleanliness in the bathroom and the front entry.  The toilet had not been cleaned and the bathroom tile was cracked and moldy.  We met Bryan very briefly, and when we did, he had nothing to say to us and we didn't feel welcomed.  We felt like we were intruders.   On a positive note, the room itself was very comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay with Bryan was so perfect. Getting in was easy and the condition of the room was excellent. Unfortunately we didn't get to see Bryan, but we were so impressed with his organization and presentation of his space. I will most likely stay with Bryan on all my future visits to Austin."

,,,,,,,,"Bryan accepted our request to stay with him last minute, which was such a life saver as we had been driving across the country and never really knew when we would need a place to stay. He made sure that the room was clean and ready for us to arrive (which it was). He accommodated our schedule and had no issue with the strange hour of arrival. His home is clean and inviting and has a beautiful kitchen area equipped with everything you may need to make a small meal. The room is open and spacious -- definitely enough for two people. "
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we could possibly ask for. The house is nice and clean, very close to downtown yet in a quiet residential neighborhood. We had a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Stayed for a week. Bryan was very nice and accommodating. The apartment was kept clean with plenty of clean sheets and towel.
The area was about a 5 min cab from downtown or an easy jog."
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was a great host. I never met him in person, yet he let me know when the room was ready earlier than posted check in time, and he made sure I knew how to get in and check out. I found a nice hand written note from Bryan outside my door in the am - the only reason I knew he had come and gone. The apartment is cozy and quiet and had everything I needed. Bed was comfortable with a selection of pillows. Nice to have a TV and mini fridge in the bedroom, lots of closet space, great shower head in the bath and a well stocked kitchen. The driveway is circular and spacious. The neighborhood is amazingly quiet and beautiful - so close to the hustle and bustle of Austin and the university. Highly recommend, and I would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was great! Although I didn't get to meet Bryan, he was very easy to communicate with, his place was exactly as described, and in a perfect location. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be close to the downtown area but away from the noise. It was very comfortable and quiet. We were provided with everything we needed and more! "

Bryan keeps a neat, clean, cute apartment with a very comfortable bed, lots of privacy and access to the full kitchen is a big plus when you're on a tight budget.  Bryan is a great host, accommodating, helpful and friendly.   I wanted for nothing here and I hope to come back to Austin again and stay here.  Thanks so much Bryan for your hospitality!"

,,,,,,,,Bryan contacted us with all the details of how to check in since he wouldn't be there. He was so detailed and friendly! He even offered us the wine in his curio. This is a great location if you want to be near west 6th street. It's also steps away from some really cute restaurants and bars. There was a mini fridge in our room with drinks! Everything was wonderful. 
,,,,,,,,"Very comfortable space, plenty of privacy.  Bryan is a respectful and friendly host. The location is ideal, and I couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. Thanks for everything, I hope to come back soon!"
,,,,,,,,"It seemed to be a quiet neighborhood.
The listing features a big house in the images. To clarify, the room is not really in the house. The host has an apartment in the basement of this house and the bedroom is in this apartment. It was not very clean and the shower was very moldy. He also didn't make us feel very welcome.
Nevertheless, the host acknowledged the cleaning issues and accepted to refund us."
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was extremely helpful, knowledgeable  and generous. He offered to drive us to downtown and gave us everything we needed for our road trip. The apartment was beautiful and nicely furnished. We were able to hang out in our room with our own mini fridge, TV, and extremely comfortable bed or enjoy the rest of the apartment. We all ended hanging out and had a great time."
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was clean and comfortable, and quite accessible to downtown area.
Brian was very responsive and accommodating!"
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was extremely approachable and keeps a cozy living space. The cable and wifi kept my girlfriend and I plenty busy while we were there. It was a mere five minute drive into downtown Austin, which was perfect for me since I had a show to attend there. Comfortable bed, closet space, and an inviting host sealed the deal here. Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the Austin area. "

,,,,,,,,"Friendly, nice room, clean and went out of the way to make the stay pleasant. I didn't stay long, but for what I needed it was great. Good location too. "
,,,,,,,,Had a fantastic stay at Bryan's place. He's an excellent host and a really nice guy. The apartment is impeccably clean with a huge comfy bed and a TV that has over 400 channels... unreal! The neighborhood and the location couldnâ€™t have been better. Itâ€™s an easy 5 min. walk to some cool shops and bars and roughly 20-25 min. walk to the heart of downtown or the UT campus. Bryan gave me plenty of good recommendations and was helpful throughout. Iâ€™d definitely recommend it and I hope I get back someday soon.    
,,,,,,,,"Bryan was a fantastic host! We so appreciate the bottle of wine he shared with us upon arrival, and he had wonderful insights about what to do and where to go during our stay in Austin. We loved the location, too. Next time we come back to Austin, we're booking with Bryan again for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"Bryan, you are a very kind and friendly hoster, you were quite attentive to us whenever we need. The room was exactly as described, the house is quiet and marvel neighborhood.

Overall great value."
,,,,,,,,"I booked this stay for my Fiance and I but unfortunately I got called out to work in West Texas so it was only my Fiance who stayed with Byran.  She had nothing but good things to say about her visit, Bryan was very responsive on getting us booked and my gal loved his place.  She thought the location was perfect, she got to take a nice morning walk down to the river before going to her work out class and then stopped for breakfast on the way back, she requested we make our future stays with Bryan so that's what we will be doing!"
,,,,,,,,Just in for a quick one night stay.  Bryan was quite flexible about arrival.  Chatted with him a bit -- very nice guy.  Nice room in quite neighborhood; appreciated the fridge with water.  
,,,,,,,,Great place great host perfect distance to all the major attractions.
,,,,,,,,"A lovely room in a lovely area. Bryan gave us plenty of space when we wanted privacy but was also happy to hang out and chat about Austin and wider world events.

,,,,,,,,"Bryan was a fantastic host. Great communication made the ""check-in"" seemless and we even had a couple bottles of water and Christmas cookies on our nightstand when we got there. Everything was 100% as pictured and the neighborhood was very safe with easy parking. Bryan knows his stuff when it comes to Austin too and helped make some awesome restaurant choices. I'd reccomend this place in a heartbeat. "

It was my first airbnb but I felt like it was an easy experience.

The bed was extremely comfortable too, and while we did not make use of this, there was a TV with cable in the room for us to use as well. There were even laundry machines that were easy access!

His location is prime if trying to be close to the heart of downtown Austin. It was easy for us to get anywhere we wanted and it was less than a 10 dollar Lyft ride away.

,,,,,,,,A great house located close to downtown. Modern and open; it's perfect for hanging out with some friends or having a more formal meeting.
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful stay in Austin. Highly recommend. The house is modern, uncluttered and has a chef's kitchen. Great East Austin location. Crystal's communication made the check-in and check-out super easy. Something to note, the mattresses felt like IKEA or similar quality. "
,,,,,,,,"I'd love to stay here again.  Great house, convenient location.  Nicely decorated, lots of space and amazingly clean.

Ran in the mornings down to and along the river which is only a few blocks from the house.

Walked to downtown (6th street) in less than 15 minutes.  More restaurants and bars close by than one can count in a lifetime.

"

,,,,,,,,"Had a wonderful time staying with crystal. The house is absolutely incredible, very clean, and well stocked with all that you would need. Excellent location! Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay at Crystal's home. From the location to the amenities, the Artist's Retreat could not have been better. Crystal's directions made everything easy and we also used her fantastic restaurant recommendations. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to spend some time in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is even nicer than it looks in the pictures.  It is incredibly stylish and new.  The location is easily walkable to lots of cool local attractions but is still quiet and not too ""in the thick of it"".

I've stayed at other places hosted by Crystal and she continues to define herself as Austin's best host!  If you get a chance, stay with her!

Andrew"
,,,,,,,,"Crystal left us a great list of restaurants and bars in the area--as we were on a ""research and development"" trip for our own restaurants.  A lovely bottle of Malbec was also waiting for us when we arrived.  The one time we needed to communicate about a breaker being tripped, she got back to us in a timely fashion!  I also thought I left a shirt and she was super responsive about that as well-- p.s. I found the shirt in my bag. :)  Overall, quick walk to and from Rainey Street, super spacious and clean home.  Would definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,"Myself and two of my colleagues stayed here for a 4 day business trip. The property is a fantastic 3 bedroom house in a very convenient location close to Rainey Street and other busy areas.

Crystal was the perfect host, clear communication throughout and a pleasure to deal with.

I would stay here again when visiting Austin so I highly recommend it.

"
,,,,,,,,"Crystal was an excellent host from the second this location was booked! She was very easy to get a hold of and willing to help with any questions we had, prior to, and once we arrived at the location. She offered plenty of activities and food options around the area which were a tremendous help. The house itself is an amazing brand new structure with superb amenities and with 3 bedrooms and 3 queen beds it can easily accommodate a medium-large group of people. It's located right next to Rainey St. which made it very accessible to the nearby bars and nightlife. Garage parking was definitely a plus too. I know for sure that my next visit to ATX will be spent in this house and look forward to booking with Crystal again! "
5510293,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Amazing location, very centrally located, great for exploring Austin. This apartment, located below the main house also rented by Airbnb guests, is really close to Zilker Park, great bars and restaurants, but it feels private and secluded in a way that's great for a little R&R. The apartment is nicely designed, minimalist, and perfect for  two. There is a pull out sofa, a great shower, and street parking in the cute neighborhood where this place is located. Would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exactly as described, very cute and comfortable. Walking distance to good restaurants and close to Zilker Park and downtown. "
,,,,,,,,"We wanted a nice staycation for our wedding anniversary. One in which we could walk to the Trail of Lights.  This location was perfect for that, the space was big for 2 people. The bed was very comfy. Adam was so accommodating and kind. This is a very unique and we would stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is great, in a nice, safe neighborhood. Everything was as advertised, Adam even stopped by after I arrived to make sure I had everything I needed and explain a couple of things. I will definitely be staying here again, as I'm in Austin often for work"
,,,,,,,,"We didn't meet Adam in person, but he reached out before we arrived, asked us if we got there okay or needed anything and offered tips of where to go, and checked in again before we left.  If we'd had any questions, I was confident that he would have answered them, but the binder in the kitchen had all of the info we needed.  We didn't rent a car for our stay, and had no problem using the RideAustin shared ride service to get everywhere we wanted to go.  The apartment is the lower floor of a REALLY cool house (I would have loved to see the rest!).  We did hear some footsteps and voices from the folks upstairs (not what they were saying; just voices), but it really wasn't a problem.  The place was cute and modern and had everything we needed for our 4 nights, including nice heavy extra blankets for when the temperature dropped, and instructions for the ductless heater/air conditioners and even for the Apple TV.  The terrazzo floors were COLD, though, so if you come at a cool time of year, bring slippers or fuzzy socks.  The bed was comfy--on the firmer side, but within my tolerance, and I prefer a soft bed.  "
,,,,,,,,"Adam and his wife made it super easy to come and go. They were very flexible to work with and offered great tips on the surronding area. They even loaned us their bikes for a trip into downtown! The neighborhood is very quiet, though a short bike ride or car ride to much of Austin, including great parks. There's essentials within walking distance too, including a very nice coffee shop. The apartment worked well for us. It was very clean and had plenty of space to make breakfast and hang out with a friend who came in town for the day to see us. They were great hosts and I'd recommend staying at Adam's place."
,,,,,,,,Great stay and Adam is a wonderful host
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful space, tucked away and quiet neighborhood, yet close to all the action downtown. Car share services have no trouble finding the place, and most everywhere near downtown is under $8, so that's cool. I recommend this place highly, very good value and great location!"
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I came into town from Dallas for a concert at Emo's. Great place in a great area. Plenty of options within walking distance or short cab rides to south congress or downtown. If it's available, reserve it now! Don't waste your money on high priced hotels downtown. Adam gave us all the info we needed and was very helpful.  We would be happy to stay again."
,,,,,,,,Very nice stay with a short walk to great food and coffee. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,This is an awesome home in an awesome neighborhood. Walking distance to great food and things to do! Adam was super attentive and quick to respond to any questions. Very quiet and safe neighborhood that we enjoyed walking around. 
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at this apartment was a very good experience overall.  The neighborhood is very nice and quite, parking is not an issue, close distance to downtown and other sites of interest, like coffee shops!
Features of the apt. are as described, efficient and prompt communication.  We will definitely consider -and recommend- staying at this location when visiting Austin again."
,,,,,,,,"This was such an amazing find - extremely clean, beautiful place, wonderful location and great hosts! Super close to anything you want to do in Austin, and in a great, safe neighborhood. Highly recommend!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Spectacular location that is private, close to downtown, and within walking distance to some great restaurants (Uchi, Vox, and Odd Duck) and a short car ride to the areas best food trucks). We were also able to run from the apartment to the riverside park for a couple runs. Enjoyed having a full size refrigerator and stove. The bed was comfortable and super firm. The shower was great and we loved the haiku fans in the living room and bedroom. Although the patio was extremely inviting the outdoor furniture was rusty and should be replaced.  Overall, a wonderful stay and Adam made sure we had what we needed and even surprised us with wine on our arrival. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam a great guy. Shored up the early confusion. 

Perhaps shouldn't show picture of front of House to avoid any awkward conversations with the renters in the main building. 

All In all, decent value and location is good. "
,,,,,,,,Adam was a great host and the space was wonderful. Location was central and we had everything we needed. Would recommend anyone who is visiting Austin to stay here
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was a very clean and pleasant apartment for two people. Whilst the neighbourhood is quiet, there was quite a bit of noise from the unit above but he had left out ear plugs if that is a concern for some. Otherwise a great place to stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean, convenient.  Great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Our host was in constant contact with us since day one. We appreciated his timely responses! The apartment was very clean, comfortable and had all that we needed. The ACs worked very well. It was the perfect location for our ACL weekend...a very short walk to many great local restaurants and bars and easy to walk right to the fest. Would certainly stay here again next time we need a place in Austin. Thanks Adam!"
,,,,,,,,"Apartment is in an ideal location to see Austin.  Easy walk to downtown Austin.  Apartment was very clean and livable.  Outside sitting area is quiet and relaxing.  Potential renters should be aware there is no electric coffee maker (there is a French press), no microwave and only Apple TV.  Having never lived in an apartment, I was a little surprised at how clearly we could hear the tenants on the second floor walking around and dropping things."
,,,,,,,,"Adam's apartment was a great, little space for my group of 4 attending the Austin City Limits music festival. We did not spend much time in the apartment, but the king size and pullout beds were very comfortable, the rain shower was refreshing, and the outdoor space was a nice bonus. The apartment is also in a great location for the festival - a short walk down the hill to the Barton Springs area and all it has to offer.  Adam was also a great host.  He was flexible on check-in time, met us to show us the apartment, and checked in during our stay to make sure everything was ok.  One note: the apartment is part of a larger home, which is stunning by the way.  The upper floors have wood or stone floors, so you might occasionally hear someone walking around upstairs if you are in the bedroom.  Adam has a bowl of ear plugs if you happen to be sensitive to the noise, which did the trick for one member of our group."
,,,,,,,,Lovely place and great location in the heart of Austin!
,,,,,,,,Adam was very friendly and he always responded quickly. His home was great! Close to zilker park and downtown Austin. I would definitely stay there again! 
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place with some pros and cons.
Pros: 1- Adam, he is an exceptional host and will do everything he can to make your stay be great
2- The location is great, and you are close to everything Austin has to offer
3- The apartment is very nice
Cons: 1- If you get bothered by noise, check with Adam to see if the main house is rented during the period of your stay. Even though Adam will try to make sure anyone staying at the main house keeps the volume low, there is just so much he can do. And depending on whoever rented the main house you might be affected by their noise.
2- Austin has a fair amount of cockroaches when it is hot and humid out. That is not something specific to this house (actually this place is very good compared to everywhere else in town), but if you are going there in the summer/early fall and have an issue with the bugs you should not be looking for ground floor apartments.
3- The big garden in one of the pictures is NOT part of the property you are renting, it is only part of the main house."
,,,,,,,,"For starters, Adam is a great host - excellent communicator and friendly. The apartment itself was perfect! The photos don't do it justice, especially the blue cabinets. They are awesome in person! The apartment was very clean, the linens were fresh and the bed was comfortable.  Kudos to Adam on the architecture and decor.  We are definitely stealing some of his design elements! 

Great location in a quiet and friendly neighborhood minutes away from amazing restaurants, bars, and entertainment.  

We will be back for sure. Hopefully, next time with enough friends to rent 'the big house'. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam was great! Great experience, and the location was perfect. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was great! Very reachable and quickly answered any questions we had. We met him upon arrival and he had some great suggestions for things to do in the area. We used RideAustin at night and walked during the day. The neighborhood was great, safe and walking distance to some of the great sites like Barton Springs & South Congress Street. I would definitely recommend Adam's apartment and stay again if I find myself in Austin! Thank you!!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam has a fantastic home located downtown in a rare neighborhood setting.  Surrounded by friendly neighbors.   
The unit has great comfortable style and is fun easy and clean!
Take your bike and ride anywhere you need to be in ATX!"

,,,,,,,, Great place! 
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful property, central location, and Adam was an incredible host. In addition to his excellent recommendations of things to do, he was very accommodating. I highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host, this apartment was perfect for our trip to Austin. Clean and cozy, in a great neighborhood and part of the City. I couldn't have been happier with this apartment, I'll definitely consider staying here again when I am in town."
,,,,,,,,"Great staying at Adam's place! Location is perfect, the place is beautiful. Adam is very responsive "
,,,,,,,,"This was our first time in Austin, and we stayed at Adams listing. Which happens to be apart of a larger house but off to the side. We found the location to be really great, as mentioned in the listing, because we could easily catch a ride share to downtown/other areas of interest for very cheap. The place itself is very clean and nice. The air conditioning works very well which is a big plus because it was very hot and humid outside so it was refreshing to blast the AC when we arrived back from our daytime adventures (theres an AC in the bedroom and one out where the TV/couch/kitchen is). The bed is nice, big, and comfortable. The TV has an apple TV which is nice. There's also these ceiling fans that work nicely in conjunction with the AC to easily make a hot day a nice refreshing one inside. The only real issue/annoyance we had during our stay was a group of guys who had rented the main house making a ton of noise. Blasting their music and it was so easy to hear through the walls. From reading previous reviews i knew we might hear some footsteps but we weren't expecting to have to deal with a party house right above us. However, when i texted Adam he was very helpful and assured me that he only let the group stay because they promised to be respectful, etc. We were mostly out the house and unbothered anymore until a following Saturday which i guess was this groups last night. They went pretty hard that night until like 5am... But after that night they left and peace was restored. Bathroom is pretty small and not much places to hang your things, and theres a drawer under the sink that should be fixed. However, the shower and toilet works fine. The ceiling fan in the bedroom, when left on for awhile, also starts making some noises so we would generally just run the AC in the bedroom. Overall though, all things considered, this was a solid place with a solid location. Adam was very quick to respond and helpful whenever i needed help/had a question.

,,,,,,,,"Very good experience! The apartment is conveniently located, but still quiet. We were walking distance from several nice cocktail bars and restaurants, and a short drive from great downtown night life. Adam and Traci gave very clear directions for getting to and into the apartment and good recommendations for food and activities in the area.  "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is very conveniently located, as central as described. The furnishings are as spartanly artistic as pictured. However, there are a few things to note: 

The photographs and descriptions are strategically done to imply more than is actually there. The picture of the front of the house and the lawn seem to imply, to me, that we would have access to that lawn for activities such as frisbee or what have you. That is not the case. The apartment and the small patio are the only areas to which renters have access. The lawn is, understandably, for the exclusive use of the owners and their two children. 

When we arrived, despite directions from Adam, we were a little confused as to where to park. To compile that confusion was a rather large children's party occurring on the lawn that, as previously stated, I thought to be for shared use. 

Adam had not informed us about the party and we were unsure if we were in the right location and felt extremely uncomfortable pulling in to confirm. I at first assumed that it was a party being thrown by another tenant unbeknownst to the owners, thusly explaining why we weren't warned. This was not the case. It was a birthday party with two bounce houses for their daughter -- Adam had been in communication with us through the week and the party was not mentioned. This made the first few hours of the stay quite a bit less quiet then promised, and to be honest I was a little off-put by the lack of communication in regards to the party. 
~The water feature mentioned in the description was not functioning as it had been unplugged to accommodate the blow up slip and slide for the children. In the morning my parents had to pull retrieve the power cord and refill the water feature to properly enjoy it.

I understand that for most people, a children's party would not be a problem, nor for us had we been properly informed -- we could have altered our arrival time or made reservations elsewhere. (I am the only one in our four person party truly averse to interactions with small humans, and had I been informed of the party I would certainly have found alternate accommodations.)

When paying a certain premium for housing I expect them to be as described and to have open communication from the host. My partner and I use AirBnB for most of our travels and have never had this issue before. 

Adam did allow us to have a package shipped to the house which was very kind and, after reaching out to him, he did bring it to us. This was our first meeting with the host who is quite personable. 

Street is quiet. Entrance is private. Earplugs are provided lest the running of tiny feet should disturb. The bed is extremely comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything went smoothly during out stay, and the apartment was exactly as described. It's in a great location close to Zilker Park and many restaurants and bars. The apartment was clean and modern, the bed was comfortable and the shower was nice."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location in Austin
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect, and looks just as pictured. There's a blow dryer and iron available. There's also an oven/stove top/ toaster but no microwave. We didn't need it though it is in a prime location surrounded with lots of eatery. Adam was very nice,communicative, and responds fast. He'll try his best to accommodate if it's doable. "
,,,,,,,,What a quaint and great place. We came for a bachelors/brothers weekend before he got married and it was great to be back in ATX. Adam was a gracious house and the house could not have been more inviting. Highly recommended. 
,,,,,,,,Great location! Had a great stay!
,,,,,,,,"Adams place was amazingly cozy, clean, and close to pretty much everything. He was a great help for finding great places to go and eat and was easily reachable when needed. Home was also located in a very beautiful, safe, and quiet neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,Adam was awesome! He was very helpful and checked in on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. 
,,,,,,,,"Better than advertised, great quiet location, Adam made it all very easy. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam and Traci are awesome hosts. Their apartment was exactly as described and in a GREAT location in Austin.  I actually booked this location as part of my engagement plan (unknown to my gf).  After I proposed, we had in passing told Adam about the event .  We were TOTALLY surprised when they came down with flowers, chocolates, and champagne to make the trip even more memorable, SUPER SWEET of them!

Their place is truly a comfortable haven and would definitely recommend them to other guests! "
,,,,,,,,"Great host, awesome place with excellent location and quiet and safe neighborhood "
,,,,,,,,Such a cute studio in the heart of Austin. It was perfect for a quiet weekend away and some much-needed sunshine. We loved how close it was to Zilker Park and a short drive to South Congress Street. 
,,,,,,,,"Great experience at Adam's apartment, which is really a small in-law unit attached to the main house.  The location near Barton Springs and some great food is excellent.  The unit was clean and ready when we arrived, checking in and out were painless, street parking was plentiful and free."
,,,,,,,,"We had the pleasure of staying at this wonderful, modern, and enviromental friendly home.  The entire house was beautiful.  The Air BnB rental was located on the side of the house, with your own walkway and entrance.  The location of the rental was close to the best sites of Austin, accessible best with a car.  The rental was very spacious, equipped with everything you would need for your trip.  It was truly a home away from home, Austin Style!   "
,,,,,,,,"Adam is an amazing host and great communicator. He went out of his way to accomodate my special needs to make our stay a pleasant one. The apartment is just as pictured and located in a quiet, pleasant neighborhood that felt safe. Our evening activities were only minutes away downtown......just perfect! The bedroom has a very comfortable king size bed and optional guests may use a queen size hide-a-bed couch. There are wall mounted  air-conditioners in the bedroom and living room to adjust for individual comfort. Outside there's a small patio table w/umbrella and 4 chairs to enjoy flowering plants & morning coffee. If you wish to cook breakfast, there are pots/pans available and Whole Foods is a mile away."
,,,,,,,,"Adam was really good at communicating and his apartment was really clean and well set. The place is well suited for 3-4 people, kitchen has majority of appliances you would require and Adam will make sure you never run out of towels. The apartment is about 10 mins from downtown and the barton springs area (Zilker) so it's great place to enjoy  Austin without the neighbourhood getting too loud. "
,,,,,,,,This place was perfect. Great location. Adam was awesome! Can't say enough good things. Would love to come back and stay longer. 
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a fantastic host! He was super communicative before and during our stay. The space is clean, modern, and very cozy. Can't beat the location -- walkable to everything including downtown."
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic place to spend my time in Austin. The apartment is clean, cool, and just the right size. Having my own private patio was amazing. It's a short walk to the river, but also just a $5 uber to the center of downtown. I'd definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in a prime location.  We enjoyed our stay and Adam is a wonderful host!
,,,,,,,,"Cute, clean apartment. Very spacious. The neighborhood is quite and safe. The upstairs neighbors were loud, dragging chairs across floors at late hours of the night. Over all loved staying here. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, wonderful place with a welcoming host.  Recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at Adam's place and it is in a super location. Very central. Easy parking, private and comfortable. Recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay at Adam's place - it was the perfect space - modern, cosy and with all the amenities you look for. Adam's communication was great and was a really fuss-free stay. I loved being  within walking distance of so many great places to eat and check out.  "
,,,,,,,,Listing description was accurate and Adam was a very responsive and helpful host. 
,,,,,,,,Although I didn't get to meet Adam he was very easy to work with and communicated great! 
,,,,,,,,Our stay at Adams apartment was a great choice for our Austin adventure.  It was very clean and in a wonderful neighborhood-walking distance to lots of eateries and a short drive to other great areas.  Adam was easy to communicate with and always responded right away.
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying at Adam's apartment. It was nicer than we expected. Very simply and tastefully decorAted with plenty of towels and supplies. Adam goes out of his way to make sure you have everything you need. Also, it's in a fabulous neighborhood. Loved being there and meeting Adam and Traci. "
,,,,,,,,My wife and I decided to take our kids to Austin and stayed at Adam's place. Words cannot describe our satisfaction. Adam was a great host with clear communication and made us feel very welcome. The house is in an amazing location; close to everything but very quiet and peaceful at nights. We are already planning our next trip so we can stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was fantastic -- better than the photos and descriptions let on. The neighborhood was great and conveniently located -- Uber arrived in minutes, but I found it walkable as well. Adam was very responsive and helpful. I was in Austin for work, and would gladly select this place over a hotel again -- made the city experience that much better. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful experience at Adam's home.  The listing was extremely accurate and couldn't be in a  better location!  Great neighborhood within walking distance to wonderful restaurants, downtown and Zilker Park but still isolated on a quiet street.  

"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment close to city. About a $7 cab ride to bars and restaurants on 6th street. Room was clean and as advertised. 
,,,,,,,,great find. Adam was great at communicating immediately. Our stay was great. House is located in a quiet section just minutes from downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay!  The studio was clean & comfortable in a quiet, safe residential area.  No trouble getting Uber rides (about $6 to the convention center area).  Bring slippers - the cement floors are quite cold underfoot (but very cool-looking!).  Also, to any potential yoga practitioners:  there is plenty of space, but a thin travel mat won't cut it on these floors unless you're okay with bruises on your hip bones!   Good communication with host.  I would definitely come back on a future trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We loved Adam's place! It was very clean, comfortable, and 10 minutes from everywhere we went. It was so nice to be able to come home to such a haven, but also be close to everything. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time at Adam's place while we were in Austin. The location of the house was great and close to the downtown area, the kitchen was very well equipped and the house was very clean. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"It's a nice house to live in and Adam is nice though we don't have much communication. The apartment is nice equipped with bed, fast wifi, comfortable couch and the most important thing is it offers reasonable price. It was an awesome experience living here and Austin is a nice city. "
,,,,,,,,Adam's home was very well kept and very comfortable. The king bed has got to be one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. It was a spacious private room in a beautiful home. I would recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,"Great spot. This is a private apartment in a big, beautiful home on a corner lot. There are stone steps that lead you through landscaping to a private yard and entrance. Inside is very neat, clean, and modern. You can see Downtown Austin from the yard and is like a 3 minute drive to get there. Anything and everything you need is so close by. The neighborhood feels safe and the homes are beautiful. I was with my dog, so we walked around the neighborhood a few times.I definitely plan on returning to Austin and when I do I'll for sure look this place up. I recommend you do the same."
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host. He provided prompt and accurate information and was very easy to work with. This is a great spot, well located and it has an awesome feel to it. The neighborhood felt very safe, quite and close to all the fun Austin has to offer.
We would most definitely consider coming back in the near future. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazon my stay in fantastic location. Walking distance or short uber ride anywhere in ATX. House was perfect for two adults and two kids. It's very private too. Was clean, modern and had everything we needed. Bed was super comfy. Host was quick to get back on anything. We will  be back!"
,,,,,,,,Adam was extremely accommodating and the space was comfortable and clean.  The location is ideal for those that want access to town lake trails and other central Austin highlights.
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very responsive and communicative. His place was modern, clean, and comfortable and seems recently renovated. Some previous reviews mentioned the noise of a child running around upstairs - it's really not that bad or frequent, and Adam provided plenty of earplugs (both the normal kind that go inside the ear, and a different kind that covers your ear canal).

There were a few pictures/mirrors not hung (just leaned against the wall), a few missing lightbulbs, and the shower didn't function properly (there's two faucets, a wand and a waterfall, and only one of them worked).

However, all of these minor issues both are easily solvable, and are something I'm confident Adam will take care of quickly - we will definitely plan to stay here again the next time we're in town!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was just as described in the description and pictures. Great location, was able to get an Uber at 8am every morning within 5 minutes straight downtown. Quiet neighborhood, enjoyed running through the neighborhood and down to Town Lake in the mornings.

Definitely recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Very clean and comfortable. The bed slept very well. Neighborhood is nice and quiet and in a great location. Adam answered all of my pre-arrival questions and was very helpful. We had a minor problem and he came and resolved it the same afternoon, even leaving a bottle wine for trouble. We'll keep it bookmarked for our next trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Our stay here was perfect. The location couldn't be better and each morning we ran down to juice land headed over to Barton springs. It's on a quiet road in a cute neighborhood that's close to everything. The place was beautiful and clean. Bed is huge. Great stay here! Would definitely recommend to a friend. 
,,,,,,,,The property was as described and was in a quaint neighborhood with very interesting architecture. Questions to Adam beforehand were answered quickly and we truly enjoyed our stay there. 
,,,,,,,,Place was great! Second visit
,,,,,,,,"The location is amazing and the 1-bedroom space is great! Amazing fans and a/c to keep you cool.  Such a cute neighborhood to stay in and very central to a lot of good restaurants, bars and food trucks.  The unit is attached to a larger house which has quite a few young children (possibly a daycare?) inside. The noise from running and screaming children might wake you up around 7am. I am a heavy sleeper so it wasn't too much of a bother but my boyfriend didn't sleep well. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Clean, bright, stylish, comfortable. In a beautiful neighborhood on a hill overlooking downtown. It's about a 40 minutes walk, or a 10 minute Uber ride. The host, Adam, left a welcome beer for me in the fridge :) 

Two small things: If you plan on cooking, you'll need to stock up on basics. The kitchen has pots and pans and utensils, but no essentials like olive oil or even salt and pepper (that I could find). And note that the entrance is a little hard to find -- especially in the dark. The apartment is built into the family house, and the entrance is around the corner from the main entrance/driveway. "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful space, convenient to everything.  Great communication.  Highly recommend this host and place to anyone."
,,,,,,,,Awesome airbnb experience. Would absolutely stay here again. Clean and accommodating. 
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very welcoming when I arrived. I loved the place. It was very clean, modern and minimal. I barely turned on the air conditioning as the place was comfortable and seemed to be well insulated. They have a great little outdoor space to sit or work at with strong internet connection. It is right off of Lamar and close to most things. Easy to get into downtown, SoCo, and Zilker. You can drive, walk,  or ride your bike most places.  If you choose to take an Uber in town it is very quick and cheap. Tons of great restaurants nearby like Uchi and Shake Shack. Adam was very helpful in guiding me to Black Swan Yoga (donation based yoga studio), which you can walk to if need be. The neighborhood is family friendly with many people walking, riding bikes, kids playing, etc. in the evenings. I highly recommend this place and loved my stay here."
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay!
Quick walk to zilker park and awesome view
Defiantly would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood is very nice, Whole Foods is about a mile away - there's a great BBQ place (Terry Black's) and burger joint (Shake Shack) within walking distance. The apartment was clean. The cable service was awesome!! DVR, movie channels, sports networks! Perfect for someone who came into town to watch a football game and wanted to rewatch the recording. We'd stay here again next time we go to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Easy, clean, professional, no complaints. Listing is nice, really clean, comfy, great AC and walking distance or short uber to everything you need. The apt is a basement wing of the larger house with it's own entrance from a sliding glass door the outside. Good stay, would recommend.  15% state tax surcharge added when we arrived."
,,,,,,,,Adam has such a cool place and it's in an awesome neighborhood. The apartment looks just like the pictures and parking is easy. We walked to Barton Springs and to The ABGB (which I highly recommend). Adam made everything super easy and the place was spotless.
,,,,,,,,Adam was an excellent host! Very communicative and helpful with suggestions for our little weekend in Austin. The apartment is in a great location - we walked to dinner both nights. We would absolutely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"Very accommodating host, quite beautiful neighborhood, apartment was exactly as described."
,,,,,,,,"This place was great for weekend near downtown Austin!
Adam is excellent host.  No surprises.  Place was immaculate and just as pictured.  Cool looking ceiling fans!  The neighborhood really nice and safe.  Pedestrian Pfuger bridge a half mile away and Auditorium Shores Park offer the best 360 degree views of Town Lake and downtown in Austin.  Walkable 2 miles to 6th Street.  Bicycling also best way to get around (although you may want to walk bike up the next to last block on short hill up to apartment ;)"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, very clean and homey, friendly hosts"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host! He was very fast communicating via text/airbnb. His home was just the right size for 2 people. Sheets were clean and smelled like they had been washed the day we arrived. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed to cook meals and the fan/AC were life savers during the 104 degree weather! 

We only experienced 2 setbacks during our stay. First, the knob that controls the shower broke. Adam was quick to come over and fix it himself so no biggie. Second, our upstairs neighbor (a kid, I'm assuming) was very energetic during our stay. Unfortunately he/she was up pretty early so we were able to hear him/her running around pretty clearly. Now, Adam provides ear pluggers next to the bed, but I never enjoyed the feel of having anything in my ears so.. 

Other than that, great home and great location!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam is a great host and very quick to respond to any inquiries. The apartment was great, too. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was pure perfection. It was clean, bright, and beautifully decorated. I would highly recommend staying here. The location was close enough (never paid more than $9 for an uber anywhere we went) yet far enough from the bustle of the city. The neighbor hood was hip but also quiet. We walked to Barton Springs and to some cool restaurants. And the host was very accommodating and sent us a welcome text and told us not to hesitate if we needed anything. Defiantly will be back to stay again! "
,,,,,,,,"We were having car trouble and Adam was extremely comforting by being flexible with check in times. He provided a warm welcome and came out to meet us before we had a chance to call or walk up to the apartment. Adam's recommendations on where to eat and where to take our dogs were exactly what we had hoped to find in Austin. The apartment was very clean, just the right size, and extremely healthy. The neighborhood is tucked away in the perfect spot: close enough to everything Austin has to offer and secluded enough to get a safe and peaceful rest. Adam's apartment is the only place we'd would want to stay in Austin while visiting. "
,,,,,,,,"
Loved the location of Adam's place. Central to everything and easy to get in/out. Description of the place was exactly how Adam described. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was perfect for our stay in Austin.  The interior of the house is exactly as shown in the photos and the outdoor space is great for relaxing and taking in some fresh air.  His neighborhood is super quiet and walkable, and its proximity to restaurants, parks, and downtown is difficult to beat.  I should also mention that Adam was extremely hospitable, greeting us as we arrived, and he made himself available when we had questions.  We would definitely recommend his place to others.  "
,,,,,,,,Great place! Excellent location. Especially for July 4th - we could just walk to the park for fireworks versus dealing with traffic. Adam was always responsive and helpful. The place was very clean and had everything we needed. 
,,,,,,,,The apartment is in a great location pretty much close to everything and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. The place is very private and beautiful.
,,,,,,,,"Super Duper place. Incredible location in great neighborhood. Extra comfy bed with a very nice shower. Adam is a great host and has the place dialed from easy A/C, ceiling fans and a great little patio area. Private entrance with parking right at the bottom of the entry way. Simple, modern with attention to detail. I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,The home was very well done and clean. Loved the location and neighborhood. Adam was very Quick to respond to questions. Our only issue was the loudness of the stairs above us at night when the guests on the other side came in late night. Enjoyed our visit. 
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! Well kept, sunny yet cool apartment. Easy check-in and out process. Quiet neighborhood. 1/2 mile walk to great food trucks on Barton Springs Rd. Easy Uber ride to downtown. Fair amount of transmitted noise from upstairs part of the house - really only noticed on a day I was there in early evening (weather was horrible, otherwise I would have been out and about). Noise wasn't an issue at night when trying to go to sleep."
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay, Adam and his girlfriend was very friendly and helpful!"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in a great neighborhood. Adam was very great at communicating and responded quickly to any questions or requests.
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was so great! Close in proximity to all Austin things I love... Zilker, Barton Springs, Lamar and South Congress. Adam came and welcomed us upon arrival and provided us with all the information that we could need. He even let us in a couple hours early so that I could drop my dog off while we had appointments in North Austin. Adam was so nice and kept in constant communication throughout the weekend in relation to my dog. Unfortunately, my dog barked and yelped the first night we left for dinner. Adam texted to let me know- he even visited her and reassured my dog to make her stop barking. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! House was great- my favorite part was the shower- SOOOO incredibly comfortable!! "
,,,,,,,,"We couldn't have asked for a better location! Close to so many great restaurants and cool Austin spots. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly. The apartment was clean, comfortable and perfect for our 5 day stay (with kids!). Hosts were super responsive and helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here with two of my friends for a weekend getaway to Austin. Great, centrally located apartment. Super clean and comfortable. Highly recommend this place! "
,,,,,,,,We had a good time staying in Adam's home. The location was good- about 1 to 1.5 mile walk to downtown and easy driving distance to other nearby destinations. The home itself was very comfortable and had everything that we needed. The neighborhood seemed really safe. Our only complaint is that the upstairs neighbor was quite loud one evening.
,,,,,,,,"This was an awesome stay. Perfect for 2 people and a pet lol loved how modern and simple it was. Very clean, had everything we needed. My little merlin  (puppy) enjoyed playing outside. It was just the right amount of space. Enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and it felt very safe. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was just as expected with the apartment and the neighborhood is charming.  Too bad it rained so much.  But, it was a nice place to stay indoors too.  Adam made us feel at ease as soon as we arrived.  He made everything easy at check-out.  He even went out of his way to mail us the phone charges we left plugged into his wall outlet. What a nice person!"
,,,,,,,,"I'm from Austin and came here to stay while visiting my family. You know how it is... close... but not too close, right? Anyway, I'm particular about where I'll stay when I come to Austin and Adam's place is nothing short of fantastic. It's in a great historic old neighborhood surrounded by a cool mix of old and new Austin architecture. It is an easy cab or uber to anything you would want to do downtown or in the city. Adam was a great host and excellent about communicating. 

More importantly, Adam's nontoxic house is the kind of smart, environmentally friendly development that Austin needs. Growth in Austin is inevitable... but that doesn't mean it can't be done well (like Adam's place). I'd stay again for sure. "
,,,,,,,,"Simple yet stylish and well-equipped apartment--immaculately clean, a private entrance, tucked away but within easy reach of Zilker Park, downtown, South Congress. Strong AC units, great-sleeping king size bed, solid shower, and enough fridge/counter space, pots, and pans to comfortably cook a meal. The outdoor dining set is a nice extra touch. To top it off, Adam greeted my wife and me to Austin with ice-cold Shiner! Cleanest, comfiest Austin property I've rented so far."
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay with Adam.  The apartment is private and spacious and has everything you need.  The outdoor area was a nice area to relax and have coffee in the morning.  The apt. Is situated close to all the great things Austin has to offer and a cheap Uber ride away from East 6th.  We especially enjoyed Gibson's bar a recommendation from Adam!
"
,,,,,,,,"Even before I booked, Adam was very responsive and answered all my questions. Once we arrived, we were so pleased. We had our own private entrance and side staircase as well as a patio that we put to use a few times. We really enjoyed walking the neighborhood to both Uchi and Odd Duck (GO TO BOTH!) and Uber's were inexpensive to South Congress and the downtown area. I would recommend this apartment to anyone! "
,,,,,,,,Beautiful home in a gorgeous neighborhood. Would definitely stay in this lovely place again. Adam was extremely accommodating and there were no issues with our stay.
,,,,,,,,"Adam was incredibly responsive and check-in was a breeze. The apartment itself was clean and comfy--definitely one of my favorites in Austin! The location is great too, and we were walking distance from my favorite spots off Barton Springs.  I'd jump at the chance to book again. "
,,,,,,,,What a great experience...I cannot say enough about the house and the neighborhood.  All lovely and so convenient to everything!  I had a car but could have easily survived without one because bike rentals are just down the hill.  This is one house I am excited to visit again! 
,,,,,,,,"We did not get the meet Adam but I did have to call Adam and he was very responsive and the matter was taken care of right away. The apt location is excellent. It is 5 minutes walk to Uchi, the best sushi restaurant  in Austin! We also played mini-golf at Peter Pan which is less than 10 minutes walk. Wholefoods is about 5 minutes drive. We had a blast !"
,,,,,,,,"Adam made our stay very easy. We were able to check in early and he was there to show us around! The location is perfect, Zilker Park is walking distance...definitely check out the river pool and spend an afternoon on the river or relaxing in the park. Uber's downtown range from $5 - $10 and are all over the place. The bed and the pullout couch are very comfortable. A few things we noticed while staying was there wasn't a microwave, or coffee pot, and only pots and pans to cook with no Pam, salt and pepper etc., just keep that in mind. Cups, bowls and plates are all provided but only 4 each and  not dishwasher.  The walls are thin so if any banging is happening upstairs is can be heard.  Overall I had a great experience staying here and would recommend it to anyone.  Austin is a great city! I can't wait to visit again!!"
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I stayed here while visiting Austin and we couldn't be happier. The apt was perfect and Zilker is an awesome neighborhood. It's in walking distance of Zilker park (definitely check out) and several bars/restaurants. $5-10 uber ride to anywhere else you'd want to go. 

Adam is a super friendly (I bumped into him while walking around the neighborhood and chatted a few minutes) but also respectful of our space and let us do our thing. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"My sister, boyfriend, and I had a great stay in Adam's apartment! He was very easy to work with and responded quickly to inquiries prior to our arrival. Our check-in couldn't have been easier. We were bouncing around on a busy schedule, so didn't have the chance to meet Adam, which was fine, as we had no issues during our stay. Adam gave us all the necessary information we needed. Parking was very easy in this beautiful, quiet neighborhood. We were provided with towels and plenty of bedding. My sister slept on the pull-out couch (which she said was by far the most comfortable pull-out she's ever slept on--(memory foam?)) My bf and I stayed in the bedroom. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. I would recommend this AirBNB to anyone looking for a nice place to stay while in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Adam's place was stunning to stay at. The location is perfect for walking (or super cheap ubering) to a ton of great things in Austin while still being tucked away in a cozy quiet neighborhood. Adam was easy to communicate with and a cool guy in general. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host.  My wife, friends and I were there for SXSW and he allowed us to check out way later than most places would so that we could enjoy Austin a little more.  He was always available to answer questions when we needed it."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here during SXSW as a last minute work trip and was impressed with Adam's apartment and location, along with his responsiveness.  Located in the Zilker area, the neighborhood was very safe and also extremely convenient to getting downtown either via the walking bridge or a short Uber/car drive.  The apartment itself was brand new with beautiful design aesthetic and all of the necessities from silverware and plates to plush towels, linens, etc.  I would absolutely recommend this place!"
2048537,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Host made it super easy and convenient coming and going. House was exactly as pictured. Neighborhood was historic and charming, house was newer and modern."
,,,,,,,,Molly is amazing! Super organized and prompt with everything. She was also very sweet to leave us some Bundt Cakes for breakfast if you're getting in late! The house was SUPER comfy and that's just what we were looking for. We felt at home right away. Very clean and zero bugs. We'll be repeat renters!
,,,,,,,,This was the best Airbnb experience I've ever had.  Molly was above and beyond a wonderful host and the house was perfect.  There's nothing really else to say other than staying here was a complete joy.
,,,,,,,,My host couldn't have been nicer!  She checked in to make sure we had everything we needed.  She provided all kinds of information on the area.  She was so sweet and accomodating when we had a family emergency.  Can't thank her enough!
,,,,,,,,"Great house in a great location. Molly was a great host. Very clear instructions for the house. Great communication before, during and after our stay. I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Molly was great. She made sure our stay was fantastic and sent us a few awesome recommendations that made our trip great. The house is much better than the photos look! 
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect. Everything completely as advertised, clean, fully stocked and great layout."
,,,,,,,,"Convenient location,  beautiful and spacious home,  and accommodating host.   I would stay there again, without question. "
,,,,,,,,Well I'm a repeat guest (and with good reason) so I guess that speaks volumes.  It's a fantastic property in a great location and Molly is a very accommodating host. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,"I had the best weekend staying at Molly's beautiful home in Austin! I traveled with some girlfriends, and Molly made the experience as easy and fun as possible. She was incredibly accommodating with check-in and check-out times, and was very reachable on text and email. She went above and beyond, even offering to do any laundry for us if the washing machine wasn't working. The home was in great condition, and was walking distance to a few shops and cafes, and was a very cheap lyft or uber ride away from the nighttime hot spots like Rainey St. and 6th St. I'd absolutely recommend this home! "
,,,,,,,,"House is beautiful, spotless and in a great area. Molly was terrific, attentive and kind. Fridge was stocked with nice amenities and all a great time was had. "
,,,,,,,,"Molly was very responsive before, during, and after the rental. The space was thoughtfully prepared and ready for our guests arrival. VERY comprehensive list of things to do, places to see and dining options. Location is ideal - a quiet residential street with most of Austin a short walk or $5 +/- UBER ride away. "
,,,,,,,,"Molly's house in Austin was AMAZING! We stayed for a bachelorette weekend and had the best time. The house is large and fit all 8 of us very very comfortably. The kitchen and bathrooms have everything you could ever need and the fridge was even stocked with drinks when we got there! The house was also super clean and in a really great location. Molly is a wonderful host; very responsive and SO helpful. Logistics were very easy to sort out and everything we needed to know (plus a ton of recommendations) were there at the house for us. Thank you so much, Molly!!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is amazing! We came to Austin  with a group of 8 girls and this place had more than enough room for us. It was clean, spacious, and in the perfect location for us to explore the city with ease! We stayed in and made dinner one night and enjoyed the large kitchen and open floor plan. And the cherry on the top was the host, Molly. Molly was the best host we could have hoped for. She was extremely responsive, helped us with ideas of areas to explore, and was just all around wonderful! The whole experience was just perfect. We will absolutely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"My coworkers and I stayed at this beautiful home for 3 nights. We had to attend a conference at the convention center and were concerned that we weren't ""in the city"". This house is so close that everything is in walking distance! We loved that we were in walking distance to the best Whole Foods in the world and that many great bars and restaurants were nearby. If you have an active lifestyle, this place is for you! The house is also super close to the running trails by the lake and the boat launch if you want to paddle board or kayak.

The house was super clean and Molly left us some goodies to enjoy! The neighborhood is quiet if you want to get away from the East 6th street noise, but still close enough to enjoy it! We plan on coming back and staying here next year!
"
,,,,,,,,"Molly kept in frequent contact with me prior to the visit and upon arrival she has prepared a very extensive document on the amenities of the area, so even for the Austin unfamiliar a lot of guidance is offered up.   We never even met in person, but everything was covered.   

The location of the house is very nearly perfect for what I wanted.   We were able to walk to a lot of restaurants and interesting places to shop.   Whole Foods and Book People are a relatively easy walk away, and along the way there is plenty to capture your interest.   It manages to be quiet little street tucked in the heart of everything.   

The house itself was quite clean and comfortable, we spent plenty of time relaxing on the back patio and the living room between our adventures.   I had wanted a place with four distinct bedrooms and enough bathrooms that we would never feel like we were stepping over each other, and in that sense it was also more than adequate.   The master suite is ridiculously large, and is set up so a family could share the room and the walk in closet.    Since I had it to myself, I was swimming in space.

I would have no hesitation in recommending this place to anyone who needs a little bit of room for a small group."
,,,,,,,,"Molly was AMAZING. From the beginning when we were communicating via email and text to when she welcomed me in person at the house, she was great. 

She knew we were having a girls getaway (bachelorette weekend) and even prepared themed napkins for us that read 'Happy Bachelorette.' Plus, she had a white wine chilling in the fridge and a bottles of local fave Topo Chico mineral water with lemons and limes. There was also all the fixings for coffee, breakfast beverages (OJ, milk) and even micheladas. She also had a 'local guide' printed out with restaurants, stores, cafes, etc. that were organized by walking distance and then driving distance with her personal reviews. I felt completely welcome.

She also had soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, linens, etc. all prepared and ready-to-go. It was super clean and comfortable. Also, the personal care products were all really nice.

The house itself was JUST AMAZING. Beautifully maintained and super clean. Recessed lighting throughout. Even all the flatware and silverware were actually really high quality. It did not feel like a rental property and more like a real home. 

Overall, Molly went above and beyond and the house was beautiful."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it exceeded all expectations! The home and location was perfect for our weekend visit. Molly was a spectacular host, from providing recommendations for restaurants to try and things to do, to making her home extremely welcoming to us. The layout of this house was perfect for a group of 6--open kitchen, living room, and dining space for socializing, but a separate nook if someone wanted quiet. The house is walking distance to lots of great bars/restaurants, yet in a neighborhood that has character and a sense of safety. Molly also went above and beyond to extend my stay an extra night due to the weather canceling my flight out of Austin. Thank you, Molly!"
,,,,,,,,The house is definitely beautiful and in a great location. Molly was very friendly & helpful.
,,,,,,,,"Molly's house was amazing, with a great location.  Coordinating with Molly was very easy, and she was very accommodating.  We'd definitely recommend Molly's house for another stay in Austin.  Thanks, Molly!  "
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed a perfect stay! The house is beautiful, spotlessly clean, and stocked with anything one might forget. Molly, the owner, is super easy to get in touch with when we had questions and was very helpful. The beds are amazingly comfortable, if only I could have figured out a way to carry it back on the plane with me!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything about this house was excellent. Clean, comfortable, very convenient location. Thanks Molly!"
,,,,,,,,"Molly made us feel welcome from booking to preparation for the trip all the way to being there to check us in.  We appreciated the small touches in the home like the complimentary 6-packs!  The home itself was beautiful and spacious and on a street where, if I were planning to relocate to Austin, I would try to move to specifically to this awesome street in this very walkable neighborhood.  

For anyone unfamiliar with Austin, the location is ideal.  Within striking distance of downtown, S. Congress, the parks, and you can patch together a really nice jogging loop from the house around the trails by the river.

Great house, welcoming host, incredible location.   "
,,,,,,,,"Our party had extra guests and Molly was incredibly accommodating and a joy to work out logistics with prior to arriving in Austin. She was available all weekend for last-minute questions and even stocked the kitchen with some basic food items, which was such a sweet gesture. The house itself is a beautiful space. It's a short walk away from West 6th Street and a $6-8 Lyft ride from East 6th, but just tucked away enough to be away from the noise and busy thoroughfare. We were in love with the back patio space and all around happy with the house."
,,,,,,,,This was a wonderful home in a great location in Austin!    Molly was SO kind and thoughtful and so welcoming!    It was perfect for a weekend with friends.   Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"We had a girls reunion in Austin this past weekend and Molly was amazing!  The house was absolutely perfect for all of us and SUPER clean. It was fully stocked with everything we could imagine or possibly need. Hopefully I'll be able to make it down to Austin again and stay in her wonderful home.

"
,,,,,,,,Great location and great house!  Molly's home was a perfect fit for our group.  It was clean and had a nice open floor plan.  Molly was very hospitable and accommodating working around our arrival and departure times with ease.  She even went out of here way to return a phone charger that was left behind.  I'd definitely stay here again next time I'm in Austin and I'd encourage others to do so as well.
,,,,,,,,"We had my sister's bachelorette party in Austin and Molly was the most wonderful host. The house was absolutely perfect, fully stocked with everything we needed, and walking distance from most everything. I'm going to find a reason to come back to Austin & stay with Molly again :)"
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay! The house is incredibly nice and Molly made us feel more than welcome. Everything we needed (cooking materials, toiletries, etc) was taken care of, even with such a large group. She even gave us a complimentary bottle of wine. Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"My group really enjoyed staying at Molly's place. It is very spacious, with plenty of room for large groups. We especially enjoyed sitting on the lovely back patio while soaking up some great Austin weather. The location is also convenient and was a quick drive to places to we wanted to go. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others. Molly was also great about answering all of our questions and left us some wonderful breakfast treats!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 71 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13154457,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great place! Close to everything and Jennifer was an excellent host! 
,,,,,,,,"The Holly Street Charmer was perfect for my friends and me! The apartment is very spacious, very very clean, and super comfortable. Jennifer was super easy to coordinate with (passcode entry, so no key exchange!), and she was so sweet. We were between 3-6 over the weekend, so needed to use the air mattress which was excellent. The living area and kitchen are super spacious so we always had space for lounging and wine drinking. Having 2 toilets was a very real necessity, and the shower was a dream. Jennifer provided extra amenities like laundry, some snacks in the fridge, and a fully stocked kitchen, plus as many towels, extra pillows, and hangars as needed. The location is great - East Austin is the best! Suuuper easy walk to Rainey; E 6th would have been a hike though. Having the park across the street was great for street parking availability. The only caveat I'd provide is the apartment shares a hallway to the upstairs apartment, and the downstairs (this space) doesn't have a locking door off the hallway. We didn't mind at all, but some folks may be concerned. Apartment looks exactly like photos. All in all, 10/10 - would rent again! "
,,,,,,,,"This condo is a perfect place to stay while visiting Austin. Our family had Thanksgiving together in the spacious dining area and had no problem cooking the meal with this great kitchen. So much fun! This location is super close to Rainey Street, which had great restaurants and music. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"The downstairs apartment was cute, clean, and Jennifer was very friendly and helpful. Great price for a great space. "
,,,,,,,,"Great communication, lovely home, many little touches that made it a perfect stay! And the sheets were so nice!"
,,,,,,,,This was everything we wanted and more. Walking distance to Rainey street was ideal for my friends and I. This was a great location and Jennifer was very accommodating. We would stay here again for sure!
,,,,,,,,Couldn't have been happier with our stay. Very specious apartment with plenty of room for 5 plus people. Perfect for a weekend with friends in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"The house was very nice and stocked with anything that we could need. The house is a easy walk to Rainey street and not to far from 6th street which was great! We met Jennifer on the first night of our stay and she couldn't have been more hospitable. Our overall experience was awesome. I would definitely stay here again in the future, and recommend it to anyone looking to go out to Austin and have a comfortable pad to go home to. "
,,,,,,,,This was the perfect place to host my sister-in-laws bachelorette party! Jennifer was amazing host with great recommendations for the area! If you are planning to stay in Austin this is a great house and even better location. 
,,,,,,,,"We loved this house!! It was cute, clean and in a great location. Jennifer was a great host and we couldn't recommend this house more for anyone looking to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Jennifer was so accommodating when we asked to stay an extra night. There was nothing we missed and we were well provided for. Thank you so much!
,,,,,,,,Jennifer was very responsive and generous in her hospitality. She provided drinks and a handful of snacks that hit the spot after a night out. The place was spacious and clean. We were very comfortable and look forward to staying here again next time.
5820783,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Great location in a safe neighborhood. It was perfect for our two night stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"The trailer was a great place to stay, with lots of amenities.  The neighborhood is very nice and safe.  Overall it felt like a little home away from home.  If I'm ever passing through Austin again I would definitely try to stay here."
,,,,,,,,"Adam's airstream was a great place from which to explore Austin. Everything was as described and the neighbourhood felt really safe. We walked into downtown Austin in about 25 minutes or used Ride Austin taxi app to get around. There are a couple of food shops and good restaurants within walking distance. Inside, the aircon kept us cool and the place was really clean and comfortable. The bed was a really good size for being in an airstream, too. Adam gave us some great tips and was on hand through our stay if we needed anything. Lovely, unique place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"We loved this cozy, quiet stylish little home, near everything. It was so hot and uncomfortable in Austin during our July stay, but we knew we would be returning home to a perfectly cool bedroom every night, so we slept easily and that is really the paramount consideration when traveling. A perfect little home, I will look forward to returning!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Adam's airstream was perfect for us! It was just how he described it and a nice cool escape from the Austin summer. We enjoyed walking around the neighbourhood and up to Barton Springs. We had planned on renting bikes but between walking and using Fare for rides, we didn't need to. Adam was also very welcoming and friendly. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host and the airstream was a lot of fun! The only problem was the A/C in the living area did not work, but we barely spent time there, so it did not bug us much. He gave us beach towels and restaurant recommendations. The neighborhood is spot on in the best part of town! $6/$7 cab to downtown, super easy. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam's little jewel was the perfect find...Tucked into a quaint Austin neighborhood, this funky old, refurbished Airstream was a delightful home away from home. Adam is a superb host and wealth of information. He was agreeable to us having our little chihuahua tag along as well. The place was spotless and stocked with all the amenities we needed as well as fast wifi, efficient air conditioning, cozy bedding, and a tv so we didn't miss Shark Week! If you thrive on unique experiences and good people,  then I cannot recommend Adam and his Airstream enough! "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in the Airstream was just wonderful. The location is great near South Congress and South First, and a short ride share to downtown/6th Street area. The airstream was comfortable and clean, and surprisingly spacious! Adam was very friendly and available if needed for questions. The best part was that our dog could come along with us. We'd definitely stay here again, thanks Adam!"
,,,,,,,,The Airstream was definitely an awesome way to begin my time in Austin. It was very comfortable and surprisingly spacious. The amenities matched and even exceeded most traditional hotels that I had been to. The neighborhood was also really cool as well and very quiet which was nice. I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend this particular place to everyone.
,,,,,,,,"Great. Hot, but great."
,,,,,,,,"adam is a great host. nothing is too much trouble! great advice on where to go, and what an amazing airstream, loved it!!! would definitely recommend"
,,,,,,,,"The host was very welcoming, it was in a pleasant and convenient spot, as described, and the airstream was comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was as described/listed. Adam was quick to answer my questions. Safe neighborhood, close to everything. I recommend this spot."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was really nice. The whole process was easy and we were comfortable during our stay. It was easy to get to places to eat and hang out. Parking was good except for late in the evening after dinner when the neighborhood had a lot of guests everywhere (but it was the weekend). Overall a nice place to stay and we would definitely stay there again and would recommend it. It was a nice, quiet place to rest and was worth the cost. Thanks to Adam and his family for sharing their little piece of Austin heaven."
,,,,,,,,We had a great time in Austin. The good old Airstream fullfilled our expectations.... Everything we wanted to see was in walking distance... We got good recommondations for diner... Very safe and quite neighbourhood.... Next time again... keep South Austin weird...
,,,,,,,,"Awesome experience! Fun, clean and in a great neighborhood. Would recommend to anyone.."
,,,,,,,,"This is an AWESOME spot, and Adam is a super nice and considerate host.  Really safe and fun neighborhood, right by the Drafthouse.  You couldn't ask for a better spot in South Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The listing was exactly as described if not better. It was in a perfect location and we felt incredibly safe. The airstream itself was really well appointed and we were pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was. Adam and Traci were superb hosts and we would love to stay with them again. Would highly recommend you visit this unique Austin gem.
,,,,,,,,My wife and I fell in love with this camper! Location was insanely good!  
,,,,,,,,"Adam was tremendously welcoming and a great host.  The trailer is charming, in great shape and well outfitted.  The location is tremendous with quick access to some of the best spots in Austin.  
Will definitely come back!"
,,,,,,,,This cute trailer is clean and comfortable!
,,,,,,,,"Sorry I didn't get to meet you Adam, had a great time and the neighborhood was lovely!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Friendly host. Unfortunately the air stream was not up to expectation. We could not lock the door, the septic smell was very unpleasant, the shower did not have enough hot water for a quick shower, the heating and cooling where not adequate."
,,,,,,,,What an amazing place! Couldn't ask for a better location! So much to do all around with a unique experience in an airstream. Adam was the perfect host! 
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin! The airstream is well maintained and in a tucked away residential neighborhood.  The location provides easy access to the trails along the Colorado River, downtown Austin, and S Congress. Thanks, Adam!"
,,,,,,,,"My wife, three year old son, and I are now in the tail end of a six month road trip starting in Maine.  We've stayed in lots of different places along the way, and this was certainly the most unique.  Neither of us had ever been in an Airstream before.  An Airstream is like a boat; every inch is engineered to make it feel spacious and comfortable despite its small size.  The bed was very comfortable and cozy.  The extra sleeping area was good enough.  We were here for four weeks total and 2 weeks later, we already miss Austin.  The Airstream is at the foot of the driveway of a large home on a very private cul-de-sac.  It's both private and central to everything.  We've been traveling with just one car, and that was not a problem here.  It's a great neighborhood for bicycle riding and walking.   The hosts and neighborhood were incredibly friendly and hospitable.  This is an extremely family friendly place.  We were very happy here."
,,,,,,,,"Truly fantastic experience and a great way to see Austin. The trailer was clean, cute and equipped with everything we needed. Thank you! "
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I stayed in the airstream for a weekend trip to Austin. Loved the airstream. I had always wanted to stay in one and it didn't disappoint. 
The bed was very comfortable, the shower and bathroom worked perfectly. 
The location is south of downtown, a $5 uber ride or a few miles drive. We had a great time going to Uchi, Shake Shack, Peter Pan's Mini Golf, and Green Mesquite BBQ.
I highly recommend this spot for a weekend trip!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host, and his Airstream was awesome. Can't think of a more unique Austin experience than this."
,,,,,,,," We felt very welcomed by Adam! We loved the unique experience of staying in the Airstream. It was really tidy, clean and very comfortable.   We even got a bottle of wine!

The location was really central and we were able to walk to the core of the city, or  take a short cab ride. 

We really enjoyed staying here ! Thanks Adam! Will definitely stay at your place next time we are in town!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great long weekend in Austin and loved the airstream. The location was perfect. We enjoyed the neighborhood and the nearby bike trails. Thank you for your hospitality!
,,,,,,,,"Great experience. Adam couldn't have been easier to work with and answered all questions promptly. If I come back to Austin, I hope to be staying here again. "
,,,,,,,,"So cool to get to stay in an Airstream and a big bonus to be in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Adam was a great host â€” and quickly resolved the questions and issues we had. I have always wanted to experience an Airstream, and one of my takeaways is to expect things to be different and quirky as you are staying in a trailer and not a home or hotel. I was impressed with how much was efficiently packed into a relatively small space â€” queen bed, toilet and good-size shower, a fireplace, a seating area with a single bench for sleeping, stocked kitchen, TV, closet and storage. Previous reviews that had concerns about lighting and shades have been addressed and wasn't an issue for us. We did have an issue with the heating one night when the temps dipped, but Adam was prompt and professional in his response."
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Minutes from bars, restaurants and shops. The Airstream was clean with plenty of room for 2. Quiet peaceful location on a cul de sac. Though Adam was not on the property while we were there, he was prompt at answering all of our questions via text. 
Only suggestions we have is better lighting. One or two more lamps would do the trick. We felt safe, but were unable to lock the door. 
We would recommend this property and would stay again.
Thanks Adam    "
,,,,,,,,"This stay was about 2.5 stars. First the positives -- great in-town location, easy to map and find, easy check-in. Fast, reliable internet. Quiet neighborhood. Easy communication. The trailer was clean. Microwave works, freezer/fridge work.

There were some drawbacks that would give me pause about staying here again. There is very little privacy, as the deck pictured is right outside the front of the main house, which is all glass on front x 2 levels. Awkward looking in at the happenings of the main house at all hours, and having the renters of that house look back out at you, as the trailer/deck are basically in their front yard. The Airstream itself is a bit worn, updated TV/AV system but most everything else is original and tired. Many light fixtures did not work properly, so it was fairly dark. The main AC unit is right over the bed, so to cool the front end of the trailer effectively, the bedroom has to be uncomfortably cooled with a hurricane of air that blows over the bed area. Cooking would be difficult, there are 2 token pots but minimal cooking supplies, no condiments, gas range (no oven) that I was not able to get to light."
,,,,,,,,This place is wonderfully located and extremely comfortable. Our host was super nice and quick to respond to our needs/concerns. Cool place. Great stay. 
,,,,,,,,"Adam was so helpful, and accommodating !   "
,,,,,,,,"GREAT LOCATION, AIRY CARAVAN. LOVELY HOSTS.
The caravan is fully kitted out, airy and spacious in an excellent location-nessled in the corner of the garden in a safe leafy neighborhood, two blocks from local bars/restaurants and a bus stop that will take you into the heart of downtown in ten to fifteen minutes. Its an easy walk to both zilker park and soco. Adam and family were great hosts, easy going, friendly and helpful-leaving me alone in total privacy but were on hand whenever i needed anything. I would highly recommend staying here. "
,,,,,,,,The Airstream was extremely convenient to downtown and felt like a safe neighborhood. We'd definitely stay here again if it's avaliable!
,,,,,,,,This airstream was so cool. The patio wrapping around was great for coffee in the morning.
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood, great hosts, and a lovely, charming little spot. Just minutes away from Zilker Park and Barton Springs. I very much recommend this rental. Adam went out of his way on multiple occasions to answer my questions and make sure I was comfortable. Extremely responsive and generous! This is a tidy and well-appointed operation. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice safe, quiet neighborhood - very easy to get in and out of downtown. Adam was a great host."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in a great location with everything that you need and more. It was so nice to be able to sit out on the balcony eating breakfast in the morning. Adam was friendly and knowledgeable. 
,,,,,,,,Adam left an information packet that explained the ins and outs of the Airstream. This was very helpful. 
,,,,,,,,"Host was very friendly and welcoming. Description was accurate, although the bed for the third person was a thin and narrow pad used as the couch, but it was fine. Shower was great, bed was comfortable. Neighborhood was great. Most of our destinations were blocks away. Easy, shady parking was available right outside the airstream the whole time. Loved hanging outside on the deck with friends after our kid was asleep. "
,,,,,,,,Great weekend stay in Austin. Away from the hustle and bustle of downtown but still close enough to walk places. Friendly yet unobtrusive host family who gave some great recommendations. 
,,,,,,,,The host is very welcoming and I had a wonderful stay in the airstream. It was very spatious and well decorated. 
,,,,,,,,"Terrific neighborhood, awesome deck that's great for hanging out with guests, and plenty of room for us and our baby in this fun Airstream! The kitchen is somehow almost the size of ours at home, too. And the AC is as good as promised-- we stayed in 100-degree weather and were very comfortable. Perfect place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We had an incredible stay in the Hillmont Airstream! My wife and I could not have asked for anything more. It was so close to everything we wanted to do but so incredibly quiet and peaceful. Adam was sub an incredible host, chatting with us when we first arrived about where to go eat and some activities to do. We had our bikes with us and it made the stay really easy, I would highly suggest renting bikes while in town and staying here. We are absolutely going to be back and will certainly be looking to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent stay in Adam's property.

We couldn't have asked for a better location, or a better Austin experience. 

We will definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Adam was an excellent host. The place is nice and the location is outstanding. 
,,,,,,,,"Great, unique place to stay in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood. Walking distance to Uchi! We appreciated the stylish decor, cleanliness and functionality of the airstream. The bed (and the bedding) was comfortable, and the ""front room"" was nice to hang out in. Thanks for providing such a great option in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Our stay in Adam's airstream was one of the most unique and pleasant of our entire cross-country road trip. We had plenty of room for two adults and a small dog in the clean and modern trailer. Adam provided excellent recommendations for dog friendly activities and amazing food. Would highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"How fun to stay in an Airstream.  We were so comfortable and this was the perfect location for the three of us and our dog. The airstream includes Fast Internet and Great Air conditioning and even a hair dryer.  Adam and Tracy were so welcoming and kind.  

The location is Perfect.  We walked to Zilker park with our dog for some off leash time for him and out walk took us past a great juice bar and a strip of great restaurants and Food Trucks. We swam at Barton Springs which is within walking distance or just a few minutes by car.  We also visited SOCO area, whole foods, and Alamo Draft House which are all very close by. 

Staying in an airstream paired with this incredible location makes Adams place a must for Austin visitors and I plan to return."
,,,,,,,,"Loved our stay with Adam, airtstream was clean and cozy and in a great location that was very very quiet. "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first air bnb experience, and it was better than I could ace hoped. The Airstream was perfect for me and my small dog (a Puggle). Fast wifi, excellent air conditioning and the hosts Adam and Tracy were friendly and helpful while respecting my privacy. I loved everything about this experience ... Goodbye hotels!"
,,,,,,,,"What better way to visit Austin than to stay in a classic Airstream, in a great neighborhood, in the center of everything that defines Austin.   One night I went for a run around Town Lake, had dinner at a cool restaurant on S. Lamar and I didn't even need to drive.   

The Airstream is fully equipped, very comfortable and has a great little deck outside to relax.  I couldn't believe there was even an iron and board which I needed to use because I had business meetings. 

Adam was very responsive to my questions.  Thanks Adam!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect! Great location, gracious host. We felt very at home in the trailer and would love to visit again. "
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay and the neighborhood was very quiet and safe.
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a good host.  He sent me  a text msg letting me know that the Airstream was clean and ready early.  He did a good job of explaining where to find the key and where to park in the text msg.  When we arrived he came by to see if there was anything that we wanted to know about his neighborhood.  If we needed anything all we needed to do was text Adam and it magically appeared.

The neighborhood is located very convenient to restaurants, bars, and grocery stores.  Trader Joe is a 20 minute walk.  Whole Foods is 25 minutes away.  There is easy access to miles and miles of beautiful nature walks by the river.  Boat and bike rental is very convenient.

The Airstream was a very interesting experience.  We were there for two nights.  It was a lot of fun and a learning experience.  The neighborhood is quiet and there is a nice place to sit and listen to the birds.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was adequate with sufficient hot water.

Despite comments by others about the lack of adequate wi-fi we found that there was a very strong signal.  It appeared that a new router had been added in the Airstream."
,,,,,,,,The airstream was a cozy space for 2 people with the amenities of home. Nice deck with table and chairs to enjoy the outdoors. The owner was very attentive to our needs and helpful in giving us suggestions for restaurants and activities when asked. 
,,,,,,,,Adam was phenomenal. He is truly dedicated to your positive experience. He was very accessible for everything I needed and provided quick answers and assistance for all my questions and issues. I will be back in Austin and will be staying in one of Adam's properties again.   
,,,,,,,,"Adam and his family were very welcoming and accommodating. I arrived  late at night but due to the fact that the airstream is its own entity, I could easily enter without disturbing anyone. The neighborhood was very safe kind of tucked in an area that did not have much traffic. It was also very close to everywhere I wanted to go. When I wasn't driving, it was very easy to walk or Uber around. It's a beautiful area and the Airstream is in great condition - I highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I came to Austin for a little getaway and had a wonderful time! The airstream was located in an amazing neighborhood on Adam's property next to his equally amazing house. The trailer was pretty much what we expected, and it had all the basic amenities you would need. The wifi didn't work in the trailer or even too well outside, which we didn't care about, but just be aware if this is something you are depending on. 
The location was great for going downtown or even hitting up one of the many great nearby spots. We met Adam and his wife Traci and they were welcoming and offered some great suggestions on where to go. 
We would recommend staying here for a fun and unique Austin experience!"
,,,,,,,,The stay was great. Adam's place was perfect for wondering the city. My wife and I walked to downtown and then to Rainey street and took an uber back. The next day we walked over to Congress street and Ziller park. The place is on the middle off all of it.  The neighborhood hood is neat because it has a lot of new modern construction along with the old neighborhood. It reminds me of LAs Silverlake and Venice neighborhoods. Overall a nice stay if you have ever slept in a camper before. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, safe neighborhood, nice host. Had a great time :)"
,,,,,,,,"Adam and Traci have a charming Airstream, in an amazing location in Barton Springs. The space is just right for a couple, we never felt cramped. There is a lot of storage, and places to tuck everything out of the way. The wifi doesn't work in the airstream but we weren't in Austin to sit inside and be online!  "
,,,,,,,,The airstream was exactly what we hoped it would be.  It was clean and well appointed.  It is situated in a great neighborhood.  We had a blast in Austin.  Adam left a comprehensive welcome packet.  This was an easy place to stay.  Adam even mailed us some items that we left behind!  Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Adam was great! We were getting into Austin really late, but he still met us when we got to the location. He gave us a tour of the Airstream, showed us how everything worked, and let us know that he would be available to recommend things if we'd like. Super friendly, awesome neighborhood and location. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam and his family were beyond warm and welcoming. They gave amazing advice on great local spots for food, coffee, getting out, and where to take the dog. The trailer was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Really, just an amazing trip. I Highly recommend this set up to anyone looking for a place right by where all the action is in Austin!"
3104453,4.5,9,10,9,10,10,9,"The loft was so charming and more spacious than we expected. It is right on 6th street, so you couldn't ask for a better location. The locks to the building and door are keypads which made check in and check out super easy. "
,,,,,,,,"This flat is managed by wonderfully dedicated team who really go the extra mile in making a visitor feel welcomed and comfortable. I was here on business for a fortnight and the flat was located in the heart of downtown austin. It works really well if you want to go out, or eat. Options for uber eats galore. 
When I arrived there was peculiar smell in the flat but the team helped remove it quite earnestly. 
All in all, a lovely stay. "
,,,,,,,,Great accommodation to have a good party at 6th Street. 
,,,,,,,,The listing and the agent described the property very accurately but the noise was more that we imagined. While there is plenty of noise from 6th Street (to be expected) the noise between the floors was not. If you are going for location above all else...this is the place! The agency is very professional and did everything that was expected including a jar of ear plugs in the bathroom.
,,,,,,,,"Checkin was super easy and the place itself was exactly like advertised. Great location, convenient to both night spots and the convention center. 

Communication was great and all of my questions were addressed quickly and fully. I would definitely recommend Top Trip Rentals to anyone"
,,,,,,,,"The host was fantastic, great communication and very clear."
,,,,,,,,"The apt was just off of 6th street, great location downtown. Parking was a bit more expensive than I had hoped, but I guess that is what you pay downtown Austin. The place was very clean and actually probably a little larger than I was expecting."
,,,,,,,,"Our great experience started long before we arrived. The Top Trip Rentals team was so quick to respond and offer assistance. We were in a bit of an unusual situation, and they worked with us every step of the way. I was impressed with how they went above and beyond to be excellent hosts. The space was great and had many welcoming touches. There were plenty of linens, and we found everything to be really comfy. The noise from 6th street can get a little loud (which we knew to expect), but the space is surprisingly quiet and even has a sound effects machine for lighter sleepers. Accessing everything was super simple, and our host was easy to communicate with before and during our stay. This was a great choice for us! We would definitely be back with Top Trip Rentals next time."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at this loft over Labor Day weekend. When I first arrived, I found the parking garage with no problems, but wasn't sure the best place to park with the easiest access to the loft. I ended up parking on a random level, then entering through the lobby to the loft then went out to the parking garage from there so I could orient myself and moved my car to that level so it was close to the door. 
Upon arrival everything was spotlessly clean. There was water and some snacks stocked for us and also a beautiful box of cupcakes and a birthday card. Those cupcakes were the cherry on top and it was such a thoughtful gesture!
The location was perfect and I was able to walk to everything I needed. It was about a ten minute walk down to Whole Foods, about 5 minutes over to Congress Ave where I watched the bats and of course, 6th street was right below us. We had the best time sitting on the balcony and just watching everyone on the streets below. I thought noise might be an issue with the close proximity, but even during the chaos of Labor Day weekend and the big UT/Notre Dame game, we had 0 issues with any noise.
I'm already looking forward to another trip down to Austin and will definitely be back to stay at this place. 
"
,,,,,,,,Perfect location and great place! 10/10 would pass out here again.
,,,,,,,,Perfect location.  Host communicates well.  Would recommend
,,,,,,,,There was a welcome packet which informed us about the essentials and the places to go. The listing was accurate and we had a great time.
,,,,,,,,"2 bedroom, 2 floor loft on 6th Street...What more could you ask for...I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this home with my two kids. We had plenty of space and the location is convenient. I will definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,"Our host was easy to work with and made our stay very comfortable. The keyless feature was extremely convenient and let us enter the property at our leisure without having to worry about who had a key. The unit was very clean, well decorated, and comfortable. We had everything we needed and were also steps from great bars and restaurants in downtown Austin. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, everyone at Top Trip was super helpful! Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"O apartamento e localizaÃ§Ã£o sÃ£o incrÃ­veis e a disponibilidade e ajuda dos administradores, louvÃ¡vel. Super recomendado!"
,,,,,,,,It was a great place to stay in Austin! Good location to every place around downtown. I'll definitely stay again when I visit Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time using AirBNB, and i could not have hoped for a better trip.  Residence is exactly as shown in the pictures, and the location is perfect for those wanting to experience 6th St and/or Rainey St.  TopTrip was extremely professional, and responded quickly to every question i had.  I believe the construction that i read about in other reviews has been completed, as I had no problem with the building.  (although this could have been the fact that it was a holiday weekend)  Either way, i completely recommend this location."
,,,,,,,,Amazing loft apartment!  Right on 6th street as advertised.  Place was very well decorated and perfect for the people that we had there.  Everyone was helpful and made the stay better.  Very much so would rent from Top Trip again.  
,,,,,,,,"Top Trip Rentals, especially Chereen made out Austin trip memorable, fun, and relaxing! Chereen was incredibly responsive, gave great advise of sights and food, and made herself and her team readily available for anything we needed. Would definitely recommend working with this renter and hope to come back in the future! We even got a sweet welcome to Austin goodie bag, if that's not great service I don't know what is!"
,,,,,,,,We have an amazing time in Austin. We were in town for business but the accommodations and location made it feel more of a vacation. Very quick to respond and very helpful. Would stay here on every Austin visit!
,,,,,,,,"Hosts were very helpful and responsive.  We stayed for the Formula 1 Grand Prix weekend and it was a great location for us.  Quick to get down to the freeway that went out to the track, but right in the middle of the action after dark.  It was noisy, also Halloween so expected, but the hosts provided earplugs which were appreciated.  You are right on 6th street so bars, clubs, and restaurants are right out the front door.  
A perfect base for the GP weekend.  "
,,,,,,,,"Super-convenient, great location.  Small, but comfortably housed 4.  Sparsely furnished, but let's be honest, you're not on 6th Street in ATX to sit on a couch and watch TV."
,,,,,,,,Great experience! Host and security staff were attentive and helpful throughout our weekend stay at this Littlefield Quarters property! Location is right at the end of the 6th St strip. The noise level was not at all an issue for myself and friends during ACL weekend. We will all definitely book Top Trips again in the future!
,,,,,,,,The place was very comfortable for four.  The apt was very clean with plenty of towels.  The location was perfect.  You can alway get a can with can with the driskell on the across the street. We had no problem accessing and multiple keys worked great.   We stayed during ACL and noise was a non issue.  would highly recommend top trip.  The only negative was we couldn't figure out how to work the cable TV.
,,,,,,,,"The spot was accurate - right on 6th street, which was the best part of the location.  There were a good number of beds (2 twins, 1 queen) upstairs, a pullout downstairs, and a couch that worked well as a bed too.  The place was clean, towels were provided.  The host did a good job of communication and were responsive."
,,,,,,,,"Cozy and very well located! If you have troubles with noise during the night may have some issues on the weekends, but the apt is great!"
,,,,,,,,"The host handled the booking process very expeditiously and was immediately available when we arrived.

The location is great! However, that comes with the territory of hearing 6th Street nightlife until quite late. Top Trip Rentals warned us of this and had earplugs prepared. 

There were a few downsides: 
- the pull-out sofa bed was thin and uncomfortable to the point where we couldn't sleep on it
- the tension shower rod fell down repeatedly, and depending on time of day, we weren't able to use the shower because the condensation in the bathroom wouldn't allow us to prop it back up."
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I stayed at this rental by Top Trip Rentals for 3 nights.  The team was very friendly and helpful with communication leading up to stay.  To accommodate 5 guests, we had one king bed, 2 twin beds, pull out couch and an air mattress.  The loft was very comfortable with plenty of space.  It had everything we needed with regards to linens and dishes.

The neighborhood is vibrant being centrally located for those who want to explore Downtown Austin.  If you would like to go out at night in Austin, the place is just a few minutes from the Dirty Six and 10-15 mins from both West 6th and Rainey Street.

I would recommend staying at this establishment, particularly for those who want to enjoy Austin nightlife."
,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed staying at the Littlefield Quarters. It is very convenient to downtown. The apartment was nice, clean, and could have easily slept 4 in the beds with one extra on the couch. It was loud at night and had no doors or dividers between the rooms, but they were very up front about both of these facts. Normally, I would stay further from 6th, but if looking to stay right on it, this is as good as any other spot."
,,,,,,,,"The host was very helpful and accommodating, especially when Airbnb screwed up. The neighborhood was as expected except that the convenience store mentioned was closed down. Everything else was as expected.   "
15673504,3.5,7,7,9,9,9,7,"This really was a lovely, modern, clean and well appointed place. I would reccomend it to anyone especially for a family. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic house. We were 4 colleagues who wanted to be comfortable during a work trip - kitchen, living room to relax, etc, and it fit the bill completely. Very comfortable, spotlessly clean, and easy to get to and from Whole Foods, dinner/bars, and our work obligations. Great WiFi for getting work done when we were home. We would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"First off, i'd like to say that I've stayed in Air BnB's around the world and never had any problems until this listing. The pictures showed a pool, which is why we originally booked it, to find out when we arrived that the pool is in the neighbors backyard.  It was clear misrepresentation. Overall it was a very poor experience and I would recommend everyone to not stay at this property, not worth it to deal with the host. "
4111528,4.5,10,10,9,10,10,9,Great place to stay. In walking distance of 6th street and downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place, pretty much 15 mins from where you want to go. "
,,,,,,,,Location location location...a perfect location for exploring downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Can't beat the location for exploring downtown. Was very pleased with the space, would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Adam's condo is in a great location. It was very clean and looked just like the pictures. Kenny the agent was available for any questions. The room was very dark at night which I loved. The only thing I didn't like was that you can hear the people walking past outside but it wasn't that bad.
,,,,,,,,"Great location, and a nice, comfy apartment. Adam was super responsive with questions as well!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great property if you want to be in the heart of Downtown Austin. It's extremely walkable and overall a good value. The neighbors in this complex are very nice folks. The general neighborhood is extremely lively, so if that's what you're looking for, especially if you're into nightlife, this is a killer spot. I personally thought there was a little too much noise from local bars and crowds to be 100% optimal for me, but it wasn't anything too bad.

Bed is extremely comfortable, internet service is fantastic. Shower could use some improvements. Kitchen is well stocked with large refrigerator. You can sleep 4 or more in an emergency as the property comes with an air mattress, but I'd say this space is optimized for two guests max.

Couches are very comfortable. Would personally prefer to see the TV moved from the bedroom to the living room so guests could take more advantage of it.

Pool is small but very nice. Great spot to relax for a bit although you're not going to be doing a ton of swimming. Property is basically pool adjacent, so it's very convenient.

Parking that comes with the property is outstanding, can't recommend enough. Secured parking is very expensive in Austin, and the space will save you a ton of money.

Overall, recommended space, with a few improvements this is an easy five star."
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in a great location. The host answers questions promptly and is very helpful. Super comfy bed-which is always a plus. Would definitely  stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Can't beat the location!! Amazing restaurants and bars in every direction. Apartment was clean and Adam was super accommodating and even let us drop off our luggage several hours before check in. Apartment is right on the street so it can get a little loud at night. It didn't bother us at all but if you are looking for a quiet night in you might not want to stay so close to the action. If you are looking for a fun, conveniently located place, this is it!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great AirBnB to stay at! The location is great, walking distance to the bars on 6th street and Rainey street as well as different shops/restaurants along the way and even up to the Capitol. Apartment is a nice amount of space for the 2 of us and the tempurpedic mattress was so comfortable we were sad to go back to our own mattress! We had no issues and would definitely stay again! "
,,,,,,,,The location was perfect. Walking distance from 6th street and Rainey. Apartment was very clean and queen size bed was very comfortable. The air mattress didn't hold air so one person had to sleep on the couch. Sleeps two adults comfortably. The ceiling was leaking in the bathroom due to air conditioning and the shower didn't drain very well. 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is exactly as described. Kenny the manager was extremely helpful and attentive. The location is absolutely perfect if you are driving, walking or taking the bus. I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay in this lovely downtown apartment. Location was great (a very short walk to 6th Street) and the apartment was very well furnished (with a very comfy bed!). The host was always accessible and helpful when we called. Would thoroughly recommend! 
,,,,,,,,Everything went smooth with regards to arrival and the stay. The location was perfect for us as we could walk to all of the locations downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"Everything was exactly as pictured. The location is pretty central to the downtown area, very convenient. Host was quick to respond with any questions. "
,,,,,,,,Host was very responsive and unit is clean and very nice inside.
,,,,,,,,"Location was extremely convenient, Kenny answered my texts super fast we had a great time !"
,,,,,,,,Very good experience. Thanks. 
,,,,,,,,"This condo was perfect for our weekend in Austin! Communication was quick, efficient, and our questions were answered promptly and in detail. The condo is well-laid out and has all the amenities we needed to have a comfortable weekend. Huge points for the mattress in the bedroom- it was so comfortable!

Best part of the condo was the location- we were so close to 6th street and the Congress bridge. Rental car not necessary if you are staying here. Even though we were so close, the noise level was minimal, and with the AC on we all slept through the night without any interruptions. "
,,,,,,,,This place was perfect-great location. I highly recommend it. Thanks! 
,,,,,,,,"Central location to everything with parking.  Check in instructions were easy, I just had to call to find out which parking spot to park in (H3). Pictures accurately depict the apartment. Memory foam mattress, clean towels, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were provided.     Cable tv, wifi and full kitchen.  Comfy couch and recliner.  The rugs could have used a good vacuuming and surfaces wiped down a bit.  The shower dial was a bit tricky to get to right temp and drained slowly.  Overall nice place to stay.  Never met/dealt with the host directly only corresponded with property manager Kenneth. "
,,,,,,,,The communication with Adam regarding the condominium was awesome. He event went as far to accommodate me for a time earlier than the check in. I would be happy to do business with Adam and stay at this lovely place again!
,,,,,,,,"The condo was awesome! It was exactly what we needed, and the location was perfect. Host was easy to contact and very helpful. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Amazing location. Super clean pad and just a great experience all around!
,,,,,,,,"Great location and place as described.  We had trouble getting into gate to park upon arrival (key FOB battery died), but manager was responsive and delivered a new FOB immediately.  Location was awesome...quick walk to Rainey and 6th, and we actually walked to campus for ND/UT game (about 15 min).  Great experience...highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"It was easy to arrive, smooth, great location and a very comfortable home. "
,,,,,,,,"Incredibly convenient location right near a ton of restaurants and things to do downtown, and 2 blocks from sixth street!  Also having the parking space was incredible because you still need to drive to most daytime activities in Austin.  Bed, couch, and comforters were super comfortable!!  Also, amenities were perfect as high quality shampoo, conditioner and other toiletries were available, so good for out of town visitors traveling via airplane.  Didn't have to communicate with owner since instructions to pick up key were clear, which was also very convenient."
,,,,,,,,"We had a fantastic stay at this apartment. It is super convenient for walking to Sixth Street, and it is easily navigable to get to South Congress, as well. It's the perfect crash spot if you're going to Austin, no matter if you are young or old. The neighbors were quiet and there was practically no late-night noise. Super comfy bed, too!"
,,,,,,,,The place was phenomenal. Right near sixth street and not too far from Rainy Street. Condo itself was just like in the pictures! Contained a bunch of space and was very comfortable. Having the condo literally right next to the pool (probably 10 feet away) was prime location of the complex. Would definitely come back here!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic little apartment in a fantastic location. Easy walking distance to Rainey street, state Capitol building, sixth street etc. clean apartment with all amenities. Would definitely stay here again when next in Austin. Also great to have a carpark and a comfy bed. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is just as advertised. Adam was very understanding with us bringing one more person.  Location was amazing,  walking distance from dirty 6 and rainey. Most importantly he was very responsive with all our questions when we arrived."
,,,,,,,,This place was absolutely amazing! Great location (even next to the pool) literally a 2 minute walk to 6th street.
,,,,,,,,Great location!  You could walk everywhere or use Fasten (Austin version of uber) to get around. A Starbucks and cab stand was across the street at the Marriott.  The pool was refreshing during the afternoon heat and the condo was comfortable and clean the little time we spent inside! 
,,,,,,,,The location was perfect and gave easy access to everything in downtown Austin. The recliners in the living room were so cozy we stayed in the apartment way longer than we had planned. I would stay here again without hesitation. 
,,,,,,,,Perfect place for a visit to Austin. Location is central to everything the city has to offer. Check in was a breeze and communication was quick and informative. We will be back to Austin and we will be staying here again.
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location for the Convention Center and very clean. It really had everything we needed. The pool , washer and dryer and also parking spot were a great bonus. Quick answers came for the few questions we had, at least  at first. We stayed 5 days and were very pleased except for the unfortunate partying of a large group of 20-30 people in the pool on our last few nights. They very loudly partied until after 5am. We had early meetings so this was quite inconvenient. While we can't fault the owner for this, Adam didn't reply to last 2 messages we sent with concern and questions and this lowered our rating a bit. "
,,,,,,,,Booked Adams place for an out of town business guest. I let him know and everything was taken care of great from then on without me being involved. 
,,,,,,,,"Great space in downtown Austin! The apartment was exactly as described - and it was perfect for a weekend away with my friend. Awesome location near so many shops, bars, and restaurants-we walked mostly everywhere. (The bus from the airport dropped us right 1 block away from the apartment-so easy!) Having the washer & dryer was very convenient and the space was roomy and clean. The host was so helpful and I appreciated the quick responses and pleasant communication. This was my second trip to Austin and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay.

I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone traveling to Austin, especially if you are looking to explore the many food/bar options and nightlife downtown!"
,,,,,,,,"Kenny (the property manager) was very responsive and helpful.  The place was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located to the convention center where I was attending a conference.  It was also nice to have access to laundry as this was only one stop on my journey.  The only real issue I had was that the noise outside from people coming in to the other condos late at night was a bit disruptive.  However, I would definitely recommend to my friends and would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Adam was great! The location was perfect! Loved having the pool!
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in Austin downtown! Really conveniently located and well appointed with appliances for your stay. For longer term stays the apartment would be most comfortable for couples since the 2nd air-mattress bed takes up a fair bit of space in the living room and affords limited privacy etc. All-in-all definitely a good option when you're booking an Austin downtown stay.
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay. The location was outstanding and the description and pictures accurate. Clean and comfortable stay.
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at Adam's place! Excellent location! The place was very clean with plenty of space. Adam was excellent with communicating.
,,,,,,,,The host was very reliable and easy to get in contact with! He always responded promptly to all questions! I would go back to Austin anytime and stay there again! 
,,,,,,,,Great place and host!
,,,,,,,,"Great place in a great part of downtown Austin. The place was exactly as described in the listing, very clean also. The benefit of having a secure parking spot was also great. Would recommend to anyone who is wanting to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect size place for 3 people. Comfy to stay in. Plenty of sheets and towels and great location!
,,,,,,,,"Great communication and place, everything as described. "
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was great, it was in a perfect spot for exploring downtown Austin! I highly recommend his place."
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment! It was the perfect place to stay for a few days in Austin. If you're planning to go out and enjoy the city's social scene, the location can't be beat. Minutes from tons of bars and restaurants on 4th Street and 6th Street, plus an easy walk down to South Congress for plenty more eating/drinking/shopping.The apartment itself was clean, well-maintained, safe, and quite comfortable (not to mention it's awesome having parking included). This was my first time visiting Austin (and I was traveling solo) and I couldn't have picked a better place to stay. I'd recommend this apartment in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,Nice place. Great location. Adam was very helpful.
,,,,,,,,"Directions were super-clear, everything was straightforward. Neighborhood is right in the middle of everything, blocks to 6th street and the best donuts in the world (Voodoo Donuts). "
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had an excellent stay here! Very easy to contact the host who answered all our questions right away. Perfect location that was walkable to 6th Street and Rainey St where all the action was, and a very short drive to South Congress. The apartment was clean, spacious and comfortable. We appreciated having a washer /dryer in the apt.  The parking which was included saved us a lot of hassel. We did not have a chance to use the pool but it looked clean and nice. Would definitely recommend the apartment to others!"
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was just as promised. Great apartment in a fantastic location. Plenty of delicious reataurants and upscale shops are only a short walk away. And if you get hot walking around, there's a nice pool to cool off in. Would highly recommend Adam's place if you want a comfortable apartment right in the middle of it all."
,,,,,,,,Nice and clean place. Adam was very accommodating.
,,,,,,,,"Our visit was great. The location couldn't have been better. It was really nice to have a pool and a nice apartment. We felt right at home. Adam was very responsive, even at 2 am. 

Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a perfect location for the conference I was attending! Being 2 blocks away from the Convention Center but also 2 blocks away from the night life if you want to walk or $7 to get to The Continental!  The condo was immaculate and if you had a car, parking is good to have."
,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed staying here. The location was perfect, and the apartment was clean and had everything that I needed for my stay."
,,,,,,,,Great location and nice apartment. Easy dealing with the owner and worked out great for our stay.
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was phenomenal. Very homely, and I can't imagine a better location."
,,,,,,,,This apt was great! Clean and perfect location. My wife and I were able to walk to all locations as it is centrally located. Very responsive too!
,,,,,,,,Amazing location and great space. The condo has everything you need for a stay in Austin
,,,,,,,,Convenient condo located close to all the main spots. Very clean. Fully equipped with towels and sheets for all the guests. The instructions to enter the premises were easy and well explained. The host was very communicative and easy to reach if we needed anything. I would definitely return to this condo knowing the comfort of the home and accessibility of the host!
,,,,,,,,"Adam was helpful and inviting. I reccomend this place for future guests. This apartment is downtown and close to great dining, coffee shops and shopping, it is also right up the street from 6th street. This is a great way to experiance downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very responsive whenever I needed information. The apartment was clean with all the basic necessities for a few days in Austin. The bed was very comfortable as was the nice leather couch. The kitchen came equipped with newer appliances and basic meal prep equipment. The location of the apartment was great. We parked the car in the gated covered parking area and left it there the entire time. We walked less than 5 min to 6th St, 30 min to S. Congress and 10 min to the river path. I would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Very nice clean place. Perfect location and easy to get in and out of building. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was just as pictured, clean and comfortable.  This location is very close to great running trails, restaurants, and night life.  Despite being in the city, it was pretty quiet.  I had an issue getting in the lock box for the key, but they quickly took care of the issue and got me in.  I would definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,Lovely apartment in perfect location.
,,,,,,,,"The listing description was completely accurate. The location was central and right next to every major thing you want to see in Austin. The space was clean, accessible, modern and hip. It had everytbing we needed, including parking (which is hard to find in Austin). It's in walking distance to the capital and to major nightlife areas. All the rooms were clean and towels we're provided. Overall a great experience! "
,,,,,,,,"Adam was very helpful by answering any questions I had promptly. His apartment is very conveniently located next to sixth street, the bat bridge and public transportation. We saved a lot of money getting to his place from the airport by taking the metro. I had everything I needed to make my girls' trip a wonderful experience! Thank you so much Adam!"
,,,,,,,,Great location central to everything downtown Austin. Kenny the onsite manager was awesome and super helpful. Adams place is comfortable too. 
,,,,,,,,Our stay in Austin was great! The location was absolutely perfect. Close to everything. The condo was very nice and clean! Response time was great as well! I would highly recommend this place! 
,,,,,,,,Location was excellent and the apartment was clean and comfortable. I would stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,We loved staying at this condo! The location was great and the place was very nice and clean. We would highly recommend this condo for anyone vacationing in Austin for work or pleasure. 
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was fantastic.  It was clean, comfortable, quiet, spacious, and the location was unbeatable.  It's within a two block radius of the best live music you'll find downtown (5th and 6th street).  It's maybe a 5-10 minute walk from Rainey Street and Town Lake.  The parking was heavily gated and secure.  Adam was on-the-spot for any questions I might have had.  I could not recommend it more highly.  "
,,,,,,,,Nice apartment. Solid location if your looking to visit 6th street.
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was super responsive to my questions and accommodating to our travel schedule (we were able to check in early). The location was fantastic and super convenient: close to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and designated car2go parking spots. The only minor thing was that the wifi was spotty. Overall a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,Location is fantastic.  The apartment was very nice.  Would highly recommend. A+++++
,,,,,,,,"The location was excellent.  We were able to walk most everywhere.
We felt safe. The furnishings were top notch. "
,,,,,,,,Adam's apartment was in a great location and delivered on everything we needed. House was easy to access and the host was very helpful with accommodating our needs. Would stay again next trip to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Adam's property was great. It was beautiful and well-maintained, and was in a great location. Everything it promised to be. Even better, the host was very responsive when I had something I needed assistance with. I'd happily stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Convenient apartment to enjoy Austin nightlife, both 6th street and rainy street are walking distance. "
,,,,,,,,"A terrific location for travelers who need or want to be near the Convention Center, 6th Street, etc. The host is attentive, and responsive to requests. The apartment is in reasonably good condition -- very clean, though a bit worn. The internet was not working when I was there, but the host did offer a discount as a partial remedy. Overall, this was a good stay in a nice place."
,,,,,,,,Great location - will look for this property again next trip to austin. 
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I had the perfect stay at Adam's place. Prior to booking, we had a tough time deciding on where in Austin to stay.  This ended up being the perfect decision. It was enough space for the two of us, close to downtown (especially 6th street), safe (gated), great parking, and quick drive to all of the locations we wanted to visit in Austin. Adam's place was clean, comfortable, and a great addition to our Austin vacation.  We would definitely recommend this place to others!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great condo, and great customer service from Adam!  The place was very clean, comfortable, and cozy.  I will definitely stay here again next time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Great stay! Great location! Great communication! Very responsive to emails and extremely easy to access. It was very convenient to have our own parking spot and you can't beat being only two blocks from all the action on 6th Street. I would recommend this place to my friends if they visited Austin.
,,,,,,,,"The condo was definitely in a great location...not to far off from 6th St.
The amenities, furniture, and decor were suitable.
However, the downside we experienced was:
the key wasn't in the lockbox and specific instructions were not given as to how to access the reserved parking space (ie. clicker inside the condo) and how to exit the condo (ie. clicker is needed to open automatic gate.) That type of information before hand would have alleviated much pain and anxiety."
,,,,,,,,"This is a great spot to use as a jumping off point for exploring downtown Austin. It's close to Congress and 6th St., but tucked away in a quieter part of downtown. Good thing, because the walls are definitely thin. Otherwise the place is comfortable, clean, and nice!"
,,,,,,,,"Our host was friendly and welcoming, the location was fantastic, and the condo itself was just as advertised. We were very comfortable there and enjoyed the ease of access and the gated parking. We would definitely stay there again! A great place to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Great place! Worked perfectly. Easy to communicate with. 
,,,,,,,,Awesome spot in Austin! Really close to the heart of the DTA. Will book again in the future.
,,,,,,,,Our host was very attentive and answered all questions. Unit was just as described. Safe DT location. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place.  Absolutely perfect location for anyone attending an event at the convention center (a block away), or just wanting to be close to the good restaurants and night life on 6th St.  The place was nicely setup.  Even though it's on the first floor next to the street, the bedroom is on the interior of the complex, away from the street.

The owner was extremely responsive and very accommodating, even letting me check out a little later than would be necessary.  The entire process was effortless, except for my own mess up.  I actually left a shirt in the closet, and the owner let me know immediately and even offered to ship it back to me (which wasn't necessary)."
,,,,,,,,The apartment is very spacious for 3 people and had everything we needed for our stay. The location could not be any more convenient. Kenny was very accommodating about letting us drop our things off early. 
,,,,,,,,Great place.  Adam was very easy to get a hold of and accommodating.   I would suggest a TV in the living room to improve the stay.
,,,,,,,,"My experience in the apartment and dealing these guys was great. It's located in a perfect spot, right between the busiest areas of downtown Austin and near excellent restaurants. I got in late the night of my arrival, and arranging for the key was no problem. If you have a car, don't worry about it. The parking is secure.  The apartment looked like it was never used, because it was so clean. I totally recommend this place. "
,,,,,,,,The place was nice.  The shower was tricky to get used to and did not drain very well but it seemed that he was having some drainage issues since the dishwasher and disposal were not working either.  We loved the location.  We saw a show at ACL and it was a perfect walk to the bars and the venue.  Thank you.
,,,,,,,,"This was my second visit to Austin, so I knew exactly where I wanted to stay. Adam's apartment is right in the centre of downtown Austin, within easy walking distance of the many bars and good restaurants, as well as the Convention Centre. 

Despite the central location, noise was not an issue. Everything else was exactly as described and when I visit Austin again, I wouldn't hesitate to book Adam's apartment. 

Communication was easy and efficient too. An easy recommendation!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect stay! Easy to check in, thanks for letting us come early to drop off luggage! As easy to check out, more than enough clean bedding, perfect place to stay while downtown! Literally less than five minutes to sixth street. Kenny the manager is super responsive when texted. Very professional. Thanks for a wonderful stay! "
,,,,,,,,"I was in town for a business trip and this place was perfect. Quiet, clean, comfortable, and the location couldn't be better. I didn't get a chance to use the pool, but it looked nice. This dude Kenny is the property manager, so there's pretty much no fuss with checking in or out. I highly recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"The place was impeccably clean, comfy and very centrally located. I didn't meet the owner himself, but when I had logistical questions the property manager was readily available by phone/text. I'd stay here again."
,,,,,,,,My husband and I had a wonderful time. The condo is in the perfect location! I would recommend this to anyone looking to stay in Austin. The place is super modern and clean and looks just like the photos! 
,,,,,,,,We were graciously allowed to check in early. Very nice because we wanted to explore a bit a lugging around suitcases is practical! The home was cleaned and tidy and the location was just 2 short blocks from the convention center and we could walk to so many different areas.
,,,,,,,,"Very easy in and out, great hotel alternative and clean/comfortable!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location and apartment.
Fast wifi and handy parking right in the action downtown but still really quiet in the apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was perfect. I could walk out the front door and be on Congress or 6th Street in a few steps. And when done for the day, I could relax in the cool and comfortable living room, eat in kitchen or bedroom. It was a much better option than the neighboring chain hotels. "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location!  Can walk to all the restaurants and bars you want.  The pool is a little small and can get busy on the weekends, but we we're around much for it to be an issue.  Seemed like everyone was having fun too.  We'd both stay at this place again.  It's well maintained, clean, and again -- great location!  Also, helps to have a parking spot."
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood, right downtown within walking distance to a lot of different restaurants. A/C was cool in 100+ degree August weather, fast wi-fi. 

Great place. I'd like to stay here again next time."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location in downtown Austin - just a block from the convention center and two quick blocks to 6th street. There were grocery stores and plenty of restaurants within walking distance as well. As close as it was to all these things, we were not at all disturbed by noise at night.

The condo was clean, comfortable and well stocked with plenty of freshly laundered towels and sheets as well as toiletry items and kitchen needs. The host checked in on us to make sure everything was okay and I appreciated that! The photos represented the property exactly and the reclining sectional couch was so comfortable I wanted to sleep there!

The complex itself was very secure with key fob entry to the courtyard area which accesses the individual units and the parking remote and assigned space were extremely handy as we didn't have to pay for street parking outside the complex.

Another great thing about renting this condo is that it was less than the price of the hotel rooms that I usually get and I got privacy, a great space, a full kitchen and parking included. You can't beat that!"
,,,,,,,,"It was nice staying here in Austin. There were some issues with the wifi, however, the host attempted to resolve the problem and compensated me appropriately. While the listings mentioned two beds the first night I stayed at the Condo the airbed (which is what I assume to be the listing's second bed)  would not hold any air. I had to sleep on the couch which was not ideal for someone who is tall. I was informed that the airbed was replaced, but alas, I'm not sure one should list an airbed as a bed if there is a chance of it not performing said function. "
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay and great location. 
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment in a great location! It was well kept and had all the essentials. The property manager Kenny was accommodating and super easy to work with. Getting in and out of the spot both on foot and by car was super easy. Overall positive, hands off experience that was exactly as advertised. Thanks guys."
,,,,,,,,"This is THE place to stay in Austin! It's in the perfect location-walking distance to everything. My wife and I were so pleased! The place itself had everything we needed (toiletries, hairdryer, full kitchen) and the pool and parking space were an added bonus. We will definitely be staying here the next time we're fortunate enough to get down to Texas. It surpassed our expectations! "
,,,,,,,,"Nondescript building very central in Downtown.  Unit is on ground floor, but not noisy.  Unit looks as advertised.  Good value, I thought.

This is a standard managed rental. There was no contact with Adam.  Kenny is the property manager, and he met my needs promptly by text message.

There was a problem with hot water during my stay.  Kenny tried unsuccessfully to fix it and offered a reasonable partial refund on checkout.

"
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was great! There's a tiny pool right outside of his apartment. The place was clean when we arrived, and fully furnished. Make your stay here at Adam's place! Great price, excellent location, and a private parking spot as well!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience at Adam's place. Our host was friendly and *extremely* responsive (got back to us  via text within just a few minutes if we had questions). The apartment was clean, comfortable, and very centrally located. We LOVED the pool! Would definitely recommend staying here.

I slept on the couch and found it very comfortable. We were provided with a nice set of extra linens and pillows."
,,,,,,,,"Great experience. 
Perfect location - just a block or two from all the places you wanna be in Austin. The condo was in great condition, trendy furnishing and extremely clean. It felt like home. The prices are much better than a regular hotel or other accommodation. The host was in a constant communication with us and ensured we had everything we needed. Will definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Easy access and a great location.  We took public transportation from the airport and it stops a block away.
The unit is actually nicer than the pictures and there are all the essentials you would ever need. The kitchen was well stocked including coffee, filters and creamer.  The furnishing were very nice and great for a couple.  
The condo is well located for restaurants, night life and retail. It can occasionally be noisy because of the activity on weekends-typical of urban central locations."
,,,,,,,,"Easy to locate! Very clear directions on how to access gate codes, garages, etc. The interior was spotless and welcoming. There was even various breakfast items (i.e. orange juice, biscuits, eggs, salsa) in the fridge for fresh and ready for us to use. The area is perfect for anyone wanting a central location to take a weekend getaway. "
,,,,,,,,Great bang for the buck considering the location. Would book again. 
,,,,,,,,I would highly recommend the apartment. It's very clean and in a great central location within walking distance of most anything you want to do. Adam and the property manager were very quick to respond to any questions.
,,,,,,,,"Great place, as described in the listing.  Very close to downtown activities!  Adam was very helpful and responsive when we had questions.  Would definitely stay here again if I ever came back to Austin. :)"
,,,,,,,,"We just loved staying at this tastefully furnished, very comfortable apartment. Unbelievably convenient to everything downtown. Just steps away from the convention center, great coffee, top restaurants and clubs, even a yoga studio across the street. Refreshing pool. Amazing to have a parking space right at the building. Location makes it easy to walk or drive everywhere. Adam is an excellent host and communicator. We look forward to staying here again!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed in this condo for a friend's 30th birthday weekend and couldn't have been happier with the accommodations or the location.  We were able to walk virtually everywhere (and did) and if we didn't feel like walking the most we paid for an Uber ride was approximately $6 (except to the airport).  The host contacted us before we arrived and made sure we had enough blankets and pillows for everyone since we had 4.  The condo was very clean and had everything we needed for the weekend.  The property manager, Kenny, provided his phone number and he made himself available at any point if we had questions.  The air conditioning stopped working at one point and he had it fixed by the time we were back from our tubing trip.  We used the pool in the property and everyone in the building was very nice.  We highly recommend staying there and we would absolutely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent host, excellent communication, very cozy apartment, 2 blocks from 6th street, we were minutes from all everything. Next to the pool, apartment was as advertised.  I would highly recommend the location."
,,,,,,,,"Are host was very friendly.  He made sure to contact us before we arrived to the condo, and made sure we had everything we needed.and that we could access the condo since the condo is gated.  The condo was very clean and in a great location.  We would definitely rent out this condo again. "
,,,,,,,,"The entire check-in process was seamless. The condo was clean and perfect for three people. There was an air mattress that was comfortable and easy to set-up. The pool was small but a great place to cool off after a day in the Austin heat. The location was awesome, with everything in walking distance or near public transportation. We would definitely stay here next time we are in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The property manager, David, is very nice and responsive. The condo is clean and tidy, in an excellent location, and I felt safe walking down the street at all hours. The pool is good for cooling down in HOT Austin weather, but don't count on it for a swimming exercise."
,,,,,,,,Nothing but good things to say. Apartment was super clean and great location. Wouldn't hesitate to rent again. 
,,,,,,,,"We were very impressed with our condo during our stay in Austin. We were allowed to check in early and leave our stuff in the condo while Dave cleaned from the previous guests. Everything was very clean and well decorated. We had four guests, and the air bed worked perfectly. When we couldn't find the wash clothes, Dave came by and dropped some off. I highly recommend this condo and if I return to Austin I would love to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"The Location for this downtown condo is incredible.  You are close to the Convention Center, Area Restaurants in the heart of Austin, Texas.  Thanks for providing recommendations on the local restaurant options.  The condo was solid from top to bottom.  The Kitchen had brand new appliances and the unit was extremely spacious.  Thanks for accommodating our last minute booking.  You made it extremely easy on our first AirBnB Experience.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great communication, very nice condo in an excellent location.  A very smooth experience all around.  Highly recommend for a great stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Overall, we had a great experience!! The location was perfect, especially to enjoy the downtown area. Restaurants and bars were within walking distance. The condo was impeccable! Very clean and comfy! Adam was very responsive to our texts and questions! Would definitely work with again! "
,,,,,,,,"Nice part of town. Easily accessible to good bars and restaurants. Well maintained establishment. Definitely recommend. Went smoothly, no complaints"
,,,,,,,,Great location! Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby to enjoy.  Apartment was clean and bed comfortable.
,,,,,,,,"Adam's apartment was in the perfect location, allowing us to explore much of Austin on foot. Room was as described, and getting in upon check-in was very easy."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at the condo. Everything was as advertised; very happy with how everything went. Great location, fully endorse if you want to be right in the middle of everything in downtown Austin. Our contact, David, was very helpful. We left a couple of shirts there and he has promised to return them to us. 10/10 would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"The location of this condo is perfect for walking to 2nd Street District, 6th St District, Rainey St etc. We walked up to the capital as well. It is a short taxi ride to the music venues on S Congress. The condo was nicely decorated, spacious and very clean.

"
,,,,,,,,"You can't beat the location.  We walked to dinner, and spent the evening sampling some of the bars. Great place.  Would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"The location was primo for downtown activities with great restaurants, bars and coffee shops literally on the next block. The property manager was super responsive when we accidentally locked our keys in the condo too. I would stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a really enjoyable stay at Adam's apartment. The place was in a great shape, the furniture was nice, everything was clean. The neighborhood was a perfect home base to explore the city. Some of the best coffee shops are just around the corner and a few really great bars just a couple of blocks away.

Our only problem was that the internet was out, and even though the property manager gave my number to the TWC representative, they didn't manage to fix it during our stay (we were only there for a weekend, though).  "
,,,,,,,," The location is amazing, in the middle of downtown. Apartment was very clean. We found kitchen to be lacking basic kitchenware and supplies. Property manager wasn't the most responsive.  
"
,,,,,,,,"Fabulous location and comfortable accommodations. Host was very responsive when an internet issue cropped up and helped immediately! Even though this is on a busy street, the apartment was incredibly quiet; no evening noise and plenty of sunlight in the morning to help get the day going. Overall a great experience!
"
,,,,,,,,"The host was very gracious and helpful. The location is very convenient and near hotels, busy 6th street, and not far at all from the historical capitol building. "
,,,,,,,,"Great unit for 1-4 people in the ideal location in downtown Austin. Close to 6th street, Rainey St, and campus. Would definitely stay there again my next time in town. Adam was a good host and the padlock system allowed for easy access to the apartment without having to meet up in person. Apartment is nice, clean, and well furnished. "
,,,,,,,,This listing is 100% accurate. The space couldn't have been better for my stay. The location was awesome and the apartment was comfortable and clean. Will definitely book again the next time I am in Austin and need to be downtown.  
,,,,,,,,"Actually the apt manager is named Dave (Adam hired him).  He was super friendly and was trying his best to help us.  The electricity was out for most of the day (but we weren't using the apt till later (URL HIDDEN) we didn't mind too much).  Dave wasn't able to clean as usually, so he went and bought new sheets, pillow cases, blankets and towels....he did the best he could.  Thanks Dave!

 He let us check in early to leave our luggage so we could explore Austin a bit more before we left.  Electricity came back on when we got back later which was really nice because we needed the heat.  Austin was freezing during the time we were there.  Location was awesome!  We were able to walk to the bars/lounges, restaurants and cafes!  "
,,,,,,,,"Dave is the property manager and helped us out during our stay. We had a few issues with the utilities, and he was ready to help! He couldn't have been nicer! This place was a great location. Would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I enjoyed staying at Adam's place in Austin.  The condo is accurately portrayed on Airbnb and was more than adequate for our needs.

My wife was attending a conference at the convention center and the apartment's close proximity to the convention center and the downtown Austin restaurants was a huge plus.  

Downtown Austin has quite an active nightlife and Adam's condo, while not on Sixth Street does get some late night noise -- as I'm sure every similarly located condo does.  If you can't tolerate some noise, don't stay downtown.

We had one communications related snafu when we arrived but Adam took care of that in a professional manner.

If we return to Austin, we would definitely stay in Adam's condo again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Comfy bed.  All in all it worked out well and I would definitely recommend this spot.  We were able to get in and out with relatively little hassle using the padlock and key, so no need to meet in person which is convenient.  I'd do it again."
,,,,,,,,"Being extremely close to the conference centre, Adam's downtown location is perfect for a young professional.  I was able to easily walk to all downtown locations for shopping and night life and I was a simple twenty minute walk to the east side music and arts community.  I'm very impressed with Adam and the ease of transactions.  Even after my flight was delayed a day, Adam was able to book me for another night.  Experience Austin like you have lived there for years."
,,,,,,,,"Pros:

The location was amazing. You couldn't beat it for that. Right downtown, super close to everything. It was clean. The bed was comfortable. Adam was very responsive to messages.

Cons:

When we arrived, Adam let us know where we could find the fob to the parking garage. The fob didn't work. We texted Adam and he responded immediately but let us know that either we would have to replace the batteries or he could get us batteries that evening. So we trekked over to CV Pharmacy and found batteries and a screwdriver (at a cost of about $10) so we could park.

Internet didn't work at first and certainly wasn't very fast. But again, not really why you're staying there probably.

The place is VERY loud at night. Conversations in the courtyard, street noise, it all comes through. I can imagine SXSW might be a little hellish.

The place itself isn't exactly... welcoming. It's devoid of decoration and has very little in it. That's okay, I guess, that's not what you're in Austin for. But there was not much going for it in the looks department.

We couldn't find towels at first until we realized they were in the dryer. So they were clean, at least.

The couch is described as being like a bed so we had assumed it was a bed. It's not, its just a couch. So don't expect to really sleep anyone on that comfortably.

Overall, not bad. Kind of expensive and I've had much better AirBnB experiences before. Great location though."
,,,,,,,,"Well, the location of this condo is excellent. As everyone else says, its right in the middle of everything. Actually getting inside was a bit of a hassle as the lockbox was jammed or something, the front gate keypad code didn't work and neither did the parking lot remote to open the gate. Once we got the keys out of the jammed lockbox, we could get through the gate and into the condo no problem, but we had to wait for someone else to either leave or enter the parking area before we could get in or out ourselves. The condo itself is nice with nice furnishings. No TV in the main room and the TV in the  bedroom didn't work which wasn't a huge deal to us, but just a heads up I guess. Apparently there was a mix up and the place was not cleaned before we got there, but he had the cleaning guy over in about an hour. We were in town for a concert, so we really only need a place to crash for one night and it did the job there, once we were able to get in."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location in the city. Super close to everything. Very clean and neat place. Would come and stay again. 
,,,,,,,,Great location central to the city. Adam was easy to work with and the entire process was incredibly easy. Have already recommended the location to another group of friends.
,,,,,,,,"Adam was quite responsive to our questions and needs. He inadvertently gave us the wrong code for the lock box which necessitated a late night text until we had navigated the lock box, the entry system and the parking area. Slightly clearer instructions would have saved some of this difficulty!
The condo was as advertised and was nicely cleaned. We had intermittent internet service - it would be out for several hours at a time. This is a condo in the heart of downtown Austin. Do not expect a quiet night's sleep if you choose this listing. The courtyard is on one side and the street is on the other. Conversations lasted until 2AM on weeknights and 5AM Friday night. "
,,,,,,,,Location is the best part of this place. Since we were visiting it was great to be able to walk almost anywhere we went. Listing was accurate and Adam was very responsive and made sure we were able to get in. He also made sure we knew we could contact him for anything during our stay. Great host.
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 81 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Adam was a great host, really helpful. The apartment is in the perfect location if you want to experience downtown Austin. It's small, but very comfortable and nicely furnished. Has everything you need to call it home for a night or a few days."
,,,,,,,,Adam's place was great! very clean and a perfect location. He was very responsive with inquiries. Would definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place in Austin was excellent! The key was easy to find and the condo is just like the picture. There was a problem with the Internet, but Adam was very responsive and it was fixed quickly. Plenty of room for a couple or two. Great space for me as a business traveller, plenty of room to spread out and do my work. EXCELLENT location, I walked everywhere I needed to go. Will definitely check this place out again if I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome 10/10 location. Right in the heart of it, but on a quiet street and easy access. Lots of food/drink options in close proximity. Very functional unit, ideal for a couple, small family or 2 singles. The plunge pool is a great little bonus for this listing.

Adam was just a text message away and responded immediately to a quick question we had."
,,,,,,,,Incredibly convenient downtown location with secure parking. Plenty of space to spread out as a business traveler. 
,,,,,,,,"Location, location, location. This was in the heart of everything for the conference I was attending around the 6th/Brazos area. If you're in Austin to enjoy anything happening downtown, this is ideal in terms of location. The actual condo was very clean, very tidy and the recliners are fantastic after a long day of lots of walking. This condo is right next to the pool and I could hear conversations/noise while in the living room, however, I was amazed at how little (if any) noise I heard from the pool or the street while in the bedroom. Thanks Adam!"
,,,,,,,,The condo was in a perfect location for me to access the Convention Center-about a block and a half from door to door. I was able to communicate with Adam by text once I arrived to get better instructions on how to get into the complex and find the unit.  It was just as represented in the photos and suited my purposes.  Loved Austin!!
,,,,,,,,"I was really looking forward to staying here as the pictures and description looked great.
Finding the apartment and getting the key was really an easy and smooth process.
Unfortunately on our arrival the apartment hadn't been cleaned from the previous user which was disappointing after 16 hours travelling. Adam dealt with it quickly and had cleaners round in an hour or so. 
I wouldn't say this apartment could fit five people comfortably as there wasn't an air mattress available. We made up the sofa for a bed for our two other guests which was ok for one night. 
The apartment doesn't look as homely as it does in the photos with no pictures on the walls or lamps in the bedrooms. 
The apartment is in a great location and a nice building. "
,,,,,,,,Adam was a great host. Friendly and available as soon as I arrived by phone and text to answer questions. The location can't be beat if you are attending a conference at the convention center. Appliances are all new and everything was clean and organized. Wifi is screaming fast. Bring a swimsuit - I was wishing I had as soon as I saw the pool. Try the acai bowl place across the street for breakfast too! Great space. Great host.
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful apartment. Exactly as the photos show. Incredibly clean and comfortable and Adam made it super simple to get the keys, etc.

I'll definitely check to see if this place is available next time I come to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Adam was great! Anything we asked for he got for us immediately. The apartment is exactly like the pictures and the location made it easy to walk anywhere downtown. 
2101788,4.5,9,10,9,10,10,9,The location is fantastic and the house was just what I needed.  
,,,,,,,,"Host response was great.  Home is in good location and has a good laid back feel, but needs serious renovation.  Neighbor was rude (I don't think he likes the house being rented out).  House was way overpriced.  "
,,,,,,,,TurnKey rentals was very professional and provided us with everything we needed for our stay. They even let us check in early!
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay! The house was very clean and cozy. The location can not be beat. We enjoyed walking at the park across from Barton Springs Rd. The backyard was very nice with plenty of seating.  We will definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"The house was great and centrally located to all the amenities we needed! It felt just like home and was a comfy stay while in town for work. We would definitely book again! Thanks, Erica!"
,,,,,,,,"Wonderfully charming older home with all the amenities you could need and in a great location. A few bars and restaurants are 2 blocks away and other great places just a mile away: the shops/restaurants/bars of South Congress, the Alamo Drafthouse, or watching the bats on Congress Bridge. Everything else (6th street, Rainey St) was an easy uber ride away for rarely more than $5. The company that manages the property keeps you very informed of all the procedures and important items...like wifi code. Very appreciated!  And there is no key to try to arrange or deal with...just a code on the lock on the door to enter. A binder of great info is inside as well. We loved the back deck that looks on the Austin skyline. Had a fantastic time!  Thanks heaps!"
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood and the location made it easy to get to everywhere in town. Big backyard to relax, grill and have dinner on the big deck.

Bathroom is quite outdated and not in a trendy midcentury modern style, just outdated. My buddies and I were fine with it, but my wife would not have enjoyed it.  "
,,,,,,,,Place was great and clean.  Great location.  They have the automated bike rentals near by which we loved.  Uber to Rainey St was only $10.  Great stay.
,,,,,,,,"Great place. Great location, easy to access. We were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. The deck and back yard are excellent. There were 4 beds available, not including the sofa (1 cot). None where particularly private. Three of them are in the great room with only curtains separating them. The final is in a separate room, but this also has no door, just a curtain. This suited our needs just fine, but may not be fore everyone.

The management seemed attentive and kept us informed via email throughout the process"
,,,,,,,,Great location. Clean 
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 56 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"The house was nice and clean. I would say the best part of it is the porch. Location is great, very centric and convenient. You're like 10 min walking distance from the lake and south congress. I would definitely recommend for anybody to stay here. Description and price range are also very accurate. 
Thanks! "
,,,,,,,,"I'm not sure what they use to wash the towels, but it's seriously incredible.  This place is in an amazing location to experience the best of Austin.  Me and my 4 friends were very comfortable, and found the place clean an orderly.  The coffee in the fridge was nice bonus!

Erica was very responsive to my questions and easy to book with."
,,,,,,,,Great and quiet place for SXSW!. Close to the events.
14406827,5,10,10,10,10,10,10, Absolutely perfect location! Right by 6th street and all their wonderful bars. Walked to Voodoo donuts in 5 mins.We could even walk to Rainey street without a problem. Not to mention the bars right across the street were  a perfect way to end the night on the way home. Lauren's place was super comfortable and more than plenty of room for 3 people. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Great location for work and play. Clean and comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was in a great location, we walked almost everywhere we went! It was very clean and photos are exactly as it they looked. We were all pleased with our stay here. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place! Right in the heart of downtown. Quiet but easy to walk to so much like 6th st, the Driskill, Coopers BBQ and several coffee places. Easy to get around either driving or using a ride share.   Place was gorgeous, well decorated and very clean. Pictures are accurate. All the amenities you need. We would love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great. Very reasonable price for a clean, new and spacious apartment right downtown close to everything I needed to be near for a work trip with a couple of evenings out. The kitchen is very well set up and the bathroom is very nice. The only minor issue I had was that being a ground floor unit, the noise from trash collection at about 4am on a Tuesday was quite jarring but it only lasted for 5-10 minutes. "
,,,,,,,,"This was in a perfect location! Especially if you are in town for a conference or to enjoy Austin night life.

Lauren was very accommodating and responsive. 100% would recommend to anyone and would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment exceeded my expectations. Absolutely immaculate, excellent location, and gracious host. "
,,,,,,,,Great spot and EXACTLY as advertised
,,,,,,,,"We LOVED staying in Lauren's cute condo. Four of us had a girls weekend in Austin, and this was the perfect place for us to stay. It's in an office space, which was kind of an odd place to find a condo, but it was done up SO well. Some of the things we loved --
Location: it's next door to a liquor store, across the street from a fun bar, and about a block away from a CVS. We walked to dirty 6th, graffiti park, and south congress from the condo. Literally couldn't have asked for a better location! 
Layout: big bathroom and closet - big enough for four girls to get ready at once! Full kitchen with everything you'd need - microwave, coffee pot, blender, toaster oven, etc. Two beds big enough to share, and the couch was comfy enough to nap on as well. 
I really can't say enough good things about Lauren's condo! If (when!) I return to Austin, I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great downtown location.  Conveniently situated within walking distance of everything.  Very cute place - nicely furnished - the bed was really comfortable.  Lauren was very helpful & responsive.
,,,,,,,,"A unique and charming space, this listing was everything we were expecting from the description. Although our group's stay was short (one night), but we loved how quickly we were able to feel at home in this converted condo. We found the space clean and had all the amenities that we needed. The location was also very convenient to the city's night life.

Lauren made arrival easy and answered questions quickly throughout our stay. Although the condo doesn't have a parking spot, the host did make several suggestions that worked out great."
,,,,,,,,"Lauren's apartment was great! I was traveling for business to Austin and this apartment is ideally located within walking distance to the Austin Convention Center, great restaurants and bars and all of the places I needed to go. "
,,,,,,,,Lauren's place was great! Right downtown and so convenient to anywhere you need to go. We stayed for ACL and we were able to walk to Zilker! There is no parking at the apartment so just plan ahead where to park your car. I would definitely suggest staying at Lauren's place! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, very comfortable, perfect size for 4 people. AC works well. Shower and whirlpool was great. Easy access to downtown hotspots. Fare (uber knockoff) readily available at all times in this area. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome condo, great location, responsive host.  Couldn't ask for more, highly recommended!

It's worth noting that one of the beds is very comfortable, the second bed is average and the third is a slightly uncomfortable futon bed.  Most people won't notice or mind but a high maintenance sleeper like myself might want to avoid the futon bed."
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely LOVED staying at this Air BNB! It was very clean, very accurate to the pictures, and in an awesome location. It's right downtown, right off of 6th street - very easy to get to. She even had extra toiletries and all cleaning supplies ready for us."
,,,,,,,,Lauren's condo was perfect for our stay! It couldn't be in a better location in downtown Austin and she was responsive to any questions that we had. Everything was very clean and as depicted! 
,,,,,,,,Great location and beautiful space - photos are very accurate. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location in downtown Austin -- close to everything you may want to see and experience in town. Amenities are good, with efficient AC and condo is spacious. However, one side faces into an alley, and trucks start coming there around 3:30 am for deliveries, making quite a lot of noise (I realize this may not be within the host's control, but needs to be noted). Otherwise, building is quiet (all other units are probably offices, therefore empty on weekends). 
Also, if you drive your own car, cheapest parking is about $25/day. "
3349679,4.5,9,10,9,9,10,9,"Amazing apartment, exactly as advertised. Trip Top team was there to help every step of the way"
,,,,,,,,"Noisy like the warning states but it is downtown Austin!!  Ear plugs were in the bathroom and worked great!  Place is clean, comfortable, roomy and great location. "
,,,,,,,,"Location was great, place was nice and clean.  Would recommend staying here in the heart of downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great location and good price. thanks!
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay, the location was amazing and Top Trip Rentals made everything easy.  They were very prompt with replies as it was our first time to the Austin area.  Everything was easy to locate, their welcome packet made everything a breeze.  I was in town with some girlfriends and we were celebrating my birthday, the team bought me cupcakes and a card and right off the bat I knew I made a great decision.  Not knowing much about the city in general, they were able to give me ideas about how to get around town, where to eat, things to do.  The location was exactly what I wanted, in downtown in the middle of everything!  I would definitely book with Top Trip Rentals again for sure!"
,,,,,,,,Lovely accommodations. Right in the middle of it downtown on 6th!  Check out park side one block away for some great drinks. Bed was comfy and (as mentioned in advance) the environment is a little noisier than a hotel. Not a problem for us though. Shower had great pressure & temperature but was really built for shorter people. Wifi was available.  Parking was a little bit expensive because of downtown location. They did offer a deal that they had worked out with a parking garage.  Would go back there to stay and great communication from the owners/management...
,,,,,,,,"Great location!  Only a couple of blocks from where the metro drops you off from the airport, you are literally in the middle of a vibrant Austin with everything within walking distance.  The loft is in great condition and the hosts make everything easy and accessible.  I would highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Host was great, very hospitable, great communication and excellent service!"
,,,,,,,,It was a Party of Five Guys. And we had absolutely no problems with staying in this place. It is loud outside but the walls do a really good job of keeping most of the noise out. I actually chose to sleep on the downstairs couch instead of one of the twin beds because the couch is so comfortable. It's in a perfect location 2 blocks away from breakfast tacos for in the morning.  And right on 6th Street. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay right on 6th Street. You're not going to find a better deal than this place. Thank you so much top trip rentals for hosting us we had a terrific weekend.
,,,,,,,,"The location for this Airbnb is excellent! Easy to bus to and from the airport and right in the thick of things on 6th. It is a bit noisy, but we weren't bothered. The rental was entirely as advertised and accommodated our group of 4 just fine. We appreciated the opportunity to have an early bag drop as well as a late check-out. Communication with Sandra was easy and prompt. All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this rental and would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"I needed to go to Austin for a last minute work trip and Top Trip rental worked out well. It was in walking distance of everything I needed (i.e., work office, Royal Blue Grocery, CVS, Hideout coffee, & Houndstooth coffee). As I was there for work, the thoughtful touches for a work-oriented traveler throughout the loft were great. All of the communications (emails, welcome packets, etc.) with Top Trip were prompt and very much appreciated. "
,,,,,,,,"Central location, great apartment, wonderful service and care from Top Trip. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,The folks at Top Trip Rentals were very professional and followed up with us before and during our stay.  The apartment description was accurate and exceeded our expectations in terms of comfort and location.  The property is comfortably decorated and in a great central location. The host also thoughtfully checked with us to make sure we were ok with noise coming from lively 6th Street.   We couldn't have been happier with our choice to stay here and noise was never a problem.  
,,,,,,,,"This is the perfect location if you are interested in exploring downtown Austin and ""dirty 6th""!!!  This beautiful apartment had all the amenities one would need during a weekend stay.  One queen bed, 2 single beds, 1 day bed and a super comfy couch - made it convenient for 5 people to share this space!  Chereen, Kalyn, and Sandra were extremely helpful and super sweet!!  Having coffee in the apartment was a life saver on our early mornings :)  Couldn't have asked for a better spot to celebrate an amazing weekend in Austin!!  Can't wait to visit Austin again and stay in a Top Trip Rental property."
,,,,,,,,"We booked this spot last minute for SXSW and it was perfect. Best location, free parking in building and free snacks / bottled water on every level!  Best Airbnb experience I have had so far, host was efficent and we had an amazing stay."
,,,,,,,,"This was an awesome experience! My friends and I came into town for SXSWedu. From the very beginning, TopTrip was extremely responsive to e-mails. The location is right on 6th street so there is easy access to live music, restaurants, and bars. It's also right by the convention center (~5 min walk). 

The loft itself was convenient. It was really convenient to have keyless entry! It made it really easy to not have to coordinate getting keys to everyone. Everyone could come as go according to their schedule. There was a great welcome folder that laid out transportation options, wifi information, and more which made it easy to get settled easy. They even have a TV with a roku so you can relax and watch shows.

The queen and king beds upstairs were awesome! The two sleeper beds are right in front as you enter. We didn't mind it that much and it's great for a group of friends, but judge if that is right for your group. It's an open layout so also check to see if that's right for your group. Our group didn't have an issue with it. Because there is an upstairs and downstairs, it was easy to change, etc. with privacy. 

The other guests and I didn't have any issues with noise coming from 6th Street. It's high enough that the sound gets drowned out. But, the bathroom had earplugs just in case which I thought was a nice touch.

We didn't make use of it,  but they have a fully stocked kitchen.

Also, random note, but there's a Gold's Gym right on the first floor if you need a gym. It costs about ~$15/day.

Entire experience was great! Super clean loft that is great for exploring Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We ventured to Austin to surprise a good friend for his birthday and this place was perfect. There were 5 of us guys staying 3 nights, and everyone slept comfortably the entire time. The standout for me was the view from the 2nd level of the loft - it overlooks 6th Street and it's beautiful during the day and exciting as the night comes and you see people from all over shuffle in for a night of debauchery. I'd recommend staying here for a guy's (or girl's) weekend and I'd definitely recommend Top Trip Rentals - they were extremely communicative and made us feel very welcome. They provide a listing of things to do but you can never go wrong with Lavaca St. Bar or anywhere on Rainery St."
,,,,,,,,Great location! In the middle of any and everything! I will definitely reserve this place again! 
,,,,,,,,Great experience! Fantastic location and traffic/excitement from 6th Street wasn't loud at all (though we were there Monday through Wednesday). Comfortable beds. Nice kitchen. Clean bathroom. Would definitely recommend! Thanks guys!!!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin. The top trip team were great passing us all the info on time.
The apartment was fantastic, perfect for 4 guys who wanted to enjoy the Austin bar scene."
,,,,,,,,"This apartment in Austin is the only way to stay in that great city. With two levels, four beds, plus a couch, our group was all set for the week. The place is right on 6th Street, so there's a commotion outside right up until 2:00am, but it didn't bother us conventioneers one bit."
,,,,,,,,"The communication was good overall. I appreciated the company allowing us to have a late check out. However we were moved at the last minute to unit #504 which wasn't in great condition (marks on the walls, a big dent in the bathroom door, etc) my sheets had stains on them (though they were clean) and worst of all, there was an insect problem. We killed four giant bugs in the first 36 hours. The company sent a cleaning crew out right away and also set some traps, but since I found one bug in my bed I slept on the couch instead. The location is great -- I didn't mind the noise with ear plugs. But the bugs were gross and the place was not in great condition. "
,,,,,,,,"Accommodation was as described and perfect for what we were looking for, being very central to 6th Street and its bars and restaurants. We had no problem with noise but can understand that this wouldn't be everybody's choice. Facilities are good, parking straightforward and getting into the property is very easy even though we arrived late  "
,,,,,,,,Great location and was a very nice stay.
,,,,,,,,Loft was as advertised and fit our needs for the weekend well.  Place is clean enough but could use an updated bath tub area.  Shower head is extremely low.  Communication with hosts was excellent.  Process for entering loft is great.  I can't imagine a better location.  It is noisy at night as the host points out.  But that is why you look to stay on 6th street. 
,,,,,,,,Top trip rentals were very responsive to any questions I had throughout my stay. They made sure to check in regarding arrival and departure time to make sure I had everything I needed. The neighborhood and posting was exactly as described and is a great spot if you have a larger group staying with you!
,,,,,,,,"The place is literally right on 6th so the ease of access was a 10 out of 10, but with that said, if you aren't going out, it does get a little noisy. The only minor problem was the shower changing temperatures on us. Love the new no key access! Will definitely rent again if we ever come back. "
,,,,,,,,"Thank you for such a positive first AirBnB experience. Just how it was listed. Appropriate to sleep up to six and right on 6th St across from the historic Driskill hotel. Please note that since it IS on 6th, the bar scene can carry into the loft. However, that wasn't something that wasn't communicated prior to my stay. Awesome communication! Thank you again. "
,,,,,,,,Everyone we dealt with was very friendly and responsive. Free snacks was a nice touch. 
,,,,,,,,"The host was great, everything was ready and accurate as described when we arrived. The location was excellent if looking to be close to 6th street and downtown. Being at this location made our our lives easier during our stay for getting around downtown. Since you are right in the heart of the action on 6th street it does get loud late into the night, which we knew ahead of time and were prepared for. Top Trips was easy to reach and helpful with all questions and needs while we there."
,,,,,,,,I'm very comfortable and convenient stay!! I would like to stay next year.
,,,,,,,,The place was amazing. Very comfortable and clean. Definitely will be renting from yall again.
,,,,,,,,"I was really impressed with all the information that Top Trip Rentals provided. Even after requesting, they wanted to ensure I'd read the description and was aware about the sound coming in from the street. The apartment was great, very clean and comfortable.  Like they mentioned, there was some noise from the street until about 2am. It might not be an ideal place if you're staying for business, but if you're coming into Austin for fun, this is the place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,The description is very accurate.   The building is showing its age and the rooms have a dorm feel to them.  These are economy accommodations.  The music was not a problem at all.  The management team was responsive. 
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood is great. I mean you are looking down on to 6th street. It was easy to get in and out of the building and check in was easy with the lock box for the key. The host made sure I was ready with all the information I needed when before I arrived in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Check in was very easy and the hosts provided a detailed arrival/info packet. The apartment was clean and comfortable. It is also very, very central. South Congress is even just a 10min stroll over the bat bridge. The hosts left us lots of ear plugs although we didn't need them. The noise from 6th street wasn't that loud (we even stayed on weekend nights). I recommend this location if you want to stay right in the heart of downtown."
,,,,,,,,This location was perfect for our itinerary! The room was as described and was a great value for our group! Will definitely book again.
,,,,,,,,"Everything was as advertised. The street noise was more than we expected, but the host has nothing to do with that. The apartment was clean, well furnished, and well presented. No problems getting in or with the overall instructions. "
,,,,,,,,"Rented this unit for the Austin Film Festival and the location was superb. Right across from The Driskoll hotel and on 6th Street, walking distance to anything you need. Great host and unit! Highly recommend for those wanting to partake in the downtown Austin scene. "
,,,,,,,,Everything with the apartment was as advertised. Management was extremely responsive and helpful. I strongly recommend this place.
,,,,,,,,It was fantastic! This is the second time we stayed downtown with Top Trip in Austin! I can always count on them to great experiences!
,,,,,,,,"Location was perfect for our get together. Close to UT campus and other points of interest. The loft was clean and well organized. Balcony was entertaining for people watching. Wasn't overly noisy considering the proximity to 6th Street, but there are complimentary ear plugs. Highly reccommend this location if you're in Austin for non-business purposes. Our host was extremely friendly and courteous. They answered all of our questions and were extremely welcoming & professional!"
,,,,,,,,"Check in was fast and easy and the hosts were very quick to respond through the entire reservation experience.  The balcony literally overlooks all of the action of downtown Austin and the location is really convenient.  The unit definitely lets in the street noise from the party scene below, but that was expected and clearly explained in the property description.  Earplugs and a noise machine were even provided.  The building has a secure entry out front and there were a limited number of access cards available, so make sure your group is ok with sharing keys.  Overall a good experience and the hosts were delightful to deal with. Location can't be beat for walkability. "
,,,,,,,,"Top Trip was great to deal with. They sent timely info, were available when I needed to call and the place was just as the pictures showed- very clean and stylish. I especially loved being able to stand out on the balcony and look down on 6th street- a truly urban feel."
1875121,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This was the third time we've booked with Melissa.  She's our neighbor, and we rent her sweet cottage for friends and family who come to visit.  Another wonderful experience.  Can't recommend this place enough."
,,,,,,,,"This airb&b was by far the best airb&b I have ever been in. It was a lovely space with a great kitchen and washroom. The bed was comfortable and the location couldn't have been better. I loved this place. My boyfriend and I spent the holidays here and it was perfect. We could come and go as we pleased and it felt like out own place for that week. 

I would highly recommend staying here if you have the chance. "
,,,,,,,,"This small back house is a great place to stay in Austin.  It accommodates my wife, baby and I perfectly.  It's close to downtown and numerous food trucks.  It's got a nice feel to it.  We really enjoyed the location and the amenities.  "
,,,,,,,,"The perfect location + set up for our weekend getaway to Austin. The cottage is close enough to restaurants, grocery stores, downtown, live music, etc. however, it is secluded and in a quiet neighborhood. "
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at this little cottage. It was located centrally to everything we wanted to see and do.  Great restaurants within walking distance and hip bars. The place was private, clean, and had all we needed.  Neighborhood is peaceful.  Melissa was a great host and answered to whatever we needed promptly.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,Great space that is close to downtown and local restaurants. Great for a taste of local Austin living.
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I traveled to Austin for a UT football game and stayed at the Urban Cottage. We can't say enough about how wonderful our experience was! The place was adorable and the location was unbeatable; a quick walk to downtown 6th, Rainey Street (our favorite),  East Austin, and a ton of great bars/restaurants/coffee shops. We rented a 3 day B-cycle pass and explored the city that way - highly recommend doing that. Melissa set out city maps, bus schedules, and a long list of recommendations for things to do/eat/drink in the area. A tip for guests who are flying into Austin, take the 100 metro bus from the airport. It's $1.75 per person and makes multiple stops downtown, one of which is only about a 10 minute walk from the cottage.
The home was secure in the back yard of the homeowners, and had a custom lock for our private entry. Inside, the cottage was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with bathroom supplies and some light kitchen snacks. We'll definitely stay here again when we revisit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent host and great accommodations. The place was clean, cozy, and conveniently situated. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa made me feel very welcome and at ease from the moment I booked the reservation. She was very responsive. Her husband welcomed us in person when we arrived and was very friendly. The cottage is adorable and comfortable. They provided a wonderful guide to their favorite restaurants, bars and other spots in the area. The cottage is just a couple walking blocks to Sixth Street. "
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was in a great location- and walking distance to what became our favorite breakfast food truck- The Paperboy. YUM.
Melissa and her husband were great hosts and made everything easy. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone traveling to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I had 4 wonderful nights in Melissa and Dave's lovely little cottage in their backyard. The cabin is so fine and tastefully decorated.
Thank you for the fine suggestions for good places to eat, which we frequently used."
,,,,,,,,This is a great little cottage behind the main house in an up and coming neighborhood in Austin. The house and amenities are in great condition and offer everything you need to enjoy a wonderful time in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"I cannot say enough good things about this cottage and Melissa! My fiance and I eloped during our stay and Melissa was so very helpful when I came to her with questions about the area. The cottage itself was the perfect size, awesome decor, and felt like our own little getaway tucked in the back of her property. Location was amazing too as we were out and about alot celebrating and there was no shortage of bars and restaurants to walk to! Would recommend this listing to anyone and would love to come back for our first anniversary!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's cottage was just perfect for me and a friend for our Austin trip. It's super cute and private, but still just three blocks from some great and quirky nightlife and restaurants. If you like live music and independent bands, definitely check out the nearby Hotel Vegas. 

I would totally come back. One of my favorite airbnbs I've stayed at. :)"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's place is a darling guesthouse on the main property of the very cool East Austin area. Everything was exactly as pictured, communication was exemplary and we really enjoyed the outdoor decking in the morning when the sun was up. There is some construction on the main property however this did not affect us at all and we would not have known it was going on.
I would love to stay again - thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Cute little cottage at the back lot of a house (that is at the time of my stay under construction). You've got to pick your way past the mess but the place itself is exactly as pictured and a nice place to stay that is located in a quiet suburb close to all the things you'll want to get to.
,,,,,,,,"Loved my stay here!!  Awesome location, beautiful cottage!"
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying in the cottage! The host is very helpful and everything was set up perfectly when I arrived. It had everything I needed and is in a super convenient location. And so many great breakfast options within walking distance - Blue Dahlia Bistro, Paperboy, Vintage Heart Coffee...yum! Definitely will stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place to stay. Total quaint Austin vibe, close to everything, cool decor and super easy.  Was deciding between hotel and AB&B and this was the best.  Kitchen was perfect and fridge with some sparkling water and mexican coke to  welcome us.  So nice... "
,,,,,,,,"Just perfect. Clear directions to enter and lock up, comfy bed and blessed air conditioning. Appreciated the complimentary coffee and topochiko too!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's place was exactly what I was looking for! It was close to so many great places, and comfortable as well! I would definitely recommend it to others."
,,,,,,,,"Melissa is a great host. The process could not have been easier. The cottage was very cute, and perfect for 2 of us staying 4 nights. The location was very convenient to downtown, but with its own residential charm."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay here was great! It's a nice cozy guesthouse with many accommodations. From air conditioning to bath towels to beverages to extra pillows made our stay amazing. The location was perfect to many sites, especially downtown. If you enjoy walking then this is the place for you. Only a mile or two from tourist spots.
We had the pleasure of meeting Melissa and her husband. They were nice and checked up on our needs."
,,,,,,,,"Melissa was so accommodating after our flights were delayed and we got in much later than expected. She was super easy to communicate with and so nice! As for the cottage, it was the perfect place for us in Austin. It was adorable and had everything we needed, was very clean, and was in a great location. We used B-cycle (bike rental stations) to get around and the guesthouse is within walking distance to many stations. It is also walking distance to a fun part of town. The bed was very comfortable. The only drawback is that there was construction going on during our stay that could possibly wake a light sleeper in the morning. Not a huge issue for us though, plus, the rate was discounted as Melissa mentions in the description due to the construction. I would definitely come back to Melissa's urban cottage!"
,,,,,,,,"This cottage was an absolutely perfect base for our first trip to Austin! It was well situated and very comfortable! We didn't meet Melissa but she was available to message at any time, she had prepared a booklet of good places to eat, drink etc in the local area. All around a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend "
,,,,,,,,"This house was amazing. In such a good location and so cute. Because it's a guest house and not in the main house, it feels like your own private retreat. I was in Austin conducting research at library. The cottage served as an amazing little writing retreat. I would recommend this place in a second. It's really awesome, and the owners were super nice and accessible. The construction being done on their main house was not an issue at all. "
,,,,,,,,"Melissa was very welcoming, communicated clearly and was very friendly. We loved the cottage - it is a very comfortable and inviting space and in a great location. It is quiet in their neighborhood and yet walking distance to downtown activities. We would stay again if we come back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great space and convenient location very close to downtown. We didn't cross paths with our host during our stay, but Melissa was very accommodating and communication was quick and reliable. The construction didn't bother us and the workers stayed out of our way. This listing was bright, clean, and definitely felt like a home away from home. Would definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Thanks so much for having us to stay! Although we never met you, which is a real shame, we felt very much at home! 
Super cute wee cottage with great local tips for us to use, we loved having dinner at Salt and Time!
"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place for staying while attending a small conference downtown.  Parking fees downtown are at least quadruple a roundtrip cab ride from here (cab from here to Driskell was about $5).  Clean, quiet, very private space.  Great recommendations for area food and bev from host.  Melissa was awesome in communication...especially when I left something in the cottage which she made sure to put in an easy to pick up location.  There is major renovation in building in front and many surrounding properties of cottage.  This was no problem for me but you will see/hear lots of construction during daytime hours.  I will bookmark this as the place to stay when I come to Austin for business again."
,,,,,,,,"What to say about this lovely cottage.  For one, the location is perfect!  You are only blocks away from 6th street and delicious eateries.  Plus, it is only a short walk to downtown.  I booked this place for the weekend while I was enjoying the ATX Television Festival.  After a long day at the convention it was nice to come back home to somewhere nice and cozy.  Melissa is amazing and I even got to talk to her several times over my stay while they were fixing up the main house.  I would easily stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Information for checking in was readily available.  Also, our flights got cancelled and we had to make some changes with transportation and Melissa was very helpful with recommendations with last minute messaging!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's Airbnb is in a great location in East Austin, close to lots of bars and restaurants. The cottage itself is very cute and well furnished inside. It's very rustic, so don't expect amenities like in a hotel. The fridge was stocked with coke and seltzer water, which was a nice touch.

My one complaint is that we found out the night before that the main House in front of the cottage was undergoing renovation. This was a fairly significant construction job. The workers woke us up at 8am on our first day. Melissa was very responsive to try to ensure that they would try to be more quiet the rest of our stay. But in any event, you basically have to walk through a construction site to get to the cottage. It was also clear that no one has really paid attention to the cottage since the house has been undergoing renovation. The grass and plants around the cottage were all overgrown. For the price, I really wouldn't recommend staying here until the renovation is complete."
,,,,,,,,"I loved this home! The neighborhood was great and I was within a short walk to downtown. Uber was not available when I was in town this time around. I was actually glad because it encouraged me to walk a bit more â€“Â and I greatly enjoyed the 15-20 minute (or so) walk each day into different areas downtown! My advice? Skip driving and just walk if you can!

Melissa left a detailed list of her favorite neighborhood restaurants, which was really handy. I especially liked the Buenos Aires Cafe and Licha's Cantina â€“Â I was a repeat customer at both spots during my week in the neighborhood. Excellent food!

The cottage was as pictured and everything worked perfectly inside. The decor was lovely too :) 

Other things I enjoyed while in Austin: 
*Brian's Brew (without a doubt their Summermoon latte is the best coffee I've ever had)
*Standup paddle boarding on the water (head to Four Seasons for rental info â€“ and it's close to the cottage, too!) 
*Paperboy was a fun breakfast food truck in the neighborhood and I don't recall seeing it on Melissa's list."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location for me (super convenient to downtown and easy to get to UTs campus) and close to lots of great eating. Very comfortable and bigger than it looked in the pictures. Melissa was great at communicating; checking in was easy. Would definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at the cottage for a 3 day trip for Dreamhack. This cottage was the perfect place to stay! The location is in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of street parking spaces. It is also a short walk to different coffee places in the surrounding area. 

The kitchen is well stocked with oatmeal, coffee, and cold refreshing beverages. Which was a big plus for me! The internet is really fast! My boyfriend and his two friends were able to play online games with each other, without any issues."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent little home, small nice touches of sparkling water in the fridge. Loved it"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our wee house for the week, it was ideal for our needs, clean, tidy, had everything we needed. Melissa and Dave came to meet us on arrival and had tips for things to do, places to see etc. The neighbourhood was really lovely, we were here for a music festival so we were coming back late (early morning) and had no problems at all and felt completely safe. It was a nice touch to have some mineral water and soft drinks in the fridge on arrival. The internet / wi-fi worked perfectly and was fast, which was great as we were reliant on this for keeping in touch with home, work etc. Both beds were comfortable. As one bed is effective in the kitchen / living room there isn't a lot of privacy for that person, but, in our case that wasn't really an issue, but could be for some people. If you are visiting downtown its an ideal base, but even if you are spreading your wings further Uber / Lyft etc. are cheap and we had no problems getting them to/from the house. All in all a great stay and we really enjoyed the accommodation"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's cottage was the perfect place to stay for our girls trip to Austin! It's a small space, but perfect for 2-3 people and beautifully put together. We had an issue with getting sheets for the pullout the first night, but Melissa was very quick to respond and resolve the issue. The East Austin neighborhood is great and Melissa's recommendations in the area were fantastic. I would highly recommend staying here as a couple or small group. We would definitely come back and stay at Melissa's place in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"We are repeat visitors to this cozy little cottage. We love it! A little home away from home within walking distance of restaurants, food trucks and music. Melissa and Dave are terrific hosts.
Thank you!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Melissa's cottage was wonderful!!  Everything was exactly as described and she was very accommodating and friendly!  The cottage has such great character and charm and the best part is that it is walking distance to literally EVERYTHING!!  Thanks, Melissa!  Would certainly recommend and stay with again."
,,,,,,,,"We couldn't have asked for a more perfect spot to stay while visiting Austin! This cute little cottage is within walking distance of downtown, 6th street and some of the best restaurants!  It was the perfect size for 2 people with everything decorated in such an adorable, charming way. The bed was also so comfortable!  Listen to Melissa's advice regarding places to eat. She was spot-on with each place we were able to check out! There was some construction to the main house going on, but it was honestly not noticeable at all.  Melissa was very considerate and helpful throughout our short, but wonderful trip! We would love to take an annual trip to Austin and would definitely love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa was great. I'm a very low maintenance business traveler and this place was perfect. After a long day and flight into Austin, I was exhausted. It was great to open the fridge and see Topo Chico waiting for me in the fridge. It's the little things that count!
Convenient spot for working/playing downtown. I will be back. "
,,,,,,,,"This was our first Air BnB experience and we were really happy with it!  The cottage is exactly as described and the location is even better than I expected.  It's just a couple minute walk to pretty much anywhere you would need/want to go in the more downtown area and a cheap Lyft ride to everywhere else.  Use Lyft though, coming from an Uber city I found out the hard way that Austin has 10x the number of Lyft cars and they are much cheaper.  The cottage is a great size for two.  I would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience with Melissa was wonderful.  She was always available if we had questions and was great about communicating with us for check-in/check-out.  Melissa was very flexible and understanding, allowing us to store our luggage at the cottage before check-in and after check-out because of our travel arrangements.  We absolutely loved the cottage, everything was so clean and well organized.  Melissa also provided us with a great guide to local restaurants, bars, and activities which came in handy.  The cottage is also in a good location for hanging out in their immediate neighborhood, but was also a manageable 15 min walk to the rowdy 6th st and was a bike ride away from Soco.  Looking forward to coming back and staying here again in Austin in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"Although we didn't get to meet Melissa, she was an amazing host.  Really helpful with extra requests, quick to respond to questions and genarally helpful all round!  We really enjoyed our stay and loved the location as it's easy to get to downtown and has some great local bars, restaurants and shops."
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay if you have a kid. We loved the location and fantastic places to eat around the area. Melissa's description of the place is spot on, and her guidebook was invaluable. We really appreciated how clean and organized the cottage was as well."
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I stayed at the house for four nights in March and we were genuinely sad to leave. The cottage is lovingly restored and just as it appears in the pictures. What you can't see are all the nice touches; fluffy towels, shampoo & creme rinse in the shower, bottles of Coke and seltzer in the fridge, and much more. The shower has great pressure and the mattress is very comfortable. This cottage gets a ten for comfort! 

The surrounding neighborhood is in transition with many houses under construction. The main house on the property is also being renovated but the crew was very considerate and friendly. The path along the side of the house is easy to navigate and well lit with automatic lights on sensors. The access to the house is a keypad lock with a combo set by the owner.

There are a number of great places to eat nearby. We loved Paper Boy, a food truck on 11th, and also the Quickie Pickie, which has a great cross-section of foods, brews and coffees. Uber and Lyft both operate in Austin and there were always cars close by. The longest wait we had was 5 minutes. 

The owners have also created a great guide to fun places, which is in the cottage. All in all it was a wonderful stay."
,,,,,,,,"I kinda want to write a bad review so no one else finds this adorable place... but that would be selfish. This place is great. Super cute, clean, amazing location, nice quite neighborhood. Everything you could ask for. So much more charming than a hotel. I would recommend this to anyone looking to spend some time in Austin.

-=b=-"
,,,,,,,,"Overall....fantastic experience!

Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,Melissa was very accommodating and the place is fantastic. Great location. I'll be back. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful visit to Austin!  Everyone was amazingly friendly, including our hostess Melissa.  She was quickly responsive to all of our needs and questions and provided great advice on where to eat and things to do while visiting.  The cottage was clean, cozy and welcoming and the bed was super comfortable. We would recommend this to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"Melissa made check in incredibly easy, and delivered our code for the door prior to our arrival. When we got to the cottage, there were pamphlets and other Austin related items on table which gave us a good idea of delicious places to eat (which we directly hit up!) Anything we needed, Melissa was speedy to respond. The cottage was convenient to downtown walking, and so we spent much of our time wandering the city by foot but we did occasionally use an Uber. We really loved the space and we definitely wouldn't hesitate to return! "
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's cottage was perfect for a long weekend in Austin.  The property was as described, very clean, and included all the essentials.  Most importantly, the location in east austin was amazing - a very short walk to great bars, restaurants, coffee, etc.  Melissa was also extremely communicative and accommodating, helping us change our reservation last minute due to flight cancellations.  I would highly recommend this listing!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in the Urban Cottage was as advertised - quiet and comfortable. Centrally located and within perfect striking distance of Franklin BBQ, we were able to enjoy everything we had planned for our weekend getaway while including some of the fantastic recommendations Melissa made available upon our arrival. "
,,,,,,,,"If you find yourself on this page deciding which stay is best for you, then look no further. This place is amazing. The cottage was clean, cozy and in a great location. Melissa has got to be hands down the best host I've encountered thu far. One night we had a problem with the widow three hours later is was fixed. Plus her food suggestions were fantastic. Thank you Melissa for making my visit in Austin perfect. "
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's place is very quiet and nice. Just as pictured. Pristine and comfortable, and a good location in East Austin. For some reason, though, the circle that indicates location on the listing shows West Austin. Important: This listing is East of I-35. There are a lot of great things east of I-35, and for plenty of reasons might be the part of Austin you'd rather stay in, but it was further from our conference site than the map suggested. If that location is good with you, then this place is every bit as great as described, but you will be a little bit further from downtown (capitol, convention center, UT campus) than you might think."
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's guest home was the perfect  place to ring in the New Year. It was located in the perfect location, walking distance to great restaurants and nightlife. Walking and bike rentals were all we needed. The guesthouse was super nice, seemingly newly remodeled, access was super convenient with code accessed lock. She was gracious enough to supply, coffee, sparkling water, sodas, oatmeal and even a surprise bottle of champagne left at our door on New Years Eve. She is super sweet and was very accommodating with check-in and out. Would absolutely stay again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This is a great cottage--very comfortable, well-stocked, and cute. The larger East Austin neighborhood is great too--quirky, easily accessible, and close to a lot of downtown attractions. The area has very good food and coffee options. Melissa is a good host. She responds quickly to text messages and emails. As the listing suggests, the main house is undergoing construction, so you should be prepared for that. Nothing that you can't handle, though. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect! The location was great and private. The bed was very comfortable. Thanks Melissa!
"
,,,,,,,,We loved the urban cottage! It is in a great location and very cosy and comfortable. Everything in the cottage is beautifully presented and we had everything we needed to make us feel at home. Melissa and Dave were so welcoming and helpful. The list of recommendations was invaluable and we ate at some fantastic restaurants in the area which we would not have known about. 
,,,,,,,,"Melissa is a great host-- very attentive and welcoming.  She is a great communicator and responds quickly if you have a question.  

The cottage is very charming, inside and out, and is exactly as advertised; the bed is so comfortable, and the kitchen amenities are great (really good coffee!).  There is a lot of privacy afforded by the trees surrounding the cottage, and yet it never feels too dark or secluded, either.

The neighborhood is safe, quiet, and convenient (you can walk to the Capitol in about 20 minutes, and there are some really fun bars and restaurants just a 5-10 minute walk away).

I would not hesitate to recommend staying at Melissa's cottage!"
,,,,,,,,Loved staying at Melissa's airbnb. The cottage was a bit hard to find but Melissa's instructions were helpful and very clear. The airbnb was everything we were expecting â€” including the red Smeg! Great location. I would recommend everyone to stay here for a weekend. 
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's place is great! Close to everything you need, and she pretty much gave us everything we needed anyway! Nice quiet spot but not far from the action at all. "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place for two people. The cottage was clean and charming, and we really enjoyed the list of neighborhood suggestions and 'insider scoop' from Melissa. Everyone must go to the Blue Dahlia!!  The neighborhood is still up & coming, but is safe, and quiet. We walked to the neighborhood spots, and took a very prompt Uber to go downtown Austin. One thing to note is that there is no television set in the cottage, so if that is important to you, heads up. Otherwise, it is a nice cozy space."
,,,,,,,,"Super fun, period cottage, plenty of room, cute furniture, plush towels, and ample kitchen.  Really clean - spotless.  Two air conditioners made it a cool retreat, and for a comfortable sleep.  Key/entry system was as easy as it gets.  I had a couple special requests for Melissa and she was helpful.  "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time and wouldn't hesitate to stay again. The cottage was perfect for two people, and Melissa made us feel welcome. A great spot."
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay in the cottage. Melissa was really great- she left us coffee and porridge (among other amenities) and some great recommendations of places to go and see in Austin! The cottage was very clean and beautifully decorated. Just as the pictures show. We would highly recommend this place to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,"My colleague and I both loved our stay at the Urban Cottage! The property was very charming and had absolutely everything we needed for our work trip to Austin. The neighborhood was ideal for walking to our conference downtown, and for exploring local dining and shopping options. We adored the hosts too! Melissa and her husband were very helpful with restaurant recommendations, and we felt lucky to have the chance to visit with them in person during our stay, because they were super friendly and also very knowledgeable about the neighborhood's history. We had a great time in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"This cottage is great in so many ways!  The location is fantastic and walking distance to several excellent East Austin restaurants as well as being easy to get downtown.  The overall space, cleanliness and amenities also exceeded expectations. We highly recommend this home and would definitely return on our next trip to Austin. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa is your perfect host! She was super friendly and informative. The cottage was within a relatively short walk to the convention center and far enough from busy streets to have peaceful sleep. Very clean, well maintained, and cozy! Free visitor street parking makes this a no brain'r. Why stay at a hotel? I know where I'm staying next November when I visit Austin again!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa was the perfect host.  She was super helpful and promptly responded to any inquiries we had.  Her cottage was very clean, comfortable and adorable.  When we arrived, we were thrilled to find delicious bubbly water in the cutest red fridge.  

The cottage was conveniently located, walking distance to the trendiest coffee shops and best restaurants.  The airport, Barton Springs and UT campus are a short cab ride away.  We would most definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The location is great!  Walkable to tons of eateries and bars, we liked the east side much better than downtown.  Clean and cute inside, would def. stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,Melissa's place was amazing.  Exactly as described and in a perfect location that was walkable or easy access to everywhere we wanted to go by Uber.  Melissa left a great list of restaurants and places to go in the cottage that was super helpful also.  I would love to stay here again-one of my favorite airbnb's thus far.
,,,,,,,,We loved the little house. The was in a great location convenient to restaurants and only a few blocks from 6th st.  The host provided coffee and mineral water. The space was clean and uncluttered. The bed was comfy and the bedding and towels are of good quality. We both agreed we would love to stay here again if we return to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"This cottage was amazing! Walking distance to so many things; 6th and Rainey street, Silo on 7th and more! Quick uber or cab rides to everything else you'd want to see. The cottage was amazing, so comfortable! Awesome hair dryer in the bathroom ladies and an iron in the room so don't waste the suitcase space! Would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone! "
,,,,,,,,"Location can't be beat. This unique cottage was perfect for my needs. Cozy, very clean and comfortable. Melissa was very quick to respond every question i had . I really felt at home and I would definitely stay here again in the future! "
,,,,,,,,"I cannot begin to explain how much we enjoyed staying here! The whole place is impeccably clean, private and adorable! We were able to walk easily downtown (just a few blocks to get to 6th St.)  and explore the city of Austin. Melissa was quick to respond to any questions we had and left with an awesome list of things to do, best places to eat (with her personal reviews).  We felt right at home and I slept like a rock in that bed, soft white sheets, fluffy comforter and the shower pressure was a total WIN!  I could go on and on about this place! So glad we found this gem! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful experience at the Urban Cottage in Austin.  The keypad lock made check-in and check-out super easy and flexible.  Once we arrived, Melissa had a parking pass waiting for us, so we could park on the street without getting ticketed/towed.  The cottage was great, well air-conditioned (crucial in August), and easy to access the rest of the city.  Upon arrival, we discovered a big list of restaurants, bars, and sightseeing suggestions, all close by.  The bathroom and bedroom were a perfect size for two of us.  We found the bed to be very comfortable.  Melissa was very responsive when we had questions.  She even went above and beyond and provided us lawn chairs when we decided to wait in line for Franklin BBQ (only 3 blocks away, a must do!).  We loved the location- if you are up for a bit of a walk, we made it to Rainey street, Sixth Street, and many restaurants and even breweries from the cottage.
I would highly recommend staying here if you travel to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Melissa was a great host. Everything was as described and the coffee and drinks in the fridge on arrival was a nice extra touch. The location is great and Melissa's recommendations for stuff to do and places to eat were really helpful
,,,,,,,,Flawless!  The location was perfect and the hosts were extremely accommodating.  High recommended to anyone looking for unique accommodations in East Austin.
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay in Austin. Melissa was very prompt and friendly with returning messages and everything was as it had been described.
My wife and I stayed in the cottage for an extended weekend, and the location was awesome for walking downtown to see a concert, with lots of local restaurants and cafe's in the immediate neighbourhood.
The cottage was clean and fresh, and the air conditioners did a good job of keeping it cool, even though it was very hot while we were in town (not that that should be a surprise for Texas in July!).
My only word of warning if you are reasonably tall is that the doorways are quite low. I banged my head quite a few times before I got in the habit of bending right over to walk between the rooms!"
,,,,,,,,We had a fantastic stay in Austin at Melissa's wonderful place. The cottage is clean spacious and very secure. The location was absolutely perfect for the bars and restaurants of 6th street and we had no problems with our car or parking. Everything was sorted for us by Melissa. They even supplied us lawn chairs in our long wait for Franklin's BBQ! We'd definitely recommend the cottage to family and friends visiting Austin and wouldn't hesitate to come back ourselves! Thanks again! 
,,,,,,,,"The Urban Cottage was the perfect place for our Austin getaway. The cottage's location made it easy to get around town, as most things were within walking distance or a short cab ride away. The cottage felt very homey and after walking through Austin on a hot day, we were so pleased to find that Melissa had left some cold drinks in the fridge for our arrival. Melissa was a great communicator and left an awesome neighborhood guide, outlining her favorite restaurants and coffee shops in the area. I wouldn't hesitate to book the Urban Cottage for my next trip to Austin if it's available!"
,,,,,,,,"The accommodations were great - a comfortable cottage nestled in a great neighborhood just east of 35.  Everything you want to see is within a 10 minute drive, $5 Uber, or 20 minute walk.  Walk to downtown, 6th street, Rainey St., etc.  

We appreciated the Mexican Coke's, Topo Chico waters, and coffee/tea.  I would recommend staying at Melissa's cottage for anyone visiting ATX!"
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was so adorable! My friend and I were gushing over how cute it was the entire time. It's well-designed, spacious, and private (away from the main house with it's own entrance). It seemed to be set up specifically for Air Bnb guests, and I appreciated that there were no personal items lying around, and plenty of space on shelves and in closets for your things. It was also very clean and spa-like with white fluffy towels.

I think our stay felt extra special with the details like sparkling mineral water and glass-bottle Cokes in the Smeg fridge, and personal suggestions on what to do and where to eat printed out on a piece of paper. Everything was very tastefully done.

The instructions for getting in and how to lock/unlock the door were very clear and easy. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here, and would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Comfortable and clean cottage in a great location in Eado, close to restaurants, bars, and coffee houses.  Everything from the kitchen to the bathroom is compact and cute."
,,,,,,,,"Met up with my best friend from England to have a few relaxing days in Austin as we'd never been there before (he is not getting married in September, so this was not in any way a bachelor weekend:).  Loved the apartment, perfect for us.  Sofa bed really comfortable.  Everything we needed.  Loved the little bottles of Topo Chico (a sparkling Mexican water) in the fridge, a beautiful orange Italian SMEG.  The neighborhood is wonderful. Initially we thought we would be west of 35 because the GPS location seemed a little off on the airbnb website, but we preferred where we were: close to good music at the White Horse, and good beer at Brew & Brew (I suppose they also sell coffee).  We didn't get chance to meet Melissa as I think she was travelling but Dave was super welcoming and helpful.  Austin is awesome, especially if you like the outdoor lifestyle.  I've never encountered so may fit people, nor a downtown so thankfully devoid of shops."
,,,,,,,,"I was unable to make the trip to Austin but my son, girlfriend and friend stayed in Melissa's Urban Cottage. Melissa responded quickly to any communication before and during the trip. The cottage was exactly as shown in the pictures and clean and comfortable. The water and cokes in the refrigerator were appreciated after a hot journey as was the air-con.
Conveniently and quietly situated, it was easy to get to see all that Austin had to offer.
"
,,,,,,,,"My best friend and I were visiting Austin for the first time and had an absolute blast! Melissa and Dave were fantastic hosts and their cottage is in a great location. Easy walk or cheap Uber ride into the city for great food, shopping and nightlife. The cottage was very clean and well-maintained, and the front door lock is programmable with an individual code for each guest, which makes check-in/out a breeze. If it wasn't for all the awesome things to do in the city, we would have loved to spend more time hanging out on the front porch enjoying the peaceful atmosphere. We'd stay again in a heartbeat and definitely recommend to anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a perfect trip. The weather was a little humid, but the accommodations were great. Melissa was easy to deal with and we loved the cottage. The neighborhood is central and has great food and little markets, I felt right at home."
,,,,,,,,We had a great time in the cottage. It was so central yet a great retreat from east downtown and very peaceful. We had many nights sitting on the porch watching fireflies and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Although we never met Melissa we had clear communication through the app and we met Dave who was lovely and very helpful. Definitely recommend staying here if you're in Austin - lovely place!
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was perfect. Very clean, private, quiet, and secure. The location to cafes, shops, bars, and restaurants on E 6th was fantastic and in general very centrally located. I didn't get to meet Melissa in person but communication was smooth and easy. I would definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"The cottage is an awesome place to stay in downtown Austin. Easy to walk right into the heart of the city, but a quiet safe neighbourhood away from the late night exuberance of Sixth Street. It's totally private with a personalised door code to get in. If we hadn't been out trying to see, hear and eat everything, it would have been a great place to relax. I understand the house itself is a local landmark - we came out one morning to find a school group on a field trip!

Contact was quick and easy - due to some transport chaos we weren't able to arrive as early as we'd hoped but Melissa was very flexible about our changing plans.

Melissa's list of recommendations is perhaps the most comprehensive we've ever received from a host with many pages of excellent tips and favourites. I'm just sorry we weren't in Austin long enough to try them all. "
,,,,,,,,Excellent place to stay!! Close to Austins best stuff and a great location to grab a rental bike or bus to journey a little further!!
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I traveled to Austin for a long weekend getaway and the Urban Cottage was the perfect place to stay! Melissa and Dave were very welcoming, and all communication and planning with Melissa was absolutely seamless. The cottage was exactly as advertised. It was clean, cozy and comfortable! The cottage was in a safe and fairly central location, walkable to most places within the Austin area. Melissa and Dave were very willing to accommodate and provided a great list of recommended restaurants and bars in the area. I would highly recommend the Urban Cottage for your next trip to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect and as described. Melissa was an excellent host and even provided a printout of some great places to eat on the east side (best side!) of Austin. LOTS of stuff within walking distance and the cottage was absolutely charming.
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Melissa and Dave's cottage. It felt bigger than the photos and was very clean and welcoming. The bed was soft and comfy and the shower had great pressure and lasting hot water.  They were very thoughtful in the details, including refreshments in the fridge as well as coffee, tea, and oatmeal, and small amenities you might need such as a hair dryer and iron.

Melissa was very responsive throughout the entire process and allowed us to check-in a few hours early after our flight once the place was ready.  The location was easy walking distance from many great restaurants and nightlife including 6th St and Rainey St, but also provided the neighborhood feel of living like a local.  We would absolutely recommend staying at this location for anyone's visit to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I stayed at the Urban Cottage for a long weekend in Austin and had a blast! Melissa was a wonderful host even though we didn't get the chance to meet in person.  All communication was seamless, the cottage was very clean and there were even some great refreshments, coffee and tea for us upon our arrival.  Melissa even extended checkout on our last day as we had a late flight out of Austin giving us a chance to freshen up before heading home.  The location is great to access all of what East Austin has to offer (food, bars, music, dancing, etc.) and is very walkable or a quick bike ride to downtown, SOCO and the capitol building. I would definitely recommend Melissa's Urban Cottage as it makes you feel like a local and less like a tourist. "
,,,,,,,,"BEAUTIFUL.
MELISSA & DAVE WERE THE NICEST HOSTS..!!!
THEIR HOME IS SOO BEAUTIFUL.
IT FELT LIKE WE HAD OUR OWN PRIVATE LITTLE RANCH COTTAGE.
SO CLEAN & MAINTAINED.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS SOO COOL TOO. 
WALKING DISTANCE TO ALL THE COOL THINGS AUSTIN HAS TO OFFER. 
THE COTTAGE HAD EVERYTHING ANYONE COULD EVER ASK FOR. 
I WANTED TO STAY LONGER BECAUSE IT FELT SOO MUCH LIKE BEING AT HOME.
I DEFINITELY WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN ON MY NEXT VISIT TO AUSTIN.

"
,,,,,,,,Very friendly and accommodating hosts. My stay was easy and hassle free from start to finish. The cottage was beautifully prepared and a great place to stay. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was so lovely - a quiet, stylish haven in a very cool part of town. I really enjoyed exploring a new part of Austin (to me) from here. I was working in town all week and the cottage made for a welcome break from my hotel room norm. Melissa was a perfect host, even being so kind as to help me with sending items I left behind. I will definitely be back to stay at this gem of a spot! Thanks Melissa!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at this cute as a button little cottage! It was clean , the bed was super comfy and the linens were great. The kitchen had everything we needed, even some cold drinks waiting for us!
It is a short walk from lots of great food and entertainment and Melissa and Dave were great hosts. I can't imagine a better place to stay in Austin. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"The Urban Cottage is by far my favorite place to stay in Austin! Melissa's instructions were easy to follow, she was super responsive, and the cottage was cozy and clean.  Car2Go was almost always close by when I needed to get around Austin, but the location is still super accessible. I highly recommend this spot and will be eager to book again!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's cottage was perfect for a long weekend in Austin. It's within walking distance of Downtown and right in the middle of the many excellent bars and restaurants in East Austin, while feeling removed from any bustle or noise. Wi-Fi works well, the cottage is clean and secure -- just a great stay, overall."
,,,,,,,,"The urban cottage is amazing! It is a gem in the trendy east area of Austin and so close to downtown and the famous 6th street. As soon as we arrived at the cottage we fell in love, it is so homely and private. All the little touches left by Melissa including extra heaters due to the unusually cold weather, to the welcome note, small snacks and drinks and also a guide to surrounding spots and attractions made our stay at the cottage truly special. We can't wait to come back and stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Melissa & Dave's cottage was adorable and perfect for our long weekend in Austin. It was clean, welcoming, bright, and a short drive to much of what Austin has to offer. (The map shows the listing West of 35, but it's actually East.) Melissa replied to all of my texts promptly and was happy to lend us an iron. The bedroom was bright on sunny mornings, so, if you like to sleep in, I'd bring a sleep mask. We will definitely stay here when we return to Austin!  (Even our Austin residing friend was impressed!)"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was just as expected when I arrived. The cottage was welcoming, located just at the the back of the owners' house.

It is nicely located at walking distance from downtown."
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a great experience here. Melissa and Dave were terrific hosts, and I enjoyed this neighborhood. The cottage was very comfortable and within walking distance of cool restaurants. The recommendations on the table when we walked in were appreciated. We would highly recommend the cottage!"
,,,,,,,,"This cottage backs up to a nice back entrance option alley that gives you a feel of easy access and privacy. Very fun pivot point in the city considering the number of off beat spots to check out in the adjacent neighborhoods. Austin water and freshly ground coffee stocked the fridge and entry was a breeze. My sister and I had a blast exploring Austin's limits from this homey little cottage that has all appliances a traveler may need. Thanks Melissa, we had a great visit and enjoyed our stay! "
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I had a really nice stay at this charming cabin. The space is really great. Very clean and comfortable. Melissa was a very attentive host who was more than happy to offer recommendations and very attentive to any requests we made. Whether they were pressing or not.

The cottage is in a cute area (if not the fanciest) that's pretty close to downtown and has several nice restaurants, cafes, and shops a few blocks away. It was also great to be near a bike share station, plenty of public transit, and Franklin BBQ!

I would happily stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Melissa & Dave's cottage was absolutely fantastic!  I wish I could have stayed longer.  Everything about it is comfortable and just like the photos shown.  Getting downtown was simple... Just a $5 Uber ride. Next time I'm in Austin I hope I can stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"We had a blast staying at Melissa and Dave's cottage. The place was just as it appeared in the pictures and we always looked forward to going back to the place at night after being out and about.  Very cozy, well-designed, nice bathroom, and comfy, quiet bedroom. One of the best parts was exploring the neighborhood, which has a bunch of cool new restaurants and some old establishments as well. It was also walkable to downtown which was really convenient. Great spot, we'll be back next time we visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was so wonderful and felt like home away from home. It was clean, good location and a great place to come back to each night. The owners seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a nice stay in Austin. Would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"I loved the convenience and charm of the place.  The hosts were incredibly accommodating and gracious.  This was my first Airbnb experience and, in the future, will attempt to avoid hotels altogether as a result.  We were greeted with a nice handwritten note welcoming us to the cottage as well as quaint amenities such as mineral water and coffee. The inside of the cottage was in great condition and kept very clean tidy.  The cottage is also within a short walk of downtown which was especially convenient for our trip.  My expectations of the stay were either met or exceeded in every instance."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Melissa and Dave's cottage for a week for the US GP. It was a fantastic place. As people described, very clean and comfortable. The location was also fantastic with only a short 10 minute walk to down town/6th street, and plenty of places to eat up on 11th. Melissa and Dave were fabulous hosts and gave great recommendations on things to do and places to eat. They even left some gorgeous coffee, porridge for breakfast and some lovely sparkling water. 
I had a fantastic experience...thanks so much Melissa and Dave! "
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's cottage was great. Perfect location for traveling by foot or by car. Very clean, two air conditioners and just really cute. It was 4 of us staying there and it never felt too cramped. Melissa was responsive (both prior to travel and during our stay) and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin. Highlight: 3-4 blocks to Franklin BBQ."
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was exactly as advertised, well located and charming.  Melissa was extremely accommodating and responsive.  Had no issues with the cottage and would be happy to stay here again in the future."
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was great and we felt welcomed from the start.   By far, my best airbnb experience.  Austin is a great city and staying here was one of the best ways to experience it. "
,,,,,,,,We stayed here for the ACL and found the cottage warm and convenient. The accommodations was good for the three of us and enjoyed the clean space. We definitely recommend this cottage and the location was great!  
,,,,,,,,We couldn't have been happier with the cottage. It was in a great neighborhood within near some great bars and restaurants on the east side and a quick stroll from downtown. Melissa left us an extremely helpful list of recommendations of things to do both near the cottage and in other parts of the city that we used daily. The cottage itself was nice and clean with all the necessities and a nice little porch to sip our morning coffee on. Would absolutely stay here the next time we visit Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying at Melissa's place, so much so we didn't want leave! Check in was a breeze, and the cottage was really comfortable with everything we needed. It was located within 20 mins walk of the Capitol, and restaurants were even closer. We'd definitely recommend this property."
,,,,,,,,"Melissa was a fantastic host. My parents were a part of the booking and the whole trip couldn't have been better. Perfectly located, lovely and helpful host who was happy to answer any questions and give useful advice. There was no trouble finding the cottage and the facilities were exactly what we were after.
Couldn't be better."
,,,,,,,,"The cottage is in a great location, in a private and quiet garden. Inside is light, airy, spotlessly clean and with great aircon. We had a great time in Austin. Melissa and Dave were very friendly hosts. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"The hosts were very welcoming, leaving us with a kind note, some water and coffee stash in the fridge. They kindly also provided us a with a 'pack n play' bed for our small child. We arrived late at night and they had the place well lit up and it was easy and convenient getting in.
Lovely neighborhood, cyclable distance to downtown and to the hip night scene.
The location however provided by Airbnb on the map was rather inaccurate  - it shows the cottage a few blocks closer to downtown than it actually is, and on the other side of the freeway. That's not really a problem in reality, though it is rather misleading."
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was the perfect place to spend 3 days in Austin. The location is perfect - walking distance to amazing food and bars and a short driving distance away from all of the best things Austin has to offer. The cottage was incredibly charming, with beautiful light and modern charm. Melissa and Dave left us Topo Chico, Mexican Coke and delicious coffee in the fridge and a welcoming note with tips on the best of Austin. We also loved sitting on the porch of the cottage, having a glass of wine and admiring the live oaks. Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"We arrived on a sweltering summer night, and Melissa and David made us feel immediately at home with ice cold beverages waiting for us in the fridge and personal recommendations of where we could get a good late night dinner.  The cottage was clean and charming, had strong A/C, and a super comfy bed + linens.  The location can't be beat: tucked away on a quiet, tree-lined street that's just a 5-10 min walk away from the 6th St. food trucks, restaurants, bars, and shops.  "
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent time staying at Melissa's. It was in an ideal spot, just out of the way of the downtown hustle and bustle, yet still a short walk to a myriad of awesome food spots, especially East Austin food trucks and cafÃ©s.
The small cottage was exactly as pictured, simple and stylishly decorated, and just large enough for a couple and perhaps a few friends.
We never met Melissa in person but she was careful to keep us in the loop for our arrival and was quick to offer any help might need. She even left a homemade informational booklet with many personal tips and suggestions as to local bars, restaurants and other interesting spots to check out.
Couldn't have asked for more from Melissa or her pad and would love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"I was in Austin for work and rented the cottage through the week. Location of the cottage is ideal. Quiet residential neighborhood in downtown area. Neat and clean with good beddings. Excellent host, went out of the way to make my stay comfortable. Would highly recommend this place.
This was my first airbnb stay and was surely a memorable one. 

~ Mandeep"
,,,,,,,,"This lovely, very clean, and comfortable urban cottage is ideally located in Austin, just moments from downtown, IH-35, and the airport. Despite being so close to everything, the cottage and neighborhood is quiet and peaceful - all in all, the best of both worlds! We rented a car and really appreciated the extremely easy on-street parking situation. Communicating with the host was easy and she was so quick to respond to my queries. It's obvious that Melissa and Dave love Austin and love their cottage, and enjoy sharing these things with visitors!"
,,,,,,,,My sister and I stayed in the cottage for 3 nights on a road trip. We loved it! Everything was very clean and the cottage is so charming. It's also perfectly located near all the restaurants I wanted to try. We had a great time and would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay in Melissa's cottage! We really enjoyed how close it was to everywhere we wanted to visit.  The cottage itself was cozy, quiet, and SO clean! Really enjoyed the extra treats in the fridge too :)"
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin. Walking distance to the action of downtown but far enough away for some peace and quiet.
Would definitely stay again if I'm ever back there."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience with airbnb and my expectations were defiantly exceeded.  Melissa was an excellent host right from the beginning with quick and informative responses.  Although I never actually met her on my trip (my cousin was able to) she could be easily reached by text or phone at any time.  I spent 5 nights in the cottage and it was exactly as the pictures depicted and most importantly clean!  Access was easy with the code system. The location was perfect.  Although we didn't have a car, Melissa provides an overnight parking pass which is perfect for those who do.  We made use of the B- cycles which were a short walk away.  Lyft is also a great way to get around.  But really, you can walk most anywhere.  Unfortunately Franklins was closed when we were there, it was right down the street.  Will have to come back for that!  All in all we had a fabulous time and would defiantly be back."
,,,,,,,,"This was my favorite place out of many as I've been traveling across the country. It's quiet and cozy. It's clean. It's decorated well. There's a front porch. It's a fantastic urban cottage. 

There's plenty of stuff you can walk to in the area, either north to e. 11th or south to e. 6th. Good restaurant and bars, nothing like the other side of e. 6th (dirty 6th). There's great BBQ really close (Franklins', Micklethwait). There are several yoga studios. The streets are quiet. It was five star location to me.

Parking is a breeze out front, so getting in your car and exploring is easy too.

Would definitely recommend."
,,,,,,,,"The Urban Cottage looked just as it was featured on the airbnb website. The furnishings were adorable. My friends and I could not get over how CLEAN everything was. Melissa and Dave left a lovely note for us when we arrived. The refrigerator was full of beverages and the basket on the counter held oatmeal, tea, etc. We enjoyed having breakfast in the cottage every morning before starting our day. We also really appreciated the pans/plates/cups/etc. available for making breakfast. My friends and I were well rested and comfortable each morning when we awoke - the bedroom is comfortable and cozy and the pull out couch was easy to pull out and put back together again. Melissa's tips for restaurants around Austin were fantastic! The cottage was within walking distance to most of the sites we wanted to see and a very short cab ride to others that were further away (ie Barton Springs/Baylor St. art wall). We had such a great time and I would absolutely recommend the Urban Cottage to anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved the cottage and Melissa was the perfect host. She not only brought over lawn chairs for us to brave the Franklin's BBQ line, she also offered to mail is our phone charger that we left. The house is the perfect combo of modern and charm. The location was perfectly nestled in the middle of all the best restaurants and bars and parking is easy... I definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great cottage/guest house that Melissa and Dave have. The place was very clean and has lots of privacy. It was walking distance to all the restaurants, coffee, and bars on the east side. The two air conditioning units were huge. The walkway from the front gate to the back house can be a bit dark and they do have lights along the path. Melissa was very attentive and easily reached via emails/texts. My wife and I had a great stay here and will look to come back again for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"I came to Austin for a conference at the convention center; and though I love downtown grandeur, I enjoy residing in the neighborhoods and patronizing smaller , local restaurants.  This cottage was perfectly situated between both 7th and 11th street, which have amazing small eats.  And getting down to the conference center was so easy with the B-Cycles!  The ride was flat and I could get there within 5 minutes.

The cottage itself was exceptional, especially with the great A/C and a fridge with cool drinks.  Couldn't ask for anything more than a place like this to relax and recharge while I got my urban adventuring on!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a fabulous stay at Melissa and Daveâ€™s Urban Cottage in Austin.  The cottage is tucked in behind their beautiful 1940s bungalow on a quiet street in east Austin.  The cottageâ€™s placement in relation to their house allows for just the right mix of privacy and proximity.  They have a sweet little tomato and greens garden near the cottageâ€™s porchâ€”this was a lovely sight in the early morning.  The cottage was very clean (and I am quite particular about this!).  I settled right in, welcomed by a nice note from Melissa and Dave and a Smeg refrigerator stocked with mineral water.  The space is so tastefulâ€”streamlined, not cluttered or overly-decorated, but also extremely inviting.  The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, utensils, and cooking ware.  The window air conditioning units quickly cooled whichever room I was in (I just used one at a time and closed off of the other rooms during the hottest parts of the day).  I slept well in the nice-sized bedroom, and enjoyed some relaxation time during the day in the living room.  I was in town for a conference at the Hilton and welcomed the quiet space away from downtown.  The street is beautiful and quiet, but also within easy walking distance to some of the best spots in Austin.  My only regret is that I didnâ€™t have more time to explore east Austin, or just enjoy the quiet cottage time. Melissa and Dave are wonderful hosts!"
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was exactly as described. All was excellent. It was a absolutely positive and uncomplicated experience. Melissa and Dave are great hosts. They provided valuable information about Austin. The area is close to everything, yet quiet and peaceful. I can not recommend the urban cottage more!

Melissa and Dave,thanks so much for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"My traveling companion and I were utterly delighted with this charming, super-comfortable,  well-equipped cottage. It's located in a convenient, up-and-coming, hip, but peaceful, neighborhood within walking distance to downtown attractions, but away from the bustle.   We especially loved hanging out on the great porch in a quiet, leafy yard.   The digital combination lock is a great plus, and the bathtub/shower has superb water pressure.
 Melissa's an ideal host, thoroughly organized, informative, and helpful. All-in-all a winner choice for a visit to seductive Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I spent 5 nights at Melissa and Daveâ€™s cottage and we absolutely loved it! The only downside was that we didnâ€™t have more time or weâ€™d have stayed longer!
Itâ€™s exactly as described and totally immaculate. Lots of natural light, the showerâ€™s great (especially after spending 1 month in Mexico), the wifiâ€™s perfect and you get heaps of privacy. I didnâ€™t get a chance to meet Melissa in real life unfortunately (though we met Dave a couple of times who was lovely and very accommodating) but she was very responsive via text whenever we needed to speak with her and always willing to help however she could.
We were given a parking pass and a list of really good local recommendations that were left on the dining table, which was such a nice touch!
Iâ€™d definitely recommend staying at this place, itâ€™s within walking distance of a tonne of great stuff and has absolutely everything youâ€™d need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in Austin.
Oh yeah, and the bedâ€™s super comfortable!
Thanks Melissa and Dave for having us, wish we could have stayed 4evs!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed a week at Melissa and Dave's cottage and it was everything I hoped for and more! Clean space, quiet neighborhood, lots of privacy, perfectly set up kitchen, fast wifi, strong AC units and walking distance to tons of restaurants, bars and music venues. They made sure we had everything we needed, supplying us with loads of recommendations and coffee and oatmeal for the first morning, checking in with us, but always super respectful of our privacy and space.  Even though they were out of town for part of the weekend, they made themselves completely available to anything that arose. They are lovely hosts, and I was sad to leave the little cottage."
,,,,,,,,"Stayed here with two friends for a long weekend in Austin and had an incredible time! The cottage is adorable and I would absolutely recommend it. We traveled mostly by car (or cab on nights with no designated driver) - though there are great places to go within walking distance (as soon as we arrived we threw our bags down and walked around the corner for delicious outdoor drinks at Takoba). Melissa and Dave are wonderful, and gave us lots of great recommendations (in addition to the packet of neighborhood favorites already in the cottage) when we ran into them during our stay. Hope to return soon!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa and Dave's cottage was absolutely perfect! It was comfortable, quite and served our needs perfectly. The description on airbnb is 100% accurate and our stay there could not have been better!"
,,,,,,,,"Adorable place! 

LOCATION: Great. Easy parking (Melissa provides parking pass). Two blocks from Franklin BBQ and lots of other good restaurants. Quite street in the up-and-coming East Side neighborhood. Lovely woody-suburban setting. Surprisingly private for being in someone's backyard.

ACCOMMODATIONS: Nice porch for enjoying morning coffee with the birds chirping. Spacious interior with all the essentials. Comfy couch, little breakfast table. Well outfitted kitchen with complementary coffee, tea, and instant oatmeal. Nice simple bathroom with hair drier. Walk-through closet goes from livingroom/kitchen to bedroom. Bedroom has lovely open ceilings and clean airy feel. Tasteful minimalist-retro decor throughout. Very clean. No clutter.Two window A/Cs keep the place at a comfortable temp. 

HOST: Melissa was super responsive throughout the booking process and my stay. Turns out we have some (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) friends in common and we went out for a drink one night to swap stories. 

BOTTOM LINE: Couldn't have been better!"
,,,,,,,,"I booked Melissa's cottage for my partner's parents who were visiting Austin for the first time from Seattle.  Melissa lives just a few blocks from me, and her cottage was the perfect spot to house our out-of-town guests.  They were very happy with the accommodations and found themselves lingering on the front porch enjoying the sunshine on several occasions.  The cottage is beautifully appointed, clean, and comfortable and in a great part of town.  I hope to book with Melissa again in the future.
Thanks AirBnB for introducing me to a wonderful neighbor!"
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I had a lovely week-long stay at this cute urban cottage. The description and pics were right on and the location was super convenient (walkable) for our conference near the convention center. Melissa was a breeze to communicate with prior to our visit, checked in on us to be sure we had all we needed during our stay, and left us some lovely refreshments. "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed one week at this lovely cottage with my husband and really enjoyed it! We were also really happy to meet with Melissa and Dave. The cottage is quite large, airy, with a nice porch. One of the most important things for me while staying at rentals is the bathroom and I was very happy with the cottage's bathroom - it was very clean, new, appropriately sized and easy to use without any problem with hot/cold water. Another priority is the location and after spending 1 week in lovely Austin, we cannot think of a better location. East Austin speaks for itself and the cottage was within walking distance to great bars, restaurants and food trucks. It is also very close to downtown - we always walked there. If you prefer public transport, there are 2 lines nearby. There is also a Zipcar location again within a short walking distance. If you have a car, the cottage comes with a parking pass. We definitely loved the city, the neighborhood, the cottage and our great hosts Melissa and Dave. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Melissa & Dave were great hosts! So hospitable from before we arrived until we got back home. 

The cottage was modern and cozy with personal touches (like a note to us and refreshing beverages)

Location was amazing and all the printed recommendations Melissa gave to us were really delicious with great ambiances!

If you are going to Austin I would definitely recommend staying at the cottage."
,,,,,,,,"This was amazing. You have the entire guest house to yourself, so it's very private and very comfortable. Melissa also wrote a very sweet note to us to welcome us, and provided an incredibly detailed packet (and brochures!) about any local restaurants, activities, or general things we might want to know about Austin. She also had the fridge stocked with granola and greek yogurt, which was perfect for us (it was great to have snacks already on hand). She checked in to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and was quick to respond to any questions we might have. The location is also incredible- such a short walk to downtown! We had an amazing trip and I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"We had such a great time, the guys are so lovely and the cottage is gorgeous. Had everything we needed and was a close short walk to the city. We loved it! "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here for SXSW (the Interactive portion of the festival) this year and it was perfect. Walking distance from downtown, but secluded and quiet enough to get a good night's sleep. Great hosts and a great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely loved Melissa's cottage! Great location in East Austin, a block away from Franklin's and such an adorable space. Super easy to contact and communicate with, Melissa was a terrific host and I've only raved about her cottage to any and all of my friends planning to take a trip to Austin. I most definitely will be back! "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at this cottage was just absolutely perfect. Melissa was an excellent host and she went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. I'm definitely planning on staying here again when I go back to Austin to visit, and I will gladly recommend this lovely cottage to all of my friends. Thanks again, Melissa! :) "
,,,,,,,,"Melissa and Dave were welcoming and warm from the moment my little family arrived.  They made sure that we had everything we needed, including enough space heaters to make their beautiful cottage very cozy.  They even were accommodating with our changed plans and travel needs with a toddler.  I got a copy of the ""guide"" book they are putting together for guests, and after trying a few of their recommendations, I would say trust them to know Austin!  Thank you both for making our first real family vacation memorable.  "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing! Melissa and Dave were great and the guesthouse in the back (where we stayed) was beautiful. Simple, but everything you would need. We had a rental car and they had a visitor street parking pass so that wasn't a problem. My main reason for booking was that I have a lot of food restrictions and wanted to be able to cook some meals while there. They were so accommodating and let us borrow any cooking/ baking dishes that weren't in the guesthouse but that they had in their home. Austin was surprisingly cold when we were there but all the heaters they had in there kept us warm. And they were great with any questions about the area. Walkable to 6th street, Rainey street (bit further), and downtown attractions/ venues/ bars. Overall, fantastic, and I would totally recommend it to others!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa and Dave have a beautiful cottage in Austin that is walking distance to both east 6th Street and downtown. At the same time it's in a quiet neighborhood which is great for a retreat.

Melissa is also very responsive with requests - she was thoughtful to leave us space heaters when we visited in December - didn't think Austin for that cold but glad we had the heaters. The cottage is minimalistic and quaint - highly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience staying at Melissa's great cottage.  It's well located in East Austin, which has a lot of cool places to go to eat and drink, and an easy walk to downtown.  The cottage was adorable, and Melissa left us a nice note , a parking permit for our car, and some coffee / breakfast items, and a few Austin guides to greet us.  The bed was super comfy and, while it was a bit chilly, Melissa provided us with enough space heaters to keep the place warm.  We were in Austin for a long weekend, and would definitely stay here again if we return.  Thanks Melissa!"
,,,,,,,,"Melissa's cottage was a great place to stay!  It was just as advertised, but maybe MORE charming.  The location was super convenient, the cottage was well-appointed, and our hosts were friendly and helpful.  We arrived in the midst of a cold snap, but Melissa and Dave were armed with extra blankets and space heaters that kept the place cozy and comfortable.  I can't wait for a return visit when the weather is warm! Highly recommended.     "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place in a great location. The yard surrounding the cottage is very pleasant, and everything was clean. Definitely would consider returning. "
,,,,,,,,"Such a lovely space, from the moment we walked we fell in love. So much so that we decided we had to go back and stay for an extra couple days while we were in Austin. A true home away from home, bright, airy and peaceful. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there. 
We also discovered some wonderful Restaurants/shops just a few blocks north of the cottage on east 11th, in particular we enjoyed Quickie Pickie, Hillside Pharmacy, Take Heart, & Rosewood collective. Melissa and Dave were such gracious hosts as well, everything down from the ease of communication to the discovering of delicious treats in the fridge. Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"Lovely place to stay and even lovelier hosts!  The cottage is very charming and has everything you need.  We appreciated the luxurious towels, Mrs. Meyer's soap, and stocked refrigerator.    The cottage is within walking distance of great eateries and attractions.  We were in town for the Formula 1 race weekend and were easily able to walk to the convention center and hop on a shuttle to the track.  It was nice to have our own private place but to have such helpful and friendly hosts nearby.  Definitely plan on staying here for future Austin trips!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed with Melissa and her husband for Fun Fun Fun Fest weekend.  Both were helpful with information about the area and were very polite about checking in our us during our stay to make sure we were comfortable.  The unit is private, cozy, well furnished, and the kitchenette came in handy!  It was an easy walk to downtown, some great East Austin cafe and bars, and the house is ""smelling distance"" from Franklin's BBQ.  We really enjoyed our stay!"
,,,,,,,,"A really nice little spot that was a nice short walk from downtown and E. 6th street with bars and food trucks. Very enjoyable and clean interior for relaxing, reading a book, or having a cup of tea. Start your morning with a cup of coffee on the porch. And a great couple of accommodating hosts as well. "
12223667,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Amazing location.  You can hear the bands from 6th St bars from the balcony. 
,,,,,,,,"The location was better than I could have hoped for. We were within walking distance of nearly everything Downtown Austin has to offer, and the space was as-described, fun, and clean."
,,,,,,,,"Top Trip is a top notch group of people. I so appreciate their promptness in responding to my inquiries, flexibility in our arrival time, and general assistance regarding our accommodation. Cara, Sandra, and the rest of the crew helped make our stay in Austin ideal. 

This loft is located in the heart of 6th Street in Downtown Austin - within walking distance of everything that makes that area desirable. Restaurants, bars, live music all close enough to enjoy and far enough away to have a quiet night's sleep. 

With the place itself, what you see is what you get: simple, neat, clean, and functional. The service has us confident we'll always have a go-to place when visiting Austin in the future.

Thanks again Top Trip team!"
,,,,,,,,Great value with room to work and play on 6th Street!  Cara did a great job setting up this last minute stay.  We will definitely be back! 
,,,,,,,,"Top Trip Rentals was fantastic. Great communication, clean apartment, and everything they communicated in the listing and in their emails was as expected. 

The unit itself was very nice, but how you view it will depend on your group, as all of the beds are on an open second level with a single bathroom, so there's little in-room privacy. A family or 3 close friends should find it very comfortable, but other groups needing areas of privacy should take the layout into consideration. 

The location is great, but it is on 6th, so nighttime noise is there. The unit has sound dampening windows/doors and a noise maker to drown out the  music from the bars, but while I found it just fine, those requiring perfect silence at night to sleep will want to look elsewhere.

Overall, I had a great stay and I'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location. Enjoyed our trip!"
,,,,,,,,"The property was exactly as described, and the proximity to 6th street cannot be beat. Gaining access to the apartment was a breeze, and all codes provided worked without any problems."
,,,,,,,,Great apartment.  Cool space. Loved the cement floors.  Plenty of room.  Nicely appointed kitchen and the towels were clean and fluffy.  Bright and cheerful.  On site staff was helpful.  Would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Everything was just perfect. From arrival, to the Automated check-in, to the pre-arrival experience. The place is incredible with everything you need in fantastic location. Def found my home away from home in ATX."
,,,,,,,,Fantastic from the moment we arrived. Only place I will stay in Austin going forward!
,,,,,,,,"Location is perfect!! If you're looking for a conveniently located and affordably priced loft for you and your friends, book this loft with Top Trip Rentals! Chereen, our host, was very accommodating as issues popped up. The loft is a tad smaller than what I had expected; but still plenty of room for a group of 5 guys. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect! Everything was so great and easy even with it be a last minute booking. Highly suggested when staying in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Accommodation was very nice and clean. My colleagues were satisfied.
14787102,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Greatest experience in more ways than one. They were amazing hosts and the place was so beautiful! They are very helpful with information on Austin and places to go! Also very close distance to downtown! Very friendly, and any time I plan on going to Austin this will be my go to! "
,,,,,,,,Very helpful and considerate host. Great location for either South Congress area or DT. Nice balcony view of the city 
,,,,,,,,Derek was an excellent host. I was in town for a conference and accidentally booked my hotel for the following week; there weren't any other hotel options available. He accepted my request within minutes of booking. He went out of his way to offer to get me stuff from the store on my day of arrival and drive me places throughout my stay.
,,,,,,,,Beautiful apartment!
,,,,,,,,"Derrick was a fantastic host! We had a very short trip and didnt get to spend much time with Derrick or his fiance, but they were very welcoming nonetheless. They were flexible and gracious with us as our arrival time got pushed back much later than expected. "
11455670,4.5,10,9,10,10,9,9,"This was the perfect place for a girls weekend. Close to everything, clean and beautiful. LeAnn was great to work with as well and I would definitely use this again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience in this beautiful apartment was wonderful!  It was exactly as described in the pictures.  Very clean and loved the way it was decorated.  LeeAnn was an excellent host.  Very well organized and always available.  Would definitely stay here again.
Thank you LeeAnn for everything!   "
,,,,,,,,"Really beautiful apartment in a great location!  I was very comfortable, would happily stay again."
,,,,,,,,This place was awesome!
,,,,,,,,"This is the perfect location for a visit to Austin.  Free covered parking, secured access, beautiful view of the river, awesome pool, beautiful interior.  We were close (within 5 mins) from everything - parks, waterways, shopping, eating, downtown and Rainey Street.  We will be staying here again.  An amazing value."
,,,,,,,,"From the beginning, I felt as if I were dreaming. When I first laid eyes on the picture thought - could this be?! FF2 walking in the door and feeling the sense of ""relief"". SPECTACULAR - MARVELOUS - BREATHTAKING. Not to mention the security and staff were second to none. 
Absolutely feel the level of service made up for a few hiccups along the way. I am so pleased to have had the time to spend - hope others get to live their very own dream here as well.   "
,,,,,,,,"Just about everything about this apartment was beyond what we expected!

It's a fully furnished apartment in a regular apartment building, so you do have to submit typical background check paperwork.  But with that, you get all the luxury apartment style amenities, including a locked parking garage.  All the residents we met were friendly.

It is, indeed, a luxury apartment, meaning, a comfortable, king size bed with extra pillows and blankets, great selection of interesting books, granite counter tops in the fully stocked kitchen (pots, pans, dinnerware, tupperware, knives, utensils, etc), brand new appliances, upscale furnishings, decorations and art all around, a huge bathroom with walk-in closet, and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Fiber TV with HBO and Starz on demand (when we were there) and DVR included!  There was even detergent and softener for the washer and dryer in the unit.

I was on a work trip and didn't get a chance to visit the gym or pool, but you get an RFID key that will get you into everything, and judging by the rest of the building, they were probably very nice!  We never actually met LeAnn, but she was always available by phone or email.  Checking in was easy, any time of night or day without contact.

The location was GREAT!  Quiet at night, right on the water, with a view of downtown over the river (i.e. Ladybird Lake), across the street from a great sushi bar and Tex-Mex/Asian Fusion restaurant in the Hyatt, as well as kayak and paddleboard rentals, and river boat tours.  Right next to the Long Center (one of Austin's largest performance venues) and Auditorium shores/Butler Park, not to mention the riverwalk. Walking distance from Downtown, South Congress... even Barton Springs and Zilker Park are accessible by foot (although that walk would be pushing it in the summer!).

The only down-side I can think of is the shower pressure was low because it's a LEED building, but the owner said she was looking into a new shower head designed for low pressure, so that may even be fixed!  Oh, and there was no cooking oil provided, so... cooking is BYOO ;)

Pro Tip: the TV in the living room is on an outlet controller by a light switch just outside the bedroom (that stumped us for the first day).

This is the perfect getaway in Austin for 2 people."
5489353,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Natalie and her home are super!  Her home is cozy, cheery, warm, affordable and in a wonderful location. You can walk to fabulous cafes, restaurants and shops and its an easy stroll to downtown, Lady Bird Lake, Zilker, etc.  The neighborhood is quiet and friendly with many beautiful historic homes.  Natalie herself is kind, prompt and personable.  The whole process for check in/out was super easy and even though Natalie was traveling, she made herself available for questions.  I had such an awesome stay, thank you so much Natalie!  I cannot recommend her home enough. Having lived in Austin previously, please know this neighborhood is one of the best in the city."
,,,,,,,,"Natalie's place is perfect for a quiet stay up in the middle of the hip Clarksville neighborhood. Close to great West Lynn spots like Cafe Medici, Josephine House, and Cipolina, as well as west 6th spots like Sweetish Hill Bakery, Clark's, and Ricardo's Antique Emporium. Natalie was real helpful and responsive. A+!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome, exactly as described on the listing and in a cute  neighborhood where we could walk anywhere we wanted to go. Natalie was super helpful, even checking up after we checked in and getting back to me quickly when I had a question about parking my car. This was my first time using Airbnb, but Natalie helped give me a positive experience and I'd love to stay at her place again the next time I'm in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful neighborhood to stay in - the condo met our needs and we really enjoyed our trip to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"From the time my reservation was accepted to the time I checked out everything went so smooth.  When my friend and I checked in we were greeted with a warm letter from the host.  She opened up her whole condo to us and made us feel at home.  We really loved the soaps and the heated floor in the bathroom.  The neighborhood is in a great location for the film festival we were attending in downtown.  Parking was great and the complex was very quiet and safe.  The beds were very comfy.  As working members of the film press the kitchen table gave us room to edit photos, video and plan our day.  Our stay was a 5 star stay and we will be staying again for future film festivals.      "
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Natalie's during ACL Weekend #2. Overall it was a great visit and we would absolutely visit Natalie again. Highlights:

1) Quiet neighborhood - very little outside noise, which is saying something when it's concert weekend.  Loved the trees and art in nearby yards. 

2) Great location - beyond the neighborhood, we were pleased that we could walk to both Zilker Park and downtown easily. There were also multiple restaurants, cafes, and bakeries nearby, as well as a Whole Foods. Natalie had great suggestions: highly recommend Sweetish and Caffe Medici for coffee and pastries. 

3) Clean home with charm - inside was exactly as pictured. Washer and dryer on premise was super helpful. We were impressed by the bookshelves (something for everyone) and N64 collection (Mario Kart should be in all Airbnb's). 

4) Messaging with Natalie - she was very helpful answering questions throughout the booking process, and made sure we got in okay/had everything we need. All around great host!

In short, this is a great spot for anyone wanting to be in a quiet neighborhood and be within walking distance of restaurants, downtown, and Zilker Park. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, clean place, exactly as advertised!"
,,,,,,,,Natalie's place was conveniently located for us. It was a perfect cute little condo just a few blocks away from cafes and the fun places to walk to.  We will definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Wonderful stay. Very cozy and and Natelie was great! Definitely coming again.
,,,,,,,,"Great condo with plenty of room. Natalie was very friendly and even though we never met, made sure our stay went very well. She left us a very detailed note welcoming us, made us cookies, and left us tour books for Austin. The guest passes to Pure Austin were a very great bonus considering how much a one day guest membership is. The condo was also in a very good location with restaurants in walking distance and downtown just a taxi ride away, but also secluded enough to be quiet at night. We would definitely recommend this condo for friends coming to Austin for the weekend!"
,,,,,,,,Natalie was an incredibly accommodating and flexible host. Her place is really cute and in a great Austin neighborhood that makes it easy to explore downtown. It's spacious and comfortable. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to explore Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Darling condo. We felt very welcome. Natalie left cookies for us and great literature regarding things to do in Austin. Location is perfect with lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location!  Close to downtown, yet quiet enough for a good night's rest.   

Apartment was clean and comfy.  "
,,,,,,,,"Natalie's place was great! It was immaculate, and had all the necessities to enjoy a weekend away from home. The neighborhood is adorable, and great to take a walk and roam into town (only about 15 minutes).  We didn't stay at the apartment that much, but to relax before a comedy show and used the netflix. It was great to have easy quick access. The only thing I'd say is bring ear plugs, as the neighbors above have what sounded like a young kid running up and down the floors in the early morning."
,,,,,,,,"Natalie was quick to respond and her condo was exactly as described. Very clean, comfortable, and quiet location close to downtown. I enjoyed the time I spent there. I wouldn't hesitate to book her place again for a trip."
,,,,,,,,"Natalie's place is so cute!  The condo complex is in the heart of craftsmen's homes.  West 9th is about a 5-10 min ride or 20 min walk to anything you need in downtown Austin.  It's about 3 blocks from a market, great cafe's, and dining options. 

The house is clean, quiet, and nicely decorated.  Natalie was a great host and responded quickly to anything we needed.  I would definitely book this place again. "
,,,,,,,,"Natalie's apartment is just as pictured.  It was very clean and cozy.  Definitely felt like home. It was well situated, walking distance to downtown and other popular areas. She  provided us with tons of Austin information.  I really appreciated her responsiveness and genuine interest in making our time in Austin special. "
,,,,,,,,"We spent some amazing days in Austin at Natalie's beautiful condo. The location is perfect, just some minutes by walk to some of the coolest restaurants and coffee shops and also super close to Downtown. 
The apartment is adorable, cozy and comfortable, and Natalie has been really welcoming and helpful on guiding us through the best spots in Austin. Truly recommended!!
"
,,,,,,,,"This place was a gem of a find for my week in Austin for SxSW! Well situated, the layout and decor was fabulous and the host Natalie went out of her way to make sure our stay was pleasant. She really went above and beyond to make sure we had amenities in the apartment that would make our stay enjoyable and that we had the lay of community so we could easily find restaurants, stores and more. I'd definitely stay here again! "
6995128,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,It was such a lovely place and we enjoyed the stay a lot! Collin was responsive and made the place super comfortable for us to feel at home. I would love to visit again if I can have a chance to come back to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Collin's place is tastefully decorated and has everything you'd need.  The location is central to all the must-see spots in the city and almost everything is walkable.
Collin was there to meet us on arrival with instructions and a map of the city with his recommendations to visit.

If we return to Austin, we'd be happy to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Collin was a fantastic host. He answered any questions I had in a timely manner. The complex was very quiet. The house was very clean and maintained well. It was a great location for ACL (25 min walk or grab a pedicab 1 block away). There are a lot of things to do in walking distance, so we were never bored. We spent a substantial amount of time on the balconies because the weather was so nice. I will definatly consider booking with Collin the next time I am in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here during a trip to attend a conference with a colleague. The apartment is located in a really convenient spot. It's only 15 minutes walk to the conference centre and within a few minutes walk of the SoCo area. The apartment itself is  a great space. It was clean and tidy, and very pleasent to return to each evening. Collin was always quick to reposed to queries and gave clear instructions about everything I needed. I will try to stay here if I visit Austin again. "
,,,,,,,,Collin was extremely accommodating prior to and throughout our stay.  His place was fabulous!  It was in a great location in the south congress neighborhood and a short walk to downtown.  We can't wait to come back! 
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome, great location, great VIBE more than anything! Extremely comfortable beds, clean, no complaints. If i come back to Austin i will definitely choose this place again! "
,,,,,,,,"Colin's place was perfect for my visit to Austin.  Centrally located, we had access to both downtown/conference center area as well as South Congress shopping/restaurant area.  The two bedrooms were well appointed and bathroom was great.  Wifi worked wonderfully.  Collin left us some sparkling water to make us feel at home, and the house had all the appointments we could want.  I'd stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great space and close to everything! We would definitely stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Amazing first experience during my first visit to Austin. Collin made the whole process, from booking to checking out, a breeze. I will come back to his place as it is chic, comfortable, and awesome location. Thanks Collin for being so accommodating. "
,,,,,,,,"The location was AWESOME and the apartment was in impeccable shape. Was perfect for the four of us and just a quick walk or extremely cheap uber to everywhere in the city. Collin was so helpful and accommodating and if/when I come back to Austin, I'll be sure to try and book this place again!"
,,,,,,,,Our experience at Collin's place was great. We came out for ACL and his place was located perfectly. Not too close to the madness and not too far. Collin was very easy to communicate with. The place had all the amenities needed and would recommend his place. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a 2-bedroom apartment in a complex with lots of trees, set back off South Congress.  It was secluded and quiet. The apartment is charming, decorated in an eclectic urban Texas style. Our host made us feel welcome with an annotated map of Austin and complimentary wine. We enjoyed it and would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"My cousin and I met Colin briefly when we checked in. He is very easy going  and a generous host. His space is comfortable and clean with a lot of charm. The location was great, we were able to walk downtown, to south congress street, and even to Barton Springs. Almost everywhere else in the city was a quick uber away. "
,,,,,,,,"Collin the host was extremely accommodating, as first time air bnb users we were unsure of what to expect when using air bnb but Collin made everything so easy with texting and calling whenever we needed anything or had a question. Upon arriving there was a piece of paper with instructions for wifi, how to work the Netflix, all the amenities in the house.
The location is absolutely amazing for visiting Austin Texas. So unbelievably close to the heart and fun of downtown but perfectly secluded as to not be disturbed by the hustle and bustle. With a gas station/Convienient store right next door and a liquor store across the street this is the perfect location for a family vacation or a weekend of getting together with friends. I would highly recommend renting Collins house to any of my friends or family visiting the lovely Austin Texas. "
3294395,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great apartment and great location!
,,,,,,,,"This place was great. Perfect location - convenient to walk to downtown, but away from some of the noise. As a planner, I loved that all of my questions were answered in the welcome packet and were easy to access during my stay. Would definitely stay here again when we return to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"This is the second of Brooke's properties we have stayed at. 80% of the time we spent at this unit was at the table shown in the picture - late into the night. The view is just great. The property is nice, but you will definitely get your exercise walking as it's at the top of a pretty steep hill and there are three levels in the condo. It's an older property but the unit is well appointed and in good shape.  Even if it weren't, I'd be back for the roof-deck view (it's a very big deck area). Very convenient to restaurants and downtown. Responsive and pleasant host. I'm keeping it in my ""favorites"" list."
,,,,,,,,"This Airbnb was perfect for me during my relaxing stay in Austin. It's in a great central location, super close to Whole Foods, shopping, the river trail and restaurants. It was safe and quiet and it had everything I needed. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience! From the first second we walked in, to the last sad look as we closed the door behind us to leave. The accommodations were super cozy and welcoming and Brooke was very easy to talk to! We will definitely be staying here again the next time we head back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Great location and very nice accommodations!
,,,,,,,,"I can't say enough great things about this spot. The location is amazing, so close to downtown, but tucked into a quiet area off of east 6th, I felt like we were in a tree house:) The rooftop deck has great views, and I personally was obsessed with the reading nook. Brooke was great and answered all my questions during the booking process, I will definitely try to stay here again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"Most important, the place was clean.  Everything was as described with no surprises.  Would definitely recommend using this listing."
,,,,,,,,"Was a good stay, everything we needed for our stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Only contact was through text and email - no voice or direct contact. The apartment was immaculate,high quality, secluded and private and only minutes away from downtown. Whole Foods one block away good for breakfast."
,,,,,,,,"Great space, great location, and well appointed!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great little condo! It was incredibly clean and comfortable. I chose it for the proximity to my office, but it's not too far of a walk into the busy part of downtown if that's what you're looking for. The neighborhood is quiet and felt very safe. I wish I'd had more time to stay and relax, because the multiple decks (especially the rooftop one) were really fantastic. I'll definitely be staying here again."
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful condo perfectly centrally located. Easy walking distance to Zilker, Town Lake, and flagship Whole Foods store. Well appointed, safe neighborhood, super comfy bed, and awesome view of downtown skyline from rooftop terrace. Brooke was great and easy to communicate with. Loved our stay, would definitely stay again if given the chance!! "
,,,,,,,,Brooke is to be commended. I was confused about several things with my travel plans changing a few times prior to checking in and she was very kind patient and helpful. I love this condo and have already rebooked! Thank you Brooke. 
,,,,,,,,"Easy access, clean spacious, and located in nice area close to West downtown.  Would be happy to stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my second time staying at the property and it was just as perfect as my first visit. I love the location, the amenities, and of course the rooftop view!"
,,,,,,,,Great location and the town home was immaculate.  Roof top deck has nice views and is great place to have morning breakfast or relax in the evenings.  Brooke was very responsive to any and all questions
,,,,,,,,Brooke is great! Check in was super easy and the location and condo were amazing! We could walk basically anywhere we wanted to go! I can't recommend it enough! 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was perfect. Plenty of space with awesome outdoor areas. The location was also accessible to all of Austin, with some charming restaurants and antique shops within walking distance. I would definitely recommend the apartment and plan to stay here again when visiting. "
,,,,,,,,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Brooke's condo. The place has an amazing view of downtown Austin's skyline and is super walkable. It's very spacious and updated--absolutely everything I could have asked for and more. 

Brooke was very helpful throughout my booking process as I wasn't sure which day i was going to leave. She was patient while I took time to decide on my dates and was very quick to respond to all of my questions. 

I would definitely recommend this listing to others and would plan to stay here again in the future if available."
,,,,,,,,"This condo was absolutely amazing!! It was in a great location, had a stunning view of downtown Austin, and had everything we possibly needed! It was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. If you visit Austin, I would definitely recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"Nice, private condo. Modern and clean. Convenient parking spot. Great location!"
,,,,,,,,"We had no issues finding the apartment, parking, coming to and from, as Brooke has made it very easy.  "
,,,,,,,,"Brooke was very responsive to my questions.  Instructions for accessing condo were very clear.  She was very responsive when we had a small snafu with the wi-fi password and resolved it very quickly on a Saturday evening.  The condo was great - decor, appliances were all very new and modern and everything was comfortable.  This is a great location, walking distance to plenty of restaurants and to downtown, two blocks from Whole Foods, easy access to highways for going further afield. We would definitely stay here again on future visits to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing little condo, perfect for a couple. Great rooftop views, very clean, nicely updated, close to amazing restaurants, 6th St. and much much more. High recommend this unit and would return."

,,,,,,,,"Donna and Elvia have an amazing apartment with a great location in Austin. They went above and beyond in every aspect of our stay (cleanliness, amenities, communication, etc.)

I could not have been happier with this experience! "
,,,,,,,,This is an excellent place to stay--great location in Austin; pleasant place; good hostess. I rate it BEST!
,,,,,,,,"Austin, TX...warm, sunny, welcoming and the weather is lovely too. Donna and Elvia were great hosts.  They shared their knowledge about the area, suggested things to do/see and told us the interesting history behind their delightful Airbnb.  They were very approachable and accomadating with all of our needs, which were not many as the place is clean and stocked with the necessities.  Clarksville is a lovely quiet neighborhood not far from downtown, UT, shopping and the ""Bat Bridge."" Uber is everywhere though my friend and I opted to walk to most locations then Uber ""home"" when it was late. Downtown is about a 45+ minute walk. But, in April...with the air still cool and the flowers starting to bloom, it was a walk in the park.  I would highly recommend this little Clarksville Airbnb to a traveler on business, a friend or a family member.  Thank you Donna and Elvia for sharing, so lovely to meet the two of you.

,,,,,,,,"This is such a great location, and a comfortable spot.  I would stay again here without thinking twice.  There is great food nearby, and you are walking distance to the riverfront trails."
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place!
,,,,,,,,"Lawrence's house is immaculate and the photos do not do it justice. Location was perfect for us as we were attending the BBQ festival across the road at the long center. There are plenty of restaurants and services within walking distance. It took us about 30 minutes to walk across the river into downtown. High speed WiFi was amazing and the washer and dryer were definitely appreciated as we've been traveling for a few weeks and not everywhere has them. 

However the only down side was the noise from the upstairs neighbor. Being on the bottom floor we expected some noise to come from above, but what we got was constant LOUD banging and creaking at all hours. Every night we were woken 3-4 times from 11pm through to 430am
After 430 it was constant until roughly 9am. We found that we had to go to bed after midnight and sleep until lunch time everyday so we could get sleep once she'd gone out in the morning. We come from a house with 10 people that includes children and consider ourselves heavy sleepers. 

I cannot stress enough that this was the only sour point. "
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely loved this place. I was here for the weekend, very quiet and there are food and conscience stores close by. A 10 minute walk to the local Alamo and a 15-20 minute walk to downtown Austin.
Lawrence had just installed (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Fibre which is a lovely. Fast internet and TV services
From the photos these don't do this unit justice, it's much more spacious and larger, comfortable and homely. Would love to have a place like this of my own.
Didn't use the kitchen but lots of space and there is a dining area that you can use too.
The shower room is lovely and there are washer and dryers here to use too.
Bed is very comfortable and Air Con is available which was needed in the October heat.

Had a few enquiries and got speedy replies from Lawrence, very helpful host!
Definitely hope to stay here again in the future if I am able!!
"
,,,,,,,,Very clean and a great location!  Everything was as described and the check in was simple with coded door lock.

The place is super cute and has everything one would need for an extended stay. "

,,,,,,,,"Lawrence's place is exactly as described. It's modern, quiet, and a great location near downtown. 

Lawrence communicates very well and often and check in was very easy.

The place was so clean and you'll love being able to cook, store leftovers or drinks in the fridge, watch TV or a game with Fiber, stream a movie over wifi, or better yet wash your clothes with the full size washer and dryer.

House rules are simple to follow too. I felt safe there and again, it was quiet. 

There was a ton of rain during my visit but the placed stayed dry the entire time. 

There is a bus stop right outside and ride sharing to downtown was about $8 to $10. I love to explore cities and his place definitely let me do that. I would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Clean! Safe. Great value! Awesome owner! I would do it again... and again!
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place, great location!  My go to place when I visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The host was great! I had to make a last minute reservation and he responded quickly. I was able to easily get checked in and had everything I needed for a great stay! 

The condo was spotless, brand new and beautiful. The few days I spent there felt like home. HIGHLY recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"This was our first time using Airbnb and Lawrence made it a great experience.  Our hotel got cancelled when we arrived in Austin so this was literally last minute for a week stay.  He responded to a request within minutes and explained the process via messaging before I booked.  

The condo is as described and as pictured.  (Note for parents: it has a concrete floor & only a shower, no tub)  It is centrally located in a safe and quiet area on the border of a residential neighborhood and a large park/event center.  A bus stop is literally out front (not noisy) if you prefer public transit, while a gravel driveway offers easy parking for a rental car (as compared to the Austin hotels which seem to all charge daily parking fees)  

Keypad access made for easy entry & exit without needing to swap keys.  A Nest thermostat was simple to control and maintained a good temperature otherwise.  The condo is a 1st floor unit surrounded by fencing & foliage so it is cool & dark (not a lot of light, if that matters to you but helps when it's 90+ outside)  

We did not use the full kitchen except for the refrigerator and sink, but everything seemed in working order and dinnerware & cooking utensils were available.  

The TV has plenty of channels & the wifi is blazing fast.  Austin has (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Fiber, which seems to have put pressure on Time Warner to kick up their speeds a notch.  This is the fastest wifi I have ever used (as tested by (URL HIDDEN) -- a plus for any business traveler or even just checking Yelp to figure out where to get BBQ next.  Speaking of food there are a handful of food trucks and restaurants within walking distance (blocks) and the famous ""Bat Bridge"" which you'll want to visit at dusk.  Everything else is a 5-15 minute drive.  Our entire vacation it seemed you could get anywhere from this condo within 10 minutes.  It's a great spot."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time staying at Lawrence's place in the Bouldin neighborhood. The apartment was stocked with amenities (fast wireless internet, full kitchen, washer/dryer, parking outside), brand new, and very clean, The location could not be better. I especially recommend taking a walk through the nearby Butler park across the river and into downtown  Austin; the views of the city are incredible. Lawrence was helpful and responsive, and checkin/checkout were flexible and easy.

I highly recommend this listing to anyone looking to visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Awesome condo, everything was awesome!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 150 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Private, quiet, well located, and comfortable. Was easy to rest well after several long days at a technology conference. "
,,,,,,,,"Pretty much the perfect Austin AirBnB experience.  Unparalleled location 4 min walk to Lady Bird lake, Palmer Events Center, Long Center.  Right on bus line with rent bikes a half block away.  Surrounded by the best food in the city (Elizabeth Street Cafe, Thai Fresh, Lenoir...).  Quick drive/bike ride/10-15 min walk to the favorite places in the city:  Barton Springs Pool, S Congress, S Lamar, downtown, Clarksville...  Great hosts who've equipped the place with new, high end appliances.  Thanks to Lawrence and family for the warm, friendly hospitality. "
,,,,,,,,"Lawrence was a great host!   He was very friendly.  We had several conversations. 
The pictures and description of the apartment/duplex was spot on.  I slept like a rock each night as I was very comfortable. Stayed for over a month. Enjoyed every minute of it. Great shower, washer and dryer, kitchen, everything!
The neighborhood was perfect for me. Easy access to downtown, Town Lake and the Hike and Bike Trail, restaurants, and some of the main hangout areas.  Great Place to stay. Bus stops near by if needed.



"
,,,,,,,,"It was a great place. Everything is new. The location is great. Really comfortable and the services are prime. Fast internet connection and good cable tv. 

Lawrence was a great host. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, excellent location. Well furnished. Lawrence was helpful whenever needed, but otherwise left me to myself. I do wish I had been made aware that owners (upstairs residents) were accompanied by five dogs, and coincident noise, when present (usually weekends). But all-in-all, a great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Lawrence is a great host. Always on hand to help out where needed and very facilitating for any request and highly responsive.  The property is in a fantastic location - 15 mins walk from the centre of town or 5 mins on the public bikes which are located 50 metres form the front door. The property is new and compact - has everything you need, very quiet in a really nice and safe neighbourhood. I stayed for 30 days and like it so much I'm staying for another 30 days. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is just about a perfect Airbnb spot. Comfortable, stylish, central to a great area of Austin. Lawrence was easy to correspond with and the place was clean and new. I'd love to stay again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment and Lawrence was a very accommodating host.
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here during SXSW.  It's hard to find great places downtown. I wanted to stay within walking distance & wanted a civilized, modern place to stay. This apt is recently renovated, modern and is separate Apt from the house above.  I'd recommend this AirBnB for SXSW. "
,,,,,,,,"Great stay at the duplex. Walking distance to ACL at Zilker Park. Our hosts were very responsive, helpful and flexible. "
762400,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Stan did a great job accommodating to our 8 guests. Beer and wine in the fridge was a nice gesture to welcome us. The house is very nice along with the neighborhood near downtown. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Stan was a wonderful and attentive host. Anytime I had a request or question he gave a quick response and was more than happy to accomdate our requests and meet our needs. Lovely, clean house in an adorable neighborhood. Would recommend to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"Stan did a great job welcoming my group of friends into his home. Not only was entry into the house smooth, he provided us with a bottle of wine and a great guide to the local area. The house itself was amazing: quiet, comfortable, cozy, and clean. The location was perfect: a short walk to whole foods, downtown, and ACL. I've come to Austin for three years in a row now, and this was by far the best house."
,,,,,,,,"Stan was very flexible regarding our early arrival and allowed us to drop off our bags so we could explore Austin without lugging them around. He welcomed us with a chilled bottle of wine and very detailed explanations of the house as well as the surrounding area. The home is located in a beautiful neighborhood and we felt very safe and comfortable during our stay. The home easily fit all eight of us and we thoroughly enjoyed the amazing bedding provided. We were able to walk to cafes, restaurants, bars and the area grocery store which saved us time and money since we didn't have a rental car. It is a great location for guests going to Austin City Limits and provides convenient access to the less-crowded MoPac pedestrian entrance. A strict rule regarding not being allowed outside past 10 pm was our only issue with the rental; we were not prepared for that and given the timing of the ACL festival it limited our ability to relax on the porch when we got home. Otherwise we highly recommend for groups that will not be out past 10 pm and want to enjoy a wonderful home!"
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood near restaurants, bars and grocery. With easy car access to more!
Stan was a wonderful host welcoming us with a bottle of chilled wine. His home is darling and easily accomadated all 8 of us. "
,,,,,,,,"Stan was very welcoming throughout, and provided everything promised. Available for questions the whole time, and very easy to work with."
,,,,,,,,"This house was perfect for our friends gathering. We said ""Wow"" when we walked in the door. It was even nicer and more spacious than the pictures revealed online and fit our need perfectly. Thanks Stan for helping us make this a special memory!"
,,,,,,,,"Stan's house was PERFECT for our weekend stay for my son's wedding.  It was located less than a mile from his place and spacious enough to be the gathering place for our extended family.  Having 3 full bathrooms was great (each with a dispenser with shampoo, conditioner and body wash).  The beds were very comfortable and the place was very clean.  The kitchen was huge and the screened in porch was also really nice except we didn't use it due to the heat.  Stan was very accommodating and even allowed me to get into the house a little early.  The only thing I would recommend is to be more specific in the description to say that there is 1 bedroom on the lower level with a separate bathroom right outside the door and 3 bedrooms upstairs, including the master bedroom.  I was thinking there were 2 bedrooms on the lower level.  This was not a problem, but had to do a little rethinking about where everyone would be sleeping.  Stan was a great host with a great house in a great location."
,,,,,,,,"Stan's house was absolutely perfect for our weekend in Austin! We were a group of about 8 - 10 girls and there was plenty of space for everyone. The downstairs is very open and the common space is perfect for relaxing and hanging out as a group (the screened-in porch was also a plus!). In addition, the kitchen is large enough to enjoy group meals. Stan provided a long list of activities, bars, restaurants and other recommendations to make our stay in Austin very enjoyable! I would recommend this house to anyone looking to travel with a group to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Great neighborhood and the house was exactly as pictured! It was the perfect amount of space for our group of 10 girls.  Stan was super responsive for questions. I can't thank him enough for how flexible he was with our group - he let us in early since some people arrived early in the morning and was willing to let us stick around slightly after check out.  I would absolutely recommend staying here! 
,,,,,,,,"The house is a gorgeous getaway and perfect for a large group! The rooms are spacious - just as pictured - and beds very comfortable. The bathrooms are clean and bright. And the common areas are airy, with a nice open-floor plan for socializing, and screened in back deck.

The location was tucked in a quiet and adorable neighborhood, walkable to many restaurants, a cute park, and a commercial area. And a very quick cab ride to downtown. 

Stan was extremely communicative and helpful - and had a nice bottle of wine waiting for us, with lots of suggestions for restaurants/bars and grocery stores. It was a wonderful stay!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Stan was a wonderful host. His home was great for our group, and Stan was responsive and helpful throughout the entire weekend. Would absolutely stay at this home again!"
,,,,,,,,"Our group of eight ladies had a wonderful time at Stan's place. He was super helpful in the days leading up to our visit, allowing us to arrive a few hours early based on our flight times, and even offered to let us stay until 3pm on the day we checked out. He even left a chilled bottle of wine as a welcome gift! The house was comfortable, extremely clean and well stocked. Next time I'm in Austin I definitely plan to stay at Stan's house again! Thank you for helping make my best friend's bachelorette party a blast!"
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful experience with Stan!  He let us know everything that was going on in the area and made us feel very welcome.  I would high recommend staying here.  It was in the perfect location and Stan was wonderful to work with. 
,,,,,,,,"Stan is a great host! Left us some super helpful info and recommendations for the city and neighborhood. A spacious house and relaxing back patio. We had such a fantastic time visiting Austin, and staying at Stan's home helped make that possible!"
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing time at Stan's house. Everything was exactly as described and was clean, spacious and welcoming. Also the recommendations Stan provided were great! Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Twin bunks where a little smaller than anticipated, they are child size not adult twin.
Other than that, the rooms where as described and the home very welcoming."
,,,,,,,,Stan was absolutely fantastic in preparing us and making us feel at home in Austin! we were there for the weekend with a group of 30-something women and Stan's home was perfect. It is spacious yet cozy and plenty of sleeping room for everyone. The kitchen was the perfect hangout and the house is walking distance to downtown if not a quick uber from everything! Thanks Stan for the great stay :)
,,,,,,,,"I stayed in Stan's home for with seven others for a weekend and it was perfect. There was plenty of room and it was just a short uber ride from downtown. If you enjoy jogging, there are low traffic streets nearby that make for a great run."
,,,,,,,,Stan was very helpful in making us feel welcome. He provided is with recommendations for the neighborhood and helped Accomodate us with unique sleeping arrangements.
,,,,,,,,"Host was very helpful and attentive with details leading up to our visit.  The neighborhood was wonderful with many restaurants and services nearby.  The house was comfortable, clean and very spacious.  Great screened in porch out back."
,,,,,,,,"Stan was a most helpful host who assisted us in planning a perfect stay in Austin. The house was dressed in lights for the holidays and couldn't have been more magical. Stan has made improvements and changes and most recent photos reflect this.  They are all great.
This is a perfect family home for a holiday. The house is deceptively spacious with comfy beds and plenty of towels. We easily accommodated a party of nine of mixed ages. We took full advantage of the selection of board games available.
The area is residential with a lovely park at one end of the street and a range of stores, cafes and restaurants within a couple of blocks. The Capitol building was a 15 minute walk directly along 12th Street.
We had a wonderful time.
Two nights was not long enough at all!
"
,,,,,,,,Stan was wonderful both at communicating and accommodating.  He had a bottle of wine waiting and the whole house was lit up and very welcoming.  It was just as great as advertised and we were blocks from everything.  
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect size and location for a 3 couple vacation. Stan's home is a perfect layout, clean and a perfect walking distance to shopping, restaurants,coffee shops, and the city.  It is a 15 minute Uber ride from the airport.  Stan was easy to communicate with and very accessible. We had an awesome time in his home and city. "
,,,,,,,,"Stan has a great home that's very convenient to downtown and has its own local amenities within walking distance. Stan is a great host that has a genuine care for his guests' experiences. He's close enough to help with anything you many need, but you still feel like it's "" your"" home while you're there. 

We were a group of six pretty big guys and the home was certainly large enough for us. We could have been another 1-2 guys and maintained the same level of comfort. Families can likely comfortably fit even more people here. 

All in all thumbs way up. Whenever we are back in Austin with a similarly sized group we will certainly hope that Stan's home is available to us. "
,,,,,,,,Just got back from ACL weekend and we had the opportunity to stay at Stan's beautiful house.  It was everything we needed a nice place to crash and a great location.  The location was so nice that we actually ended up looking up property value.  The million dollar neighborhood was just a bit out of our range.  Maybe next year.  Stan was very accommodating and let us even check it a bit early.  We appreciate it. Like I said the location is great I think the most we ever paid for a taxi was $20.00.   
,,,,,,,,Stan was an extremely accommodating and welcoming host! He had a bottle of wine and a guidebook ready for us and even allowed us to check-in 2 hours early since we flew in early on a red eye flight. We traveled with a group of 8 for the ACL festival and the house was very comfortable and in a great location. Thank you Stan!
,,,,,,,,Stan was very informative before our stay and we got to meet him when we got to the house. He showed us around a bit. The house was beautiful. My friends were obsessed with the book selection around the house. The house was perfect for the 9-person group. The private bedrooms and 3 bathrooms made getting ready super easy! Ubers/Lyfts were around $10 to downtown Austin - not bad at all! Good restaurants around the house too! Great running trail near the house. 
,,,,,,,,"Stan was a great host who provided all of the info we needed before arriving and was easy to contact. He left us a bottle of wine and a detailed packet with information on the house and neighborhood. The house is even better than described and is close to a Whole Foods, a coffee shop and a few other restaurants/stores. The kitchen is great for cooking with a group and the back patio is a lovely spot to relax at night. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms had nice towels with shampoo/soap.

Stan was a great host particularly when there was malfunction with the AC. He was very responsive and made everything right. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great house! We went to Austin with a group of 10 girls and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Clean, convenient and perfect for a large group. The host was great and really helpful in making the weekend awesome. "
,,,,,,,,"I echo Michelle's review below: the house is  even more beautiful and comfortable than the pictures show! Thank you Stan and Kelly for letting my friends and I stay here for a bachelorette party/July 4 weekend! The open kitchen was a great area for all of us to gather, hangout, and eat/make breakfast! The living area is much bigger than what the pictures show. The whole house was amazing! There was also a great screened-in backyard, perfect for eating breakfast!

I also really appreciate Stan and Kelly for their responsiveness to all my questions, before and during the trip! We didn't know how to use the dishwasher (I guess, silly us) and Stan was so responsive about it. We also appreciate the abundance of towels and the shower gel/shampoo/conditioner dispenser! Genius!! :)

I would not hesitate to stay at Stan and Kelly's classy and beautiful home again! The location of the house was also spot on - not far from all the necessities (restaurants, coffee, groceries) and so easy to get around the city via uber."
,,,,,,,,Amazing time! The house is even more beautiful and comfortable than the pictures. The owners have great taste and lots of art :)
,,,,,,,,"Kelly was friendly, accomodating, and flexible. She was a pleasure to meet and made me feel as ease with renting a house in an entirely different state. The house was spotless, very well designed, and worked perfect for all 9 of the guests to have their own bed. The neighborhood was a wonderful location-easy to find delicious food within walking distance and easy to get a car-Uber to take us beyond walking distance. Perfect place to stay!! Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Kelly & Stan were great hosts during our bachelorette trip to Austin. The house was beautiful and spotless when we arrived.  The house was perfect for a big group and it is in a great location.  The girls had a great time at the house and we would absolutely recommend this house and the hosts to anyone looking to spend time in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Kelly & Stan were the most welcoming hosts to our trip to Austin. Their home was not only beautiful and spotless when we arrived but they accommodated our schedule by allowing a few people from our group to interrupt early and drop their bags before check in and extended check out for us. Their home was cozy and perfect for a big group with great seating in all rooms and comfy beds to sleep. The location too was great with all places we wanted to go a very quick and inexpensive cab ride away. We would absolutely recommend this house and the hosts to anyone looking to spend time in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Such a lovely house so close to the action!  Thank's Kelly and Stan for an amazing SXSW!
,,,,,,,,"Kelly and Stan were fantastic hosts! They were easy to get in touch with and very responsive. Additionally, their house was beautiful, they were welcoming and helpful, and very accomodating! I would absolutely stay there again! "
,,,,,,,,House and Host were great. Check-in and check-out was clear and easy. 
,,,,,,,,We had an excellent experience!  Wonderful house great neighborhood.  Kelly and Stan made us feel very welcome!
,,,,,,,,"Kelly and Stan went out of their way to offer assistance for our group traveling from different corners of the country. They thought of everything from lending a yoga mat too having a delicious bottle of wine and bag of coffee waiting for our arrival. The house was perfectly clean and spacious. Everyone had ample privacy with the ability to socialize together in a large open floor plan. The house was stocked with everything you would need. Plenty of fresh towels, comfortable clean linens, and shampoo and body soap dispensers in the showers, as an avid cook I found the kitchen was completely outfitted. There is an awesome back porch that is entirely screened on which we enjoyed lunch and breakfast. We were able to get Uber within 5 minutes even during ACL weekend and we were able to reach anything we really needed within a very short car ride, or a long walk, yet the neighborhood offered a very comfortable sense of security."
,,,,,,,,"The house is in an awesome location and very cozy. I would highly recommend staying here, especially because Kelly & Stan are so great! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time in this beautiful home. It had everything we needed, and most importantly, comfortable space for the group of girls from across the country to re-unite and catch up. I left taking lots of mental notes about neat ideas to decorate my house. =) It was also easy walking distance to some very delicious brunch spots, and generally very easy to get around. I would highly recommend this house for a wonderful get-away!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 118 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Perfect house for a reunion of friends which just happened to be the formula 1 weekend.  Plenty of room and great outdoor space for all hang out.  Very clear instructions and great suggestions for our visit.  Would highly recommend this place to future Austin visitors...
,,,,,,,,"Kelly & Stan are amazing hosts! We had a great time in Austin and their home was exactly what we were hoping for and more. They went above and beyond to ensure our stay was enjoyable (personalized maps, restaurant and entertainment suggestions, etc.). I highly recommend that anyone looking for a great place to stay while in Austin definitely  stay at Kelly & Stan's home. I know that I will definitely be back soon. "
,,,,,,,,"This place cant be beat, the location was prime, the house was huge, plenty of beds and bedrooms, great deck area(s) to hang out, and a great number of things in walking distance! We had a large group stay and Kelly and Stan were incredibly accomodating. "
,,,,,,,,"I needed to find accommodations 1200 miles from home for a very special weekend.  I found Kelly and Stan's place through Airbnb and could not have been more pleased with the whole experience.  The house was perfect for our needs and was exactly as advertised.  It was fully stocked, very clean and Kelly and Stan went above and beyond to help make our graduation  weekend a great success.  I would most assuredly recommend this home for anyone.  Karen and John"
,,,,,,,,"Kelly was great, flexible and easy to work with. Couldn't ask for more. The house was amazing... great location, nice and open perfect for a group of Austin visitors. Especially liked the hanging decoration in the front yard. I would recommend this place to others in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"Kelly and Stan's house was gorgeous. We had a lovely stay and could not recommend it more highly to future guests. Classy, upscale, clean, and extremely well-located. Kelly and Stan were very helpful and responsive hosts, and they even allowed us to extend check-out due to our late return flights. We hope to stay with them the next time we are in Austin!"
15463618,,10,10,9,10,10,10,"The location is perfect! Close to several restaurants, food trucks, the auditorium shores and Barton springs pool.
The apartment is gorgeous, nicely decorated, clean, bright and spacious with two bedrooms! Unfortunately no TV though. Rachel is really nice and a great host!! Her suggestions on things to do and restaurants were just perfect! I would recommend this place to any of my friends!!"
,,,,,,,,It is a good location in Austin and you could drive easily to where you want. There is good kitcken for cooking.There are two bedrooms and two bathroom.
5396676,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Close to the freeway, accessible to restaurants. Clean and spacious house. Kids loved it"
,,,,,,,,Great location with a great view.  Was a great getaway for us and our dogs.
,,,,,,,,This house has an amazing view of the state Capitol and the UT tower.  It is extremely quiet for being so close to the interstate.  I would definitely recommend to friends and family as a great value for the money and would try to rent again should the occasion arise. 
,,,,,,,,"This spot was the perfect stay in Austin! The space was great, the beds were comfortable, and the view was amazing. We had the best time here and would highly recommend it! "
,,,,,,,,Was a very comfortable and nice place to stay.
,,,,,,,,"Allen's house downtown was great, it had a sweet view of downtown Austin and the capital. Along with a balcony and a lot of a space and patio to relax. Would definitely recommend this place to anybody and would love to stay there again! "
,,,,,,,,House was everything that I expected from the posting.  Very close to everything.  I good place to stay for an event at the Erwin Center.  Check in and out was very simple. 
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely perfect! Stayed here for a weekend with friends and everything went so smoothly. Our hosts allowed us to have a relaxing vacation because everything was so organized. They had everything we needed to cook and relax. Great space! Clean and well decorated with so much room. Beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were nice. Cute porch swing off the master bedroom. Very quiet inside the house despite the highway being so close. View of capital building during sunset was really pretty. Hosts provide Keurig machine with K-cups which was heaven for us coffee lovers. We didn't have a lot of time around the house because we were out exploring, but the hosts provide an array of books and movies with a great TV in case you plan to spend some more time there. Plenty of parking for those who have a car. The location is perfect for visiting downtown Austin. A quick 5 minute drive to many locations. Hosts provide a manual at the house with many great recommendations. Our favorite was Jester King brewery (25 minute drive from the house). Would absolutely recommend this rental to anyone! Perfect hosts, location and amenities with plenty of space!"
,,,,,,,,"This Airbnb was absolutely perfect! Incredible location and super clean. The place is stunning and very well kept!

Everything is as described and even better. John was extremely organized, responsive and great to communicate with. We were also provided all the information we could possibly need in connection with his beautiful home.

This is a great example of why John is a Superhost! Very well deserved."
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed Austin and staying at John's house. It's a great place and a very convenient location. John made it very easy for us (solid communication / lots of recommendations). Would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great view!"
,,,,,,,,Our stay was great! The place was very clean; John was very accommodating and it was everything we had hope for.  the location was perfect as our main purpose for visiting was going to a UT football game.  A bit further away from 6th or Rainey as we expected but was a quick cab ride.
,,,,,,,,Loved my stay.  The suggestions in the book were great.  Very nice house and great first AirBnB experience.
,,,,,,,,This was the perfect location for a concert at the Frank Irwin Center.  We were in the middle of everything and opted to take a super easy walk to see our concert and avoided traffic and ticket lines completely. The home is absolutely beautiful. My group LOVED the big kitchen and  common area upstairs - the outdoor patio offers stunning views of the capital building and the UT clock tower. We truly enjoyed our weekend in this home and would stay again!
,,,,,,,,"John and Camille's home was a perfect place to stay in Austin! My friend and I came to Austin to check it out because we are thinking about moving there so we wanted to be either, in downtown or fairly close. John and Camille's place was in the perfect location. It is right next to downtown! We were a little skeptical about it being next to the interstate, but the noise wasn't bad at all. In other words, it didn't keep us from getting any sleep. 
The check in and check out process was very smooth. They were very detailed in their directions, which made it easy to understand and follow. 
We fell in love with the city and plan to move there in the beginning of next year, and John and Camille are partially to thank for that. If we ever need a place for a short stay in Austin, we would definitely want to stay here! "
,,,,,,,,"We had an AMAZING time in Austin.  We were thrilled with the rental experience, on day one we walked to 6th street from the place.  The other few times we used a driver app and had no issue with the location at all, it was perfectly central.  We are already hoping to return next year and stay in the same AirBNB!"
,,,,,,,,Great house with everything you could possibly need!  Easy access to downtown and overall great experience.  
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely nothing I would change about this experience.  The house is wonderful, possibly even better than the pictures show. It has it all from location, to layout, to style and quality.  Without a doubt I would stay here again and would highly recommend to others.  

Thanks for welcoming us into your home!!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a terrific experience. The house was immaculate and the views of Austin were stunning. We were within one mile of the Statehouse, close enough to walk into the city.  Even before we arrived, we were provided with an owners manual that gave detailed information about the house and surrounding area. Would we come back to Johnâ€™s again? In a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"This house was absolutely immaculate! Such a modern, yet cozy and open spot with an impeccable view of the Austins downtown! To see the skyline from here was perfect every night. 

Location, upgrades and stylish immunities made it easy to call this place home for a few days and I totally recommend it. I know that the 5 other friends that stayed with me here for a bachelor party would also very much agree!

We absolutely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,The place was amazing!!!
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place to stay to visit Austin 
,,,,,,,,Great location! Awesome place. Fully enjoyed staying here.
,,,,,,,,The house is exactly as described and pictured.  It's in a great location and the neighborhood is very safe.  Plenty of parking on the street and a lot of space inside the house.  Camille and John responded very quick when I had issues with the A/C.  Great hosts and a great home!  Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Firs time doing Airbnb, it was a great experience and I'll never stay in a hotel again. The house was outstanding, with a beautiful view and it was right in the middle of everything! Hosts were great, they responded to questions quickly and they seemed like great people! I highly recommend staying at their home."
,,,,,,,,"John & Camille were extremely responsive in their emails, which was great. This house is really roomy and had a killer view of the capitol. A few minutes away from everything. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay!   My first Airbnb;  will definitely try it again.   Hosts  were extremely nice and generous with their home.    Great communication    Fantastic  views,  Nice and open floor plan upstairs with plenty of  room.  Spacious bathrooms.  "
,,,,,,,,Chris was very responsive which was much appreciated! His House guide was SO detailed that it made the stay a breeze.
,,,,,,,,What an amazing place! Host always answered with help! Great location for both night life and UT game day. 
,,,,,,,,Awesome location! Perfect for Longhorn football games!
,,,,,,,,Love the place will book again for sure
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice and private home. Would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This was my second stay at John's home, and it was as great as the first!  This home is a fantastic value for the area.  The 2-story layout makes it feel very spacious, and the view of downtown from the top story is fantastic.  It is located just across the Highway from downtown, and is walking distance to shops and restaurants.  This is definitely my go-to location when staying in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,This place beats every place! Great host and great art!!! Met him and he invited us out to a night he was super nice and accommodating! 
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great about this experience. Easy access, great location, beautiful home. The type of place you'd want to live. I'd stay again."
,,,,,,,,Five stars all the way. The perfect AirBnB.
,,,,,,,,The house was amazing! In perfect location! The decor was awesome! Very clean! And very thorough directions on use of house! 
,,,,,,,,"John's place was perfect for a long stay in Austin (before we moved into our own new home). The amenities were all just as good as the description if not better, and the space was really eclectic and Austin-y. We'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"They were great hosts and their place was much better then I thought it could be( which I find usually the opposite) unique place, in a great location.

Very responsive as well, wish I could give six stars."
,,,,,,,,"I would highly recommend staying at John's home, due to the ease of communication and the ability to be located near everything Austin has to offer. Thank you for a wonderful weekend! "
,,,,,,,,The best place in Austin to stay!
,,,,,,,,"John's home was absolutely perfect for what we were looking for - a super convenient location (right by the highway but no noise at all), great views for some of the first-time visitors of Austin (could see the capital and UT from the living room), and chicly laid out for easy living.  We slept 6 comfortably and enjoyed their tasteful decor."
,,,,,,,,"John and Camille's place was perfect. It's convenient to downtown, just two walking blocks from Franklin's BBQ and has every amenity you could ask for. From a value standpoint I can't imagine better with two bedrooms, two and a half baths, office with large Mac monitor, washer/dryer, fast wifi, second floor with full kitchen and living room sporting a giant smart TV with surround sound. 

Even though they are right next to the highway there is zero noise noticeable. Because they live here as well they have a nice bar set up and don't mind if you have a glass or two (don't abuse!). 

To explain how great they are, I left my wallet at their home and Camille called me to let me know she had found it and proceeded to wrap it better than a Christmas present and overnighted it to me the next morning. Thank you!!

I'll be back to stay the next time I'm in Austin for sure. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place to stay and get ready before our wedding, thanks so much! "
,,,,,,,,Pretty awesome location and size for the price. Not much walkability but great view of the Capital building. Great living room set up. Right off I35 and not the best couch in the living room but very clean and organized
,,,,,,,,Nice house in a very convenient location
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was my first experience with Airbnb. John and Camilleâ€™s were responsive to all of my questions prior to booking. The house is beautiful and offers a fabulous view of downtown. All the comforts of home awaited us when we arrived. Based on this experience, I will continue to use Airbnb for future travel accommodations. "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb stay and I was very impressed. Camille and John were so friendly, the house is amazing, great location, affordable. Beds are comfy, TV is big, kitchen is new. They left a whole bunch of tips for local spots to visit on the table. My friend with me said ""Do not expect future Airbnb's to be as good as this because they usually aren't."" "
,,,,,,,,"John's place was very clean and even bigger than it looks in the pictures! We were pleased with our stay. This would be a great place for a party (although we didn't have one). The living area furniture is really sparse and not very comfy so it's not really the type of place for a lazy Saturday on the couch. But, John has a HUGE TV :) Master bath is amazing -- two showerheads! Very good location if you plan to visit anything downtown. Just of 35, but surprisingly quiet considering. Although it has two beds and two bathrooms, it's not really set up for a family or large group -- singles or a couple would be best. I wish the second/back unit were better labeled."
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful home, 2 stories, 2.5 bathrooms, a lovely balcony and little backyard. So close to Franklin BBQ you can practically smell it. The house rules were laid out and answered any and all questions we had. Great place, would stay again and definitely recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Our host (John) and his home were perfect for our group! There were detailed instructions on how to access and enter the house, wifi passwords, tips/recommendations for the area, and even offered a drink from their bar! We left an item at the house and he was very responsive in helping us retrieve it. Would definitely stay here again. It's not right downtown, but was only a few minutes/easy uber ride to anywhere we wanted to go. "
,,,,,,,,"John couldn't have been more accommodating. The house itself is amazing, large bedrooms, plenty of bathrooms. The view is incredible, better than the pictures. We had an absolute ball in Austin, largely due to the fantastic place John provided us with"
,,,,,,,,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was perfect...John and Camille have an amazing place! Everything was exactly as described. Convenient location. Easy to walk or just a $5 uber ride to any place downtown. They were both very responsive and helpful via email.  I hope to stay here during my next visit in Austin...Highly recommend...
,,,,,,,,"Lovely house, couldn't have been better for us! Unfortunately we didn't meet John and Camille but they were incredibly communicative and friendly. This is probably one of the best, if not the best AirBnB homes in Austin. You will not be disappointed. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing house, the best ive ever been in. One of a kind"
,,,,,,,,"John and Camille have a fantastic place if you're visiting Austin! Just on the other side of I-35, you're in a quiet neighborhood with convenient access to everything, and a great view. Their home is beautiful and comfortable as well. We're definitely going to staying here during our next visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Everything was exactly as described. Convenient location. Easy to walk to any place downtown. Plenty of room for our group of 6 for SXSW. Would highly recommend and stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"John was super responsive and helpful via email.  Unfortunately, we ended up having to miss our stay and he was kind about that as well.  All aces!  Hope to stay at his place soon. "
,,,,,,,,"John's house was ideal for an Austin getaway.  The location was centrally located - right off the highway, within a 10 minute walk to the Capital, and a 5 minute Uber ride to Rainey St. or W. 6th St.  The neighborhood was quiet (outside of highway traffic buzz) and there was plenty of street parking.  The house was well equipped, clean, and spacious.  We felt quite comfortable in John's home.  We thoroughly enjoyed the large window in the upstairs living space overlooking the Capital.  We wouldn't hesitate staying at John's house again."
,,,,,,,,"John was very responsive. I wanted a later check out than what was in the policy and he was able to accommodate me. I didnt realize that the location was behind another house which was not described. I wish that would've been better explained. I don't know if I would have picked this place had I known, however it was awesome. And I never even saw the folks that lived in the first house. "
,,,,,,,,"The entire experience with John and Camille was great from start to finish. They were extremely responsive, and helped answer my questions or concerns. Five girlfriends and I took a trip to Austin to explore the city for a weekend, and it was perfect for our needs. We all stayed very comfortably and the location was great! You definitely can walk from the house to downtown, but you should sport tennis shoes. Otherwise, the Uber rides were quick and inexpensive. I'd recommend this place for any group of friends looking to have a weekend in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,John was great from day 1. His instructions were very clear and we had no problem finding or getting into the house. The house was exactly how we saw it in photographs. The view was the best part! We had an incredible time exploring the city & we are so glad we chose this house. 
,,,,,,,,"This house is by far one of the most unique houses I have ever been in. There is so much cool random stuff scattered around that you'll have a great time exploring the insides of the house. They have a record player, a whole bar full of bottles for use, tons of board games, an exciting book collection, honestly it made me want to meet the hosts and be friends with them. 

Besides all of the cool things, the house definitely provides for all of the basic necessities and much more. It's really nice and I would definitely recommend, as it's only a short walk away from downtown and it provides easy access to the highway for travelling anywhere in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"All in all a very great experience staying with John. He was very prompt in getting back to me when I had a question and the house looked just as what was described! Johns house is in a very convenient location with a great view of the capital building! It is minutes from all the major hot spots in downtown Austin and I would definitely recommend this location to anyone whose visiting, especially those visiting with kids!"
,,,,,,,,"Your home was even better than described!  It was perfect for our stay in Austin.  Great location and amazing view of the Capitol.  We were able to walk to the Capitol, or walk to one of the Austin bikeshare stations.  The East Austin area is up and coming, with nice shops and a few restaurants.  
The house layout is great, 2 bedrooms and baths were just right for the 2 couples in our party.  The kitchen/living room upstairs area was great to wind down from our day.  It was very welcoming.  If back in Austin we would love to stay again.  Thank you so much!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was amazing! A great spot & very close to the city's nightlife! The place itself was very clean, nicely decorated, & cozy! "
,,,,,,,,My friends and I rented John's downtown condo on 13th for a bachelorette weekend. We couldn't have been more thrilled with the location and the place. They thought of every nice touch to make our weekend perfect. The view was gorgeous and the location was right where we wanted to be. I have already recommended this place to several of my friends and would be happy to recommend this place to anyone
,,,,,,,,"If I could give this place one  million stars I would.  I fell in love with the view of the capitol.  Watching the cars go by in the early evening was so soothing.  Great bar selection.  Great record player.  Not to mention the dÃ©cor of the place is beautiful.  Cool mid century modern pieces.  Loved the Cuban artwork!  The upstairs felt so open as did the kitchen.  Great for a someone that likes to cook like myself.  Some of my favorite nights were spent just laying on the comfy couch and watching a movie.  The location of the place is spectacular.  It's on the eastside, which is the best area in Austin.  All the great bars and restaurants are nearby.  If downtown is your thing, then its a quick hop across the highway. It was always refreshing to come home at night and crawl in the comfy bed.  I can't wait to get back to Austin and stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,The location and house was wonderful. The house was in beautiful shape and was great to stay in. Would reccomend this house to anyone who is looking! Very close to downtown and was a great place to stay.
,,,,,,,,"Johns house is beautiful! So clean, spacious and great communal areas. Both bedrooms were a good size and the beds are really comfortable. We were able to walk to a lot of places with ease and to catch an Ã¼ber was really cheap. 
All communication with John was excellent. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this house! "
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay! The house was clean, and the location was perfect. Super easy to get an uber to any part of town for $5 and quickly. We enjoyed the communal space and the view of the capital was great. "
,,,,,,,,"Great house! I stayed here for three nights with a group of 6 ladies between Christmas and New Years. We all had plenty of room and bathroom space. The beds were comfy (the air mattress could stand to be replaced. The girl sleeping on it ended up with her butt on the floor from deflation and moved to the window seat). The location is great! If it hadn't been unusually cold, we would have walked to 6th street, but ubers were cheap. All the finishings in the house are really nice, the kitchen is great, and the very best thing is the view!  Thanks John! "
,,,,,,,,John's place was great. Fantastic view of the capital and location to walk to great spots! We thoroughly enjoyed all the recommended eateries around and will especially remember Uchi! 5 stars! 
,,,,,,,,"This place was great! The host made us feel very welcome, and provided great instructions. Descriptions were spot on, and the home was really nice. We had a really awesome trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"John is a great host and the place is perfect. Looks just like the pictures, and the location is awesome. The highway is right next to the place, but there is no traffic noise at all. Would stay there again next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The house was great, centrally located - we only walked somewhere once or twice, but Ubers were very cheap to all areas of Austin even if it was surging a little. Living area was beautiful with a great view of the city, we didn't spend too much time in the house but great to come back to, and would be nice if you were planning to cook at all during your stay. The key was kept in a lockbox which was nice since it enabled our group to split up and return to the house at different times because we just key the key in the lock box when we left the house. Book of suggestions was nice. Shower in the master bedroom was great, 2 shower heads! Didn't have any problems. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Very nice apartment a short walk to all the great Austin nightlife. Had an issue with the couch, and John was very quick to respond . Would be happy to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,The house looked exactly like the pictures. Beautiful view of downtown. House had plenty of room for all 6 of us. Not even a full mile to 6th street which was a plus! 
,,,,,,,,"Wow, this place is incredible!  Close to major Austin attractions/restaurants/coffee/drinks, a stunning view from upstairs, and almost sound proof windows blocking all of I-35's noise, this place is legit. We will definitely book ut again next time we're down if available.  Thanks John"
,,,,,,,,"John's place was great, the house and space was fantastic, and it was really easy to find and get around from. You can really tell that John takes care of the place, it has a very comfortable feel. And he was very easy to deal with on all aspects. I would highly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"My colleague and I were in Austin for a Conference and John's place exceeded our expectations. Nicely renovated, clean and lots of room with great views of Capitol Hill. The location is fantastic with a quick Uber ride to DT.  Everything went off without a hitch and John was very responsive whenever I had a questions. I would definitely stay here again next time I am in Austin.



"
,,,,,,,,"Terrific stay, just a short 10 minute walk to sixth street, great views.

Thanks John!"
,,,,,,,,"House was great. Good location, close to the Capitol, Zilker park and 6th street. Very clean and well maintained, matches the photos online. Host was very easy to work with and friendly."
,,,,,,,,John has an awesome place in an excellent location. All the rules are clear and he answers quick all the questions we had. The details in the decoration are very special and classy. I will look to staying here for all my future visits in Austin. What a nice place with a great guest.
,,,,,,,,"John's house was very modern, clean, tech-savvy and close to everything with a short Uber ride. My colleague and I stayed for a conference in town. John quickly answered any question I had and made our trip super easy. The house is close to the expressway but you never hear any outside noise. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"John's house was awesome. I was hosting close friends from the East Coast and they all raved about the house. The aesthetic was modern and interesting. The view was incredible. The kitchen was spacious and convenient for cooking. The location was perfect: a cheap uber ride to Rainey, West / Dirty / East 6th, etc. We will definitely try to stay here again next time. "
,,,,,,,,The pictures do justice to this meticulously renovated and carefully managed property. Thanks for making it available. 
,,,,,,,,"John was such a great host and he made our weekend very easy and comfortable.  If I had any questions, he got back to me right away. His house was beyond gorgeous and everyone that stayed there said that they would stay at the same place again. The place was beyond clean and very spacious. Location was perfect. Right near 6th street and Rainey street.  Beautiful view of the Capitol as well. The freeway is very close as well, but you don't hear any traffic which was a huge plus. I highly recommend this place to everyone!!! "
,,,,,,,,"The place was huge, quiet and very centrally located. Beds were comfy and house manual very clear. John was always accessible by email. We would definitely recommend, and would stay again ourselves. Thanks John!"
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing view! Plus a gorgeous house and unbelievably close to UT and downtown! Host (and manager) were very accommodating. Perfect weekend long trip, thank you!"
,,,,,,,,My experience this past Labor Day weekend was far greater than what I expected. The home was very clean and a reasonable walking distance from 6th street. Getting in contact with the host was very simplistic and the rules of the home were very clear and understandable. I can honestly say I have no complaints and would recommend John's listing to any of my friends.
,,,,,,,,"I was in Austin for SXSW with 3 colleagues, and John's house was perfect for our needs. Carly, who was managing the property at the time, was extremely accommodating whenever we needed anything. 
It was all very comfortable, convenient and low-stress. 

If you're staying here for an event downtown, just note that it's 1.2 miles from the house. Close enough to walk or ride a bike easily, and just far enough that you don't want to return home too often throughout the day. Which worked great for us. "
11442375,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Amazing place. Close to everything. Chet made sure we had everything we needed for our stay and even more. I would defenietly highly recommend this place if you're planing trip to Austin. I couldn't ask for more! Thank you Chet! 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean and in great condition. It was well communicated by walking or a short car ride to many parts of Austin including great restaurants, bars, and shops. Chet was easy to communicate with and check in was seamless. Would absolutely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,This place is amazing and very close to downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"Always look forward to my stay in Austin when I can book one of Chet's places.  Well appointed, great location, and everything I need to feel comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"Chet  does a great job with his Airbnb.  Always welcoming, quick to respond.  This trip (I've stayed many times), we had an issue with the hot water and Chet addressed before I returned from work.  Just a simple setting adjustment needed.  Great location, walk to Whole Foods, lots of great restaurants, easy parking.  "
,,,,,,,,"Very comfortable stay at Chet's place in downtown. It's a great location in general, as it is close to campus, downtown, nearby restaurants (including an awesome breakfast at Counter Cafe just a couple of blocks away). Overall, a really nice experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Chet's place was perfect! I loved being able to walk to so many great shops and restaurants and Whole Foods. It's in a great Market District location, yet still has a neighborhood feel. The place was much bigger than it looked in the pictures. Super comfortable bed and very cute charm that reminded me of my place when I lived in Austin during school. I didn't meet Chet in person, however he was very responsive and gave me all the info I needed well in advance. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to others :) "
,,,,,,,,Perfect location. Got a real feel of the city. So many shops and attractions nearby! I would look to stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Chet had great recommendations and was very accommodating! 
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in Austin with easy walking to downtown and great restaurants close by.  We enjoyed the back yard as well as the apartment.  We would highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,This is a perfect location for a quick trip to Austin. Very quite and close enough to downtown for a cheap ride or taxi.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was absolutely wonderful and one reason was because of this sweet little place!  We had no problem finding its location, the directions for entry were very clear, the location was great (and quiet), and the host went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. The little extras are what caught my attention. There were snacks and a refrigerator stocked with water waiting for us when we arrived. That was definitely a nice touch and appreciated. 
We would not hesitate to stay here again if/when we return to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Was more than we imagined. Completely hassle free experience . I felt right at home in this cute little apartment. We walked to Whole Foods several times and walked down 6th St. to Congess Ave. and also to see the bats at the Congess Ave Bridge. Loved the coffee house and eclectic shops in the neighborhood too! Hope we get to stay here again.
,,,,,,,,Great host.  What a great place.  Very modern and chic.  Location is perfect to walking to restaurants and short cab rides to downtown.  Highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Welcome email gave me all the info I needed, but the best bit was the flat itself. Private, clean, well-appointed, and with RIDICULOUSLY soft sheets. The bed was mega."
,,,,,,,,"Was in Austin for a conference, so this was a nice retreat from a full day in the city going to panels and hanging out with people. Great bonuses of the Sweetish Hill Bakery as well as Clark's Oyster Bar in very easy walking distance. But, everything is very close. The house itself is well air-conditioned which was a plus because it was quite hot during my stay. Very comfy bed. Nice supply of bottled water. Little outdoor place to sit outside if you want. Great place. Would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Another great stay at one of Chet's properties. Very well located, awesome patio, plenty of room and nice extras not found at many other Airbnb locations. Highly responsive host. Have stayed here before and intend to again."
,,,,,,,,"What a terrific apartment! Cozy and comfortable with every amenity provided for forgetful travelers, this Tiny Tasteful accommodation boasts a full (& well-equipped) kitchen complete with a nifty Nespresso machine. There is Apple TV, a sunflower shower head and the most comfortable bedding.  . .even on the pull out futon."
,,,,,,,,"Chet's place is in a great part of town, exactly as described, clean and extremely comfortable. Chet was highly communicative. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"This house was so great, such a great experience. Chet was so helpful, quick to respond if we needed anything. The space is exactly what it looks like on the pictures, and clean! This location was perfect, walking distance of plenty of restaurants and walking distance of the ACL shuttle bus area at Republic Square. The reviews didn't lie, PERFECT SPOT"
,,,,,,,,"Chet and Sonni's place is a fantastic airbnb stay. We stayed for four nights, planning to eat our way around Austin while working from home during the day. The apartment is spacious, with plenty of room for two people to work and live comfortably. The bed is large and comfortable, with a couch and full futon to boot. The apartment has all the amenities you could possibly need in the bathroom and kitchen. You will have everything you need to cook, plenty of storage, and absolutely lovely hosts. 

What's more, the location is fantastic for getting around Austin. There are lots of places to run or walk nearby, as well as many of Austin's favorite bars and restaurants within walking distance or a very short drive. 

I couldn't recommend this place more highly - good for everything you need!"
,,,,,,,,"Chet's place was wonderful. Very clean and beautiful apartment. The back patio was a great and beautiful place to decompress in the afternoons. The apartment is a stone's throw away from several restaurants and bars, and walking distance from downtown. Chet is a very responsive host. Highly recommend - the apartment is better than in the photos!"
,,,,,,,,Love staying here when I travel to Austin on business. Great value.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in Austin at Chet's place! Location is great. Nice, safe neighborhood with tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance. Clean, comfortable and cozy apartment let us relax in the air conditioning when the Texas heat became too unbearable :)"
,,,,,,,,I enjoy staying here while traveling on business.  Great location!
,,,,,,,,Chet realizes that Austin is hot and supplied us with 8 water bottles upon arrival that were a life saver. The neighborhood is just off of Lamar yet there's no noise.
,,,,,,,,"I love this property, have stayed here many times, and plan to return. Amenities, patio, and host are all A+"
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful apartment in a great part of town- quick walk to coffee and pastries in the morning, and a nice stroll to all other parts of town (waterfront, 6th street for drinks, capitol building, etc). Our group really enjoyed our stay at Chet's place. "
,,,,,,,,"I enjoy staying at this property when I'm traveling to Austin on business.  Great location, parking is easy.  I've already made reservations to stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location. Would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Everything was as described. Cute and convenient. However, didn't know there were dogs above location. Not much noise barrier."
,,,,,,,,"Chet was super friendly and responsive. Place was very clean and perfect location for my quick trip to Austin - 2 blocks from Whole Foods, around the corner from Clark's."
,,,,,,,,"Chet was great!  Everything was exactly as described, great listing, great amenities, great location!  Close enough to walk everywhere but tucked away so the neighborhood is quiet.  Close to Lady Bird Lake for morning jogs.  Walking distance to an AMAZING Whole Foods, 24hr Diner, great restaurants and bars.  Very cute, charming, clean, and well stocked.  I would definitely recommend to everyone.  "
,,,,,,,,The house was so adorable & clean w/so many amenities!  The back patio was definitely a plus!  We met Chet briefly & he was so polite & made us feel very welcomed. We will definitely stay there again the next time we come to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location. On 6th but not the noisy part of 6th. A handful of restaurants are right there, and the Whole Foods is just an easy walk from there. 

The unit is super clean and cute. Had everything we needed like towels and an ironing board.

Parking is available and check in is super easy. Would definitely recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,"Chet was a great host, easy to communicate with and everything with his apartment was exactly as pictured. Everything was clean and the location was perfect. I would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Excellent place! Very clean and in a great location!
,,,,,,,,"Another great stay at one of Chet's properties. As usual, great responsive host and a clean, well stocked property. I will be back - again."
,,,,,,,,This place is amazing. Perfect location and Chet's tour guide information was very helpful. Easily accessible and your own covered parking. If it's available in the future will definitely book again. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Thanks, Chet! Your place was awesome. Love this place and I will return!"
,,,,,,,,"Host was very informative, the information was accurate and it is in a great location! Right off of Sixth St which has all the restaurants and bars within walking distance. Very nice accommodation and would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"What a nice spot, this is my second stay here and I hope I can stay again"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic little house in a great part of Austin. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Austin. Chet really went out of his way to ensure we had everything we needed and then some. 

Perfect location in walking distance to plenty of restaurants etc.

The house was cozy, quiet and relaxing. Full kitchen and nice size bathroom made the stay enjoyable. Thanks for everything Chet!"
,,,,,,,,Chet and Sunni's place was great! This was our first Airbnb experience but will definitely not be our last- this place set a high standard. The apartment was clean and exactly as described. There were drinks in the fridge and snacks on the counter upon arrival. The little touches like a fully stocked bathroom cabinet really helped us out when we needed beach towels and sunscreen to go over to Barton Springs Pool. We had a car and never had to drive more than 10 minutes to any location around Austin. Chet was friendly and had some wonderful recommendations when we asked for assistance. 10/10 would recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"The listing was perfect. It was a great location, so many amenities provided, and it was nice having our own entrance and parking spot. Chet and Sunni wete very quick to answer an questions we had. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,What a wonderful place for a stay in Austin! I was in town for work and wanted to stay somewhere close to the office. Chet's place was PERFECT! It had everything I needed. The bed was insanely comfortable. Will definitely be back in the future. Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"My family had a wonderful stay at Chet's place. The apartment is charming and well-appointed, and Chet and Sunni have thoughtfully included everything one could need. We had plenty of space for two adults and a kid.

The apartment is in a great location - we were able to walk all over the neighborhood to eat and explore, and it was very simple to get in and out by car as well. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was great!! The location was perfect, Chet was super helpful with tips and pointers about the city, and the apartment was really big and extremely clean. I would definitely recommend it to anyone going to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Chet is a great host, and his apartment is just lovely. The location is great, not far away from everything, and is a short walk from the hub of 6th street, and a short drive to all the attractions in the city. The apartment has all the essential things that we would possibly need - towels, laundry, kitchenwares, coffee, extra sheets, shampoo, etc. It made me feel like home really. Chet also provided many useful tips for us to explore the city. I would recommend Chet as a host to everyone who's visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,Amazing space in a great location!  Place was stocked with everything needed and even had some snacks waiting.  The outdoor area was nice and relaxing and great for for morning reading. 
,,,,,,,,This is a terrific place. Very clean and a super comfortable bed.  I hope to come back on my next visit
,,,,,,,,"The owners provided plenty of refreshments, snacks, and other things for us in case we didn't bring enough. The yard was gorgeous. Amazing stay, would highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect AirBnB experience! The apartment's pretty and cozy with everything you might need, and there's even an outdoor patio with a grill! And Chet was always lovely over email. We don't do air bnb that much but I would stay in this listing instead of a hotel again in a second. I fully recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved our stay. The apartment was exactly as described, very clean, and was stocked with waters, sodas, and some snacks. Chet went above and beyond to address an air conditioning hiccup and was quick and attentive throughout our stay. The location was superb and within walking distance of great restaraunts (24 Diner!), Whole Foods, shops, and down town. We'll be returning to Austin every year and plan to stay here each time! "
,,,,,,,,"Chet's apartment is in the perfect location for exploring Austin! It had everything we needed for our 3 day stay. The apartment is on a quiet residential street, but within only a few minutes walking to lots of great Austin spots -- including the HUGE Whole Foods!! I also went for a couple of great runs along the river, which only took a few minutes to run to from the apartment. My boyfriend and I both have Car2Go memberships, so if you don't have a car, it's a great option in Austin and there were lots of cars available in the neighborhood. 

Chet was easy to communicate with and our check-in / check-out process was flawless. I particularly appreciated the espresso machine, the very cozy bed, and laundry room. "
,,,,,,,,"The entire experience at the Tiny Tasteful 3 was wonderful.  Upon arrival we were provided with snacks and a clean, bright, beautifully decorated space.  There was plenty of bottled water in the refrigerator as well as soft drinks for our enjoyment.  We were in town for our daughter's Graduation and my husband, daughter and I occupied the apartment.  It was perfect for the 3 of us.  The bed and futon were both very comfortable for sleeping and we particularly appreciated the television with ""net"" service!  The neighborhood is GREAT with plenty of restaurant choices within walking distance.  My daughter and I had a fabulous run down to Town Lake Sunday morning and treated ourselves to a coffee and pastries on the walk back.  This will definitely be a repeat for us on our next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed my staff in Chet's apartment.  Very comfortable and super convenient to everything worth seeing in Austin.   
,,,,,,,,This lace is just perfect. Everything we needed was there. And very clean. Chet thought of everything and more. The patio was great with bubbling fountains. We walked to great restaurants and shopping. Great location. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"I was very impressed by this unit! Chet had it stocked with everything you could really need. It definitely has a home away from home vibe. I found the full kitchen very useful. The living area is furnished very nicely with a large TV and the bed was very comfortable. As a plus, there is a full bathtub. I found the study space useful, as I am a student and needed to get some work done during my stay. The patio was a great place to hang out also. The house is on the border of a great neighborhood for walking/jogging and 6th street, so you can either walk into downtown or up into a peaceful neighborhood. I briefly met Chet and he seemed like a super nice guy. I would want to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Beautiful home that was cozy and made me feel calm and relaxed the minute I stepped into the small yard - couldn't have been more perfect!
,,,,,,,,"Chet was an excellent host and responded to email very quickly.  He greeted us when we arrived and made some thoughtful recommendations for things to do and see.  The apartment was exactly as listed, clean, comfortable, fully stocked with all the basic amenities plus a few extras.  The espresso machine was a nice touch.  The patio is a good place to relax and read a book.  We didn't pack enough shirts to stay fresh in the Texas heat and humidity, so ended up using the laundry room as well - very convenient!  The location was perfect for us.  It is the quieter part of 6th, with an easy walk to downtown. So close to Amy's ice cream and Waterloo Records! :-) We didn't rent a car (but would if we went again, since there are many good day trips near Austin that would definitely be worth it).  Overall, very pleased with our long weekend at this apartment!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfection!  GREAT location in a wonderful neighborhood, pleasant interior, sweet patio.Chet and Sunni have thought of everything you need and maybe forgot!  Fridge generously stocked with drinks.  Can't say enough good things about this place.  Would definitely stay again and recommend highly to friends and anyone reading this."
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I really enjoyed our weekend in this apartment! It is an excellent location, in a cute shopping district and very near the flagship Whole Foods for stocking up on breakfast items, etc. There is a lovely, private outdoor area that we really enjoyed as well.  The linens were soft, everything was very clean, and Chet was enormously helpful with a couple last minute questions. Close to downtown and the river. Private and quiet, in a bottom part of a traditional Austin-style bungalow. "
,,,,,,,,My third stay. Not my last. I come to Austin 2 to 3 times each month and will stay here every time it's available. Outside patio area is outstanding. Close to everything. Highly responsive and accommodating host.
,,,,,,,,"Chet and Sunni's apartment was exactly what we were looking for! The location was great and the apartment was clean, a perfect size for two, and full of thoughtful amenities. Chet and Sunni were easy to contact and very kind during our visit. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. "
,,,,,,,,"Our hosts, Chet and Sunni, were so warm, helpful and accommodating, even letting us check in a bit earlier than planned.  The unit was beautiful, spacious  and homey-feeling in a perfect location, walking distance from downtown, the river,  Whole Foods, Book People (fabulous independent book store) and several nearby great restaurants.  We rented bicycles the entire week and never needed a car.  The unit included so many unexpected little bonuses, such as individual pre-packaged coffee and maker, bottled water, snacks, extra toiletries (I had forgotten my toothbrush and several were available) and many more.  The host's  attention to detail just added to a perfect vacation.  For many reasons, this was one of the best airbnb units I have used!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place and very thoughtful setup, Chet provides everything you can think of. Very relaxed setting in a nice part of town close to everything in a quiet side street. I will definitely look them up in the future when visiting again."
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying here! Chet thought of everything to make the stay feel welcoming and homey. Between waters, snacks, plenty of towels, and the toothpaste we felt right at home and truly enjoyed our stay. The back patio was a wonderful place to hangout and relax! The location is wonderful, easy access to great places to eat and have fun. Highly recommend this location! "
,,,,,,,,Chet was very welcoming and super easy to get a hold of. Bed was extremely comfortable and loved all the amenities. This location was very close to all the activities we decided to do. I would definitely come back. 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was spotlessly clean, quiet, and comfortable- exactly as listed. Chet was super accommodating. I would recommend to anyone staying in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The setting was wonderful, historic houses all around, just off 6th street and some fabulous eateries, but the house was so special.  All the thoughtful touches, especially outside, the running fountains (bird paradise), wood stove, chairs, tables, bird feeders, wind chimes, even the gates and stone walkways are elegant.  Inside, the same attention to detail and cleanliness, wonderful.  We had everything, and more, that we needed for a really nice stay.  The bed was very comfortable and the expresso machine easy to operate."
,,,,,,,,I've been coming to Austin 2/3 weeks per month for over a year and staying at Airbnb. This is my favorite which I will book any time it's available. Best amenities and attention to detail. Well stocked and supplied - and lots of great things within walking distance or $5 Uber. This is my second stay and will not be my last.
,,,,,,,,Amazing stay amazing place great peaceful location 
,,,,,,,,"Walking through the door I knew we made the right choice in where to stay. Great location, great patio, nicely decorated comfortable place. I'd stay here again and again."
,,,,,,,,"Chet's place was awesome! I visited during SXSW and booked pretty last minute, even so, the surcharge was fair, and the place was perfect! Very clean, comfortable, safe, and the fridge was stocked with tons of water. Chet was very responsive through text, and very helpful with directions. I would stay again in a heartbeat. AND just a short 10 minute walk to the center of everything. Great place, great people, thanks Chet!"
,,,,,,,,"I really loved this space. Chet was an amazing host and you could tell took the time to really make sure the apartment was fully stocked and in great condition for each guest. Something I really liked about Chet was that he was very responsive - he messaged me back quickly and it really made for a smooth trip! The apartment itself was cozy and comfortable, and the locking system on the door was convenient for travelers who have too many things on their mind to remember keys! I went to a little cafe down the street everyday for breakfast or lunch, and whole foods is just a couple blocks away. I also was able to walk downtown during my stay. Thanks Chet!"
,,,,,,,,Chet was up super late to make sure I got in and was super responsive when I was having trouble with the door lock. The place was stocked way better than a hotel and I didn't have to pay a dime for the extras. Location was great and it's a definitely a comfortable stay. A little noisy upstairs at times but wasn't an issue. I'd stay here again and again.
,,,,,,,,"For me, bigger than it looks in the pictures. The patio is the #1 feature - so nice to sit out and grill and watch the squirrels and birds. It is right next to a couple of very nice restaurants, but was surprisingly quiet for its location just off 6th street. I can't say enough about the amenities - the host has thought of almost everything from razors in the bathroom to bottled water in the fridge and an iron with board. Very clean and well laid out. Uber will get you to just about any 6th street pub or restaurant for $5 or less. I stay in Austin 2 to 3 weeks every month and this is my new favorite spot. I've already booked my next stay."
,,,,,,,,"Chet was a fantastic host with great communication. The space is amazing, it is in a great location with walk able shops and restaurants. It was very clean and cozy, with a beautiful bed and great decoration. A lot of time was spent in thinking about all of the amenities a guest might need and there were even little surprises that exceeded my expectations. If you have the chance you should book here immediately!"

5277272,5,9,10,10,10,10,10,"I visited Austin with 4 other girlfriends that I hadn't seen in about 5 years.  The loft was a perfect ""home-base"" for us!  Located just steps away from many bars and restaurants and spacious enough to accommodate all 5 of us comfortably.  Top Trip had the place stocked with complementary snacks, bottled water, coffee etc.  There was tons of info on the city Austin with suggestions of where to eat, what to do / see etc.  The loft is located literally above 6th street which is essentially a slightly more tame Bourbon Street, so don't choose this rental if you're interested in a quiet, relaxing vacation; but if you're down to get down, this is the place for you!"
,,,,,,,,Yes. Perfect location for my trip
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location!! Right on 6th street and Brazos. We ended up having brunch at Stella, a block over, inside the Westin. We didn't really have to drive while we were there since most everything you need is within walking distance. Cara was great. She answered all my questions right away and made the stay seamless. Will definitely use top trip rentals again!"
,,,,,,,,Very convenient and comfortable. Great place to stay right in the heart of downtown! Really appreciated the complimentary waters and snacks after a long flight.
,,,,,,,,We were all really happy with the apartment. Everything was as described and great location. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Great spot in the thick of everything Austin. Excluding city noise, this is a very versatile unit. Great team at Top Trip too. "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful staff and location!!
,,,,,,,,The location is perfect if you want to be in downtown. The access was super easy and convenient.  The communication was excellent. The snacks are a nice touch however the general maintenance of the loft was a bit subpar. Bathroom fixtures were dripping. There was also an odd drip above the kitchen sick coming from a pipe in the ceiling to the kitchen sink. Likely from the condenser for the air conditioning. Never seen that one. Sink was always being dripped on. Good value compared with the hotels downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"Great communication and an awesome location! The Top Trip team was incredibly fast and helpful with any questions we had, making our last-minute booking enjoyable and stress-free."
,,,,,,,,"The place was big, clean and in an awesome location! Would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Overall great stay. Location couldn't be better as it is situated right on 6th. Parking was close by and no hassle. Host was responsive and everything was just easy! 
,,,,,,,,Super nice loved our stay! 3
,,,,,,,,"Great loft space, very clean and ideally located. Wifi was a little slow but other than that this apartment was great"
,,,,,,,,Lovely apartment and very central. Had everything we needed for me and my two coworkers to enjoy a fantastic week of conference-going.
,,,,,,,,perfect location in downtown and easily accessible.  right on 6th street and entrance felt secure.  problem with fridge closing after hours and there was someone there within 10 minutes to fix it.  plenty of towels and comfortable bedding.  great stay!  will return for sure.
,,,,,,,,Great location on Sixth street. The place is pretty nice and great for groups. 
,,,,,,,,"It was a great experience. The host accommodated us at the last minute, and it was a great location!"
,,,,,,,,Very happy.  Great location.  Everything was as advertised.
,,,,,,,,"Highly recommend this loft, as well as the Top Trip Rentals team in general! the place was just like it was showcased in the listing, very easy to access, centrally located, making it a very smooth trip. 

Will definitely keep this in mind next time I am in town!"
,,,,,,,,Host was great I flew in on a red eye and didnt have my room access code but she called me back at like 600am to help me with access. Total life saver! Ill be back next year for sure!
,,,,,,,,Everything was completely wonderful :D
,,,,,,,,Chereen was prompt with communication and eager to please. We had a really great time staying at the loft. The location is perfect for accessing all that downtown has to offer.
15270093,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,"The location of this place is great. Easy walk to Downtown, 6th, Rainey, etc. It also has a great coffee and beer shop right next door. Koel was very responsive to any questions we had and was flexible about our check-in/check-out times and availability."
,,,,,,,,This was our first BNB and we had a great time. The host was more than accommodating and was super attentive! The place was in a great location. Very close to some really cute bars and restaurants. 
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Clean and awesome location!! Walking distance to bars on 6th street with several incredible food options literally downstairs on ground floor (sushi and pizza both delish!!). Koel was very nice and very helpful! Great response times and flexible with checking in and out. There was a nice tv and PlayStation. Ask about wifi, I don't remember seeing any. Would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Really helpful host. Great checking in and out. Really convenient location. 
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11677901,,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great host made sure we had everything we needed. His loft was extremely spacious .great views of Austin tx 
5469392,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Britton was a wonderful host!  He went above and beyond to make the place feel like a home for us during our stay.  Great communication before and during the trip as well, which provided an extra sense of guarantee. 

The place was even better than the photos, very clean and quaint. A nice, quiet escape from the busy streets of downtown Austin, it was a pleasure staying in the Clarksville neighborhood. Also super easy walk to public transportation or just a quick Uber to everywhere we wanted to go in Austin. The place was spacious and came stocked with everything you would find at a hotel. "
10069202,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,The apartment was lovely and in a fantastic location. Very well suited for a couple. We will definitely look into staying here again on our next weekend visit!
,,,,,,,,"Brett was a great host.  He quickly responded to my questions about the amenities & immediately welcomed us to the stay.  It was great, & without hassle, to be able to bring my dogs along on this trip, & my family & I would certainly book this room again.  Though there was no microwave (for popcorn!), there was, otherwise, a full kitchen, coffee maker, dishwasher, washing machine/dryer & all necessary supplies.  The balcony space is quite accommodating, with it's outdoor furniture & hammock chairs.  Thanks, Brett!"
,,,,,,,,"Brett's place was perfect for my girlfriend, me, and our dogs. The location was amazing, just a few minutes walk to the bars on 6th street. There's also a liquor store and delicious oyster bar pretty much right outside the apartment. The unit itself was very modern and the bed was comfortable! We'll definitely be booking here again in the future."
,,,,,,,,"Brett's place was perfect. Clean, central and good value. Brett himself was very quick to respond to any questions we had and was accommodating when we asked to extend our stay, he even moved us to a more appropriate room as there were 4 of us. 10/10 would stay again"
,,,,,,,,"Brett's place was great...super modern amenities, very well-maintained and a nice distinct style too. Brett was easy to communicate with and the place is in a great location. Would definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is exactly what the description and good reviews make it out to be! Very clean and well-equipped. Very comfy bed. Great location. I loved walking through the lovely Clarkesville neighborhood, being so close to the flagship Whole Foods, and enjoying morning runs down to the river/lake. Perfect place to stay on my business trip and still feel like I was experiencing all that Austin has to offer. Brett was a great host as well! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Brett was very accommodating, and the bed was so comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Clear communication, great photos, well-equipped kitchen, great TV and comfortable bed...  what a nice apartment!  Thanks Brett!"
,,,,,,,,Great location and wonderful host - I would highly recommend Brett's place
,,,,,,,,Brett's place was great! It is right down the road (walking distance) from awesome food and nightlife as well as a cafe for morning coffee/tea. The place was supplied with both body wash and shampoo which was a big plus when having to travel with only 3 oz of liquid. Brett was very accommodating and helpful when it came to having to change our plans a couple of times before we even got there. And was very easy to reach when we had a question. 
,,,,,,,,"Place was great, perfect for a week long business trip."
,,,,,,,,Very comfortable apartment in a great location within walking distance of the the heart of downtown Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Great location and Brett was very responsive. If it's just for you or a couple its great but otherwise the sofa bed is really more of a fold out futon than a full sofa bed and not exactly conducive to a couple and the linens could use a freshen up. The location basically on 6th st is great and just far enough down from the main bars and clubs of 6th st. that it's a great escape while still close enough to literally walk over and grab a drink! It's also right around the corner from the Hope Outdoor Graffiti park foundation 
,,,,,,,,"We had an awesome weekend staying at Brett's place in Austin in October 2016.  Brett was communicative and even accommodated an early check-in. The apartment is exactly as the pictures show and was very clean.  We had four people total and it worked well with two on the sofa bed.  Location was perfect - quiet area but walkable to 6th street, the river, and the capitol building and either a long walk (2m) to UT or Rainey street or a quick cab (tip: use the Fasten app for ride sharing).  Both a cafe and liquor store about 100 yards from the apartment which was super handy as well. Would definitely recommend or stay again."
,,,,,,,,"This spot is perfect for exploring downtown Austin. Close enough to walk to 6th street bars and about a $7 ride to Rainey street through the Fasten app (Austin's Uber). Very clean and well kept living space, super comfortable bed, and no disturbances (noisy neighbors, etc). Brett was also easy to work with and was kind enough to drop what he was doing to come let us in right away after being locked out within 10 minutes of checking in (make sure to have a key with you if you use the patio hammock chairs). Would recommend to anyone, we loved our stay!"
,,,,,,,,Smooth experience - Brett was a great host. Perfect pad in a very convenient location... not to mention one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.  Would definitely stay here again!  
,,,,,,,,"Everything as described, great communication, great location. "
,,,,,,,,..
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is in a great location, lots of space. The bed is very comfortable. Bret checks in with you but is not an intrusive host. "
,,,,,,,,Brett's instructions were extremely clear and I had no problem finding it and getting in at night (I arrived late). The place was extremely clean and comfortable. He even had a bottle of champagne in the fridge!
,,,,,,,,The listing description was accurate and we were walking distance to everything! perfect place to stay if you are looking to explore the city. Also great to rent bikes and explore everything that way. Would recommend and stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,Great area in Austin! We walked to ACL daily. 
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was wonderful, clean, full of amenities, and really felt like I was staying at a hotel. Brett was clear, prompt, and great at communicating. Check-in was incredibly easy and stress-free. The apartment was in great, safe neighborhood, walking distance to many restaurants and bars. I wish I had been able to stay longer, and highly recommend this listing for a very professional and enjoyable stay! I definitely plan on coming back!"
,,,,,,,,Great place... Great Location.... Brett is such a great host. The place is quite comfortable and very clean. 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect spot to explore everything Austin has to offer. Brett is a great, communicative host. Would gladly stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Fantastic time staying at Brett's place.  It was a good location so we walked everywhere negating the need for a car. The place was very clean and spacious.  The check in process was seamless and Brett was accessible and helpful.  We would recommend this place if you are staying in Austin
,,,,,,,,Brett was a great host and was very accommodating.  The location was ideal and the included parking spot was great.  Definitely recommend staying here.
,,,,,,,,"Brett was an awesome host! Responsive to my initial request and all questions that popped up between booking and staying at the property. We ended up staying in a different unit in the same building and it was just as good, if not better, than the one originally booked. I'd recommend staying with Brett, and would book again with him when we go back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Fun city! Cute apartment! Loved the decor. Great vibes!
"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exactly like the photos. The air was crisp and clean upon arrival and it felt good immediately upon entry. All lightbulbs worked, and the lighting in the space was excellent.  I ran on the lake in the morning and then finished with a beet shot at Whole Foods.  Then I walked to Swedish Hill Bakery (a landmark for Austin and delicious) and had more coffee. 
I slept like a Queen at this apartment.  It was quiet, comfortable, and serene upon wake up.  Bathroom has good towels, lighting, and toiletries.  Storage for clothing is excellent.  I loved this stay.  Was very worth the money.   Oh, and the private, dedicated, and covered parking was so awesome!  Thanks Brett!"
,,,,,,,,"Brett's apartment was a great home base in a scenic neighborhood close to all the action in downtown Austin.  The space was clean and tidy, and the bed slept amazingly.  I would recommend to anyone looking to explore central Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, I knew Brett was available if I needed him - he's an experienced Airbnb host."
,,,,,,,,Great space.  Great location.  We had a blast.
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay! Perfect location! Highly recommended :) 
,,,,,,,,The listing was very accurate and we enjoyed our time there! 
,,,,,,,,"Brett was the perfect host. He was super accommodating and welcomed us + our dog at the last-minute. His condo was clean, comfortable and in a great location walking distances to restaurants, shopping, bars and Whole Foods. We had a great stay! Thank you, Brett!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my boyfriend and I's first Airbnb experience and it exceeded our expectations. The place was nicely decorated, clean, and walking distance from everything! There was even a frozen pizza in the freezer and some Gentleman's Jack in the fridge. Will definitely be recommending to friends and family. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, walking distance to the flagship Whole Foods, comfortable apartment, comfy sheets and pillows, parking space right out front. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"What a property! This place was precious and had everything necessary for an awesome weekend in Austin. Most convenient was the location--it's such a treat to be able to walk to get groceries, coffee, dinner, a beer--whatever you feel inclined to have! It's also quite close to the hike-and-bike trail--such a charming property. Brett was prompt and communicative. I'm eager to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Good stay here! Place is clean, and right in the middle of everything! Couldn't ask for better. "
,,,,,,,,"First time using AirBnB and I wasn't disappointed. Brett's place was walking distance to bars, restaurants and Whole Foods, but tucked down a side street, making it quiet at night. Bed was comfortable, apt was clean, air conditioned and had all the basic amenities that we needed."
,,,,,,,,This was my second time staying at Brett's place and was just as great as the first time I stayed there!  
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, excellent suite. Home away from home. "
,,,,,,,,Host was wonderful -- answered all questions that I needed answered. Check in and parking were easy. Location is WONDERFUL! perfect distance from everything. 
,,,,,,,,"Brett was a fantastic host! He was so quick to respond to any questions we had. The place was so great, the location was the best. I love the neighborhood and was great for runners- we loved running to the Barton Springs trail on the green belt. The Hill Top Bakery is in the parking lot of the complex so it made coffee and breakfast easy every morning. The set up for 4 people was roomy as well. I would maybe recommend a air mattress for the 4th person though. More suitable for 3. But besides that every thing was beautiful and perfect. "
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was awesome and made my trip to Austin that much better.  Check-in process was quick and easy. All the 6th street bars were within walking distance and not to mention, Whole Foods was a 2 min drive if we ever needed groceries. The apartment was super clean. With a comfortable bed along with Netflix, this place was great."
,,,,,,,,"Excllent, clean home, in a great part of town. We loved our first trip to Austin and Brett and his space met our needs perfectly. Conveniently located, walking distance to pretty much anything you could need, and Brett made the logisitics super easy.

Thanks, Brett! Cheers!"
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely LOVED staying at this condo! We'd never been to Austin before, and it was in the perfect neighborhood--within walking distance of tons of cute cafes and restaurants, many of them just around the corner. As two New Yorkers we also loved having a dishwasher and washer/dryer in the unit. HEAVENLY! The bed and couch are both super comfortable, too--the perfect places to relax on vacation. And it was awesome that Netflix was available on the TV, as we had suspended our own subscription. When we couldn't find a coffee maker in the unit, Brett came over with one, and even brought us coffee to use with it! He is an above and beyond great host. Loved it all, thank you Brett! We'll be back!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment had a great central location and was easy to access with Brett's instructions.  Loved that there is a washer and dryer in the unit.  Brett was very easy to communicate with and was quick to respond to our questions.  I'd stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"As advertised. Easy check-in, clean and ready to go! Netflix died on us, but that's not on the host. "
,,,,,,,,This was my first time using Airbnb and this host made the process as smooth as can be. Very happy with accommodations and location. Clean and comfy. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"Brett's condo was a great place to spend the evening and had perfect access to downtown Austin. We were withing walking distance to multiple bars and restaurants, as well as a short distance from the Capitol, Zilker Park, and other attractions. It was easy to check in, attractively decorated and beds were comfortable, including the fold-out futon. While the kitchen was fairly well-stocked, we missed a few things, such as a corkscrew and coffee pot, but overall enjoyed our stay."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great! It was very clean and comfortable and while there were a couple hiccups (one was my bad, and the other was some random construction down the block), we'd definitely stay there again.

Location wise, it was really good as well - not too far from downtown, but a little quieter and a little cheaper with easy access to everything we wanted to do.

Also, Brett was on vacation when we rolled in, but he was still very prompt with his responses to a few questions which was much appreciated."
,,,,,,,,I hesitate to give a good review because this place was so AMAZING!!!! I travel for work and i would like it to always be available. Very clean!!! Very Texas!!! Very close to great food and nightlife!!!!
,,,,,,,,It happened to be the cosiest place that I have lived in. The place is perfect for couples and small families. Enjoyed my stay here.
,,,,,,,,Brett had everything ready. He was available to help with check in. 
,,,,,,,,Apartment was clean and comfortable. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Brett did an excellent job outlining the essentials in checking in and checking out of the apartment -- it was easy to follow. The parking spot available was very ideal for my friend and I. Brett also suggested excellent places to check out in Austin.

The place is absolutely lovely. The apartment/condo seems newly renovated. The place is very clean and also has essentials like shampoo, soaps, and towels.

The location is also not too far from the downtown areas of Austin. It is very walkable on a nice day, or about a 5-10 minute drive from places like Sixth Street."
,,,,,,,,"We LOVED staying at Brett's condo on Blanco St.! It was clean, quiet, and has a perfect location for being downtown. It's only a short walk from Whole Foods, Sweetish Hill Bakery & Cafe, and other local restaurants, etc. We HIGHLY recommend the condo for your next stay in Austin! Brett is very responsive and welcoming!"
,,,,,,,,"Brett was a great host. I was his first guest, and the place was spotless.  It's tastefully decorated, the immediate neighbors and neighborhood are quiet, and it's close to everything. The bed is SO comfortable! I would absolutely stay here again my next trip to Austin! "
5386787,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"The listing and description is accurate. You can't get any better with the location as it is only 3 blocks from the famous 6th Street! The host was easy to communicate with and quick with his responses. Seems like a nice guy too. The amenities is the biggest concern. The wifi connection was terrible. Only one of the cable TV remotes worked and there were a total of 5 TVs. It was very frustrating for each person to find the one working remote to change a channel in his/her room. The upstairs TV didn't even work. The master bedroom shower curtain was too short for the shower. Each time someone showered, there would be a significant puddle there. We had to throw 2-3 towels on the ground to soak it up. Good thing he provided an ample amount of towels. We stayed here during New Year's weekend, so we payed about $600/night. Premium pricing for subpar amenities. These are all fixable issues, and I'm sure he will fix it after this review. Can't beat the location though...."
,,,,,,,,"Was an awesome location, could walk right over to 6th street in no time. The apartment had plenty of beds for 8-10 ppl to sleep comfortably. Lots of towels and shampoo were provided in each bathroom which was a pleasant suprise. The living space was a little tight but with the whole city at your doorstep, we didn't stay inside much. Ryan was super helpful and overall it was a great place."
,,,,,,,,"Great spot, as advertised "
,,,,,,,,"3rd floor is great and balcony with views is awesome.  3rd floor also reduces the street noise on weekends.  Very accommodating hosts and unit was clean and as described.  Central to everything and big bonus to be able to walk/run to riverwalk.  We rented a car which was not necessary as everything is in walking distance.  Also, plus that airport shuttle drops off across the street at the convention center with fare of $1.75.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great stay.  Would definitely stay here again.
"
,,,,,,,,This condo is perfectly located for anyone attending an event at the convention center. It is as advertised and the location is convenient to downtown and Rainey street. 
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location, great apartment. 


Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Quick responses to questions, clear instructions on getting into the place,  clean and comfortable condo.  I'd stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, location and host. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan is a good communicator, and eager to help. This is run like a hotel, so you aren't getting the personal connection you may with another Airbnb listing. I left my travel kit in the bathroom and it disappeared with the cleaning crew. Multiple attempts to call and email Ryan resulted in no return of my property. This isn't something that would happen with a 1:1 home listing that I've grown to love about Airbnb."
,,,,,,,,"If you need central access to downtown Austin, this place hits the mark."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first ABB experience, I have to say it will not be my last. Our host Ryan could have not been more helpful with my first stay. 
The condo was great and was all that we expected. 
Thank you guys!"
,,,,,,,,Second time staying at this location. Such a great location and so well maintained. Looking forward to coming again soon. 
,,,,,,,,"The location was immaculate and they were very attentive.  The condo had more than enough supplies for the four of us. (Towels, bathroom and laundry supplies, coffee pods, etc).    The beds were extremely comfortable and they had extra blankets and pillows.  It was great having the dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer available.

It was close to the heart of everything - a few blocks to Rainey St and 6th street.  The convention center was around the corner and public transportation was readily available.  Great restaurants were nearby and we had a choice of many that were only a block away. (Piranha Killer Sushi!)

The complex was quiet and we felt safe walking the neighborhood even late at night.  I would highly recommend this location to anyone!  The loft was huge and isolated from the other bedrooms, so if I was traveling with my kids there would be ample separation.  
 "
,,,,,,,,My VP's loved everything about this place and thought everything was perfect. They loved Austin and will defiantly book again. 
,,,,,,,,The place is beautiful and has a whole lot of amenities to use.   Really good area downtown as well.  The only issue is parking but where isn't that an issue when your staying downtown!   Great place would definitely stay again
,,,,,,,,"Awesome place in the heart of downtown. Right next to hotels so there's always plenty of cabs (now that Uber and Lyft are gone). Place is clean, good amount of space, and has a great pool close. Would definitely come back!"
,,,,,,,,"Dealing with Ryan was a huge pleasure. He responded to everything we had thrown his way from the tiny things to the questions that I didn't even expect an answer for and he came through. The place is great and the location is perfect. It was a great experience and Austin was beautiful, can't wait to be back. "
,,,,,,,,Easy to find the place and checked in with no problems. I had no issues during my stay and so I never actually met with the host. Every bed had towels laid out already and plenty of dishes and utensils for guests. One of the easiest AirBnBs that I've stayed at and had no issues with the apartment. Would come again!
,,,,,,,,The condo is great!  Right across the street from the Convention Center.   On the 3rd floor (no elevator) but an easy climb.   Comfortable beds.  No dressers for clothing storage but closets.   Nice kitchen.
,,,,,,,,I was given a ton of info for the area. We had never visited Austin so we used a lot of what Ryan suggested.  The location of this condo could have not been better. We walked everywhere. The place was very clean and well kept. It felt upscale and that's exactly what we were looking for. We'd love to go back! 
,,,,,,,,"To begin, the place was amazing.  We stayed for a conference in the convention center which is literally across the street.  Six of us stayed incredibly comfortably and we even had a fellow conference attendee crash on one of the many couches one of the nights.  The kitchen was perfect for our purposes and was well stocked with spices.  Additionally, the host was kind enough to provide us with early check-in which made for ideal timing.  If I am in Austin again, I will definitely try to stay in one of Ryan's properties again.  "
,,,,,,,,"The location was unbeatable with easy walks to both sixth and Rainey streets even in the summer heat. The condo was clean and everything worked great. The coffee machine/pods were greatly appreciated. Ryan was very responsive, even with reservation change requests."
,,,,,,,,"The Director's Suite was a perfect location for our group bachelorette party. Plenty of comfortable beds and it was very nice having 2 full bathrooms. Checking in was very easy and Ryan was very accommodating when we needed a later check out at the last minute. Walking distance from great restaurants, bars, and Rainey Street. "
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience staying at this residence and working with Ryan. As a group of professionals in our 30's, the apartment met all our needs. The location is perfect and a short walk to all the hot spots in Austin. If you have a party of under 12 people, this location should fit your needs for any visit to the Austin area."
,,,,,,,,"Our host was great, though for whatever reason, we didn't get the confirmation email with the entry code when we arrived so we were in the humid weather for a little bit. Upon entry, everything was great. The photos are accurate, the place was very clean and the best part was that it was a block away from the conference we needed to attend. Location overall was great, walking distance to everything since Ubers/Lyfts are no longer available in Austin. The AC was working well at all times. It was overall a very positive experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and team were very welcoming. I used the welcome email they sent when we booked to help plan the trip, and leaned on the team for help with logistics (like getting a charter to pick us up at the airport). Would highly recommend Ryan!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean and tidy. 

Even though I showed up early, the host was kind enough to let us do an early check in. Had a wonderful time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The host went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience! Even let us have late checkout which was great. Great place and very responsive. 
,,,,,,,,"The Director's Suite was great!  Ryan was very helpful, and the condo itself is gorgeous.  It was spotless, and the beds were particularly comfortable. The layout of the condo is very conducive to entertaining, which was great as we were there as a bachelorette party.  The building itself is clean and very conveniently located to bars and restaurants.  I highly recommend it! "
,,,,,,,,"Very attentive host, and awesome condo!  We were in town for a couple of days performing at SXSW and things couldn't have been smoother.  We were given codes for entry so we didn't have to worry about holding on to keys, the pad was stocked with everything that we needed, including enough champagne flutes for our post-performance toast.  Definitely would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great Host! Great Place! Great Time! Have to say best bnb I been to so far. Will try to stay there everytine I'm in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Host was great! Location and home was cozy and spectacular! 
,,,,,,,,This is a great spot to stay in Austin!  We were there for SXSW and we were walking distance to everything we needed.  The apartment is very nice and modern.  We had 6 people and it fit us all perfectly.  It was clean and comfortable.  Great restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance.  Communication with Ryan and Thomas was great and they were always quick to respond and very accommodating. Check in was easy.  I highly recommend this place!
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and The Director's Suite exceeded our expectations. The apartment is in a great location,  is well kept, and has all the kitchen and bedding essentials you'll need for a stay in Austin. In addition, everything about it is as described online. Most impressive was Ryan's outstanding customer service throughout our stay, responding immediately to calls and texts and checking in to make sure things were going well. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's place was great! A really fancy apartment that easily slept 5 of us. Beds were comfy, had all the amenities we needed (car parking space was super useful) The best feature for us was its proximity to 6th street. We felt right in the heart of the city and only a few blocks to walk to get to the fun. The flipside of this is that it was noisy until quite late. This was on a Saturday though, i don't know what other evenings or other Saturdays would be like. I'd certainly stay here again."
,,,,,,,,The host was super responsive and helpful.
,,,,,,,,"Ryan--Just wanted to drop you a note to say thank you.  This was our third trip to Austin and by far The Director's Suite was our best accommodations.  From the reservation, check-in\out process, location, to all the helpful hints you gave us--wonderful and worry free trip!

We'll see you again next year!  Thanks again!  

Scott"
,,,,,,,,"Great place in the heart of everything Austin.  within minutes you can be on 6th St, or Rainey St all within a short walk.  Nice Condo with plenty of room for 6 guys."
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host.  We had some wifi issues and Ryan worked very diligently and resolved them during our stay.
,,,,,,,,Thomas and Ryan were great hosts. Extremely responsive and very knowledgable of the area. We all at a great time due to their recommendations.
,,,,,,,,Ryan and Thomas were very gracious hosts. They were responsive and helped a bunch when I accidentally left a burner on while we left for a quick lunch. I appreciated their consideration and quick thinking. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,Perfect location for downtown business travelers.  
,,,,,,,,Everything in the description was accurate. Great place :)
,,,,,,,,"Great place-great location! When we booked, Ryan sent us a very descriptive welcome email with all necessary information for how to get into the complex and the apartment, as well as recommendations for places to go. Ryan was also able to work with us for an early check in. Overall great time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, house was very well maintained. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. HIGHLY recommend this listing and would gladly stay again. "
,,,,,,,,We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend in Austin...great location and great accommodations!  There was so much to do and see that we didn't have time to fit it all in.  Can't wait to try Airbnb again soon!
,,,,,,,,"Great, centrally located apartment. Ryan was very responsive and accommodating!"
,,,,,,,,"Spacious loft in the heart of downtown Austin! It was ideal for our group of 10 in town to celebrate a friend's bachelorette party. We were able to walk to Rainey and 6th Streets, and there are a lot of cute coffee shops, cafes, and restaurants in the neighborhood. Ryan and his team were gracious hosts! They accommodated our check-in/check-out requests and were easily reachable for any questions that popped up during the weekend. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and unit. Perfect for groups and was very clean. 
,,,,,,,,"The house was solid. Only 2 bathrooms for a whole lot of beds, but clean and as described. Location is unbeatable and very central, so no car needed. Keyless access, so check in and check out are super easy. Hosts were very accommodating and gave us extra late check-out. I would highly recommend this property and these property managers."
,,,,,,,,Everything was wonderful 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was an amazing host! From start to finish he was incredibly welcoming and informative with the listing and its surrounding attractions. The place itself was fantastic, perfectly located in Austin near everything you want to be near as a visitor. Would definitely come back to visit Austin again. Would most definitely book a reservation with Ryan again. Thank you, Ryan! "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here for Keller Williams Mega Camp with a group of people and we rented both this unit and the Silver Screen condo directly next door.  It was perfect for our group!  Very walkable to everywhere downtown where we needed to be.  The unit was clean, spacious, and the keyless entry was perfect so we didn't have to worry about everyone having and keeping track of keys.   Ryan was easy to communicate with and very friendly the entire process.  I would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Great service!  I was in Austin on business with 4 colleagues and this was a perfect place.
,,,,,,,,"My experience with the Director's Suite and with Ryan Windsor were both phenomenal. Ryan was very accessible and flexible and - with one comprehensive email - provided me with all the information I needed to get set up in the unit. He also included local information in the event I wasn't familiar with the area. The unit itself is beautiful and had everything my 8 person group needed for our stay. The appliances were top notch, there was plenty of very nice silverware/plates/cookware for our use, having the use of a name-brand washer and dryer was a great bonus and all the cleaning products/soap/shampoo/conditioner, etc were also provided in the unit. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathrooms (and the entire unit itself) were impeccable and the temperature controls were excellent, which kept us extremely comfortable both day and night (it was over 100 one of the days we were there - the air conditioning kept the unit at our preferred temp of 68 without a single issue). The location is perfect!! We were able to enjoy three days in Austin without once thinking we needed a car - look for yourself on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and yelp - there is enough around this location to fill a month's worth of activities. The inclusion of a gated and reserved parking spot was perfect for my rental car and I was able to shuttle all of my friends back and forth to the airport knowing that - despite the traffic of downtown Austin - I would have a guaranteed spot back at the unit. In short, if you have a large group and are planning to visit Austin, definitely consider this unit! We paid less than what it would have cost us for a hotel and we got FAR more than we would have if we had all rented individual rooms. Plus, we had the benefit of being able to stay together and enjoy each other's company during the down times, which you just can't get at a hotel with individual rooms. Highly recommended!!!!"
,,,,,,,,Everything went great! My company and I stayed here for NI Week and Austin and loved it!
,,,,,,,,"The Director's Suite was absolutely perfect for the large bachelor party group we had. The style and decor are perfect for a bro weekend. The beds are super comfy and there are plenty, plus two plush sofas upstairs that could easily be slept on. Everything was stocked including shampoo, conditioner and soap. The location is great and you can walk anywhere downtown. Ryan was a great host. We had trouble getting in the door when we arrived, he had provided his cell number so I gave him a call and he unlocked the door from his phone for us (how cool is that?!). Then he recent the info email that had gone missing and periodically checked in on us via text. We loved everything about staying at the Director's Suite. "
,,,,,,,,"This was an awesome rental in a prime location. Everything (restaurants, bars, shops, etc.) is walking distance from the condo. We loved using a passcode for entrance rather than a key because this allowed for group flexibility. We (group of 10, all young 20's) stayed for 2 nights. We received the apartment in great condition (clean, well-stocked with supplies). I think had our stay been longer the space would have gotten too tight, but it worked well for what we wanted (price, location, amenities). The master bathroom was smaller than anticipated, but the description posted is fairly accurate. The loft space is a hidden gem! We never figured out how to work the TVs, but we honestly didn't try that hard. We were too busy having fun in Austin! Be aware that there is only 1 parking spot in the complex garage. Street parking wasn't too bad though. I would definitely stay here again in the future. Thanks Ryan!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was a great host!  This condo fit all of our needs perfectly.  The location is amazing, the unit is perfectly finished and great for a larger group.  Ryan was flexible with our check in and check out times and provided a great summary of cool things to do while in Austin.  I would highly recommend this place to others looking to visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Location was awesome, and the house worked out great for our group. Ryan was very responsive to any requests. I would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazingly Cool Condo, very stylish and the location can't be beat...The rooms are spacious, stylish, and super comfortable...Everything from gaining access to getting around town was made very easy thanks to Ryan's guidance and instructions... Will definitely book again when I'm in town...the experience was second to none... Thanks Ryan"
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location, great property, and fast support. "
,,,,,,,,"This is an extremely convenient location, close to the convention center and downtown. Lots to do in the area.

Ryan and his team did an excellent job with communication and requests. The Keurig with coffee available was a very nice touch."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent rental.  The condo was as described, was in great condition, and had all of the amenities that one would hope for.  Towels, shampoo, trash bags etc were all there for us.  Coded entries make the complex and unit easily accessible for a group, AC and comfortable beds made our stay very pleasant.  This condo is in a prime location if you want to experience downtown Austin.  Everything is within walking distance, and transportation to the airport couldn't be more convenient."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and his team were extremely welcoming and made the whole process very easy from booking to check-in to check-out.  All the info we could have possibly needed was written out, but they were always available by phone, too.  We were 10 guys for a bachelor party.  The location was perfect!  A short walk to both 6th St. and Rainey St.  The condo was in great shape.  I would highly recommend it for groups our size.  Only thing to keep in mind for big groups is there are only 2 bathrooms, but it wasn't an issue for us.  They let us check in a few hours early at the last minute since one of the guys in our group was there early.  I'm sure that's not always possible, but they adjusted on the fly.  Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Host was great, listing was as advertised and we were welcomed at the time indicated without any issues."
,,,,,,,,"The experience that we received from Ryan and his team was exceptional.  Every issue that we faced was dealt with quickly and to our satisfaction.  I would highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a nice, convenient place to stay in Austin.  It is in the perfect location -- walking distance to everything.  I would definitely look into staying at this or another of Ryan's properties on my next visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Very convenient experience.  The keyless entry makes checking in and checking out a breeze.  Great location, walkable in just a few mins to everything downtown.  Plenty of sheets, towels, toiletries for a full house.  An overall great experience.  "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and his team were very communicative, attentive and helpful. The condo was great for our group, very clean and in an unbeatable location. We were able to park our surplus vehicles at the hotel across the street for free and most folks were able to sleep (if we didn't stay up half the night anyways!). We only had one minor issue with the condo during our stay and Ryan's team responded very quickly. Thank you and I would definitely stay here again with a group in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place in the middle of Austin. All the best neighborhoods are in close walking distance, and the condo is more than big enough for a very large group. Logistics are simple with the hosts, and everything was very smooth for us. Would stay again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"Thanks to Ryan and his team, my friends and I (12 in total) had a great time in this centrally-located apartment in Austin. The whole experience from the use of a keypad so we didn't have to think about keys to the ample towels/linens allowed us to enjoy our stay in the comfort of a home without losing the luxury of a hotel. Ryan and his team are professional, friendly, and very quick to pick up the phone to answer questions. Thomas, in particular, has lived in Austin for a long time, so he could answer logistical questions about parking and also make recommendations for food and drink.

We'll certainly be in Austin again soon and will make sure to book this place again."
,,,,,,,,"it is a great location and was clean and well furnished. We added a cork screw to the kitchen equipment and had a lovely time. 

Only issue was one morning the parking spot was taken by another person but I think they had just parked in the wrong spot.

thanks for a great stay"
11227350,4.5,10,9,9,10,9,9,Great location!
,,,,,,,,Location was great
,,,,,,,,"We felt unwelcome from check in to check out. Complex did not appreciate the unit being used as an Arbnb. Host was not responsive to inquiries during stay. Minimal supplies for example toilet paper, towels, kitchen supplies. No coffee pot or mugs. Unit felt like a college dorm room. Furniture was damaged and carpet was stained and appeared dirty. "
,,,,,,,,"Great, perfect, exactly as advertised. Buddy is very responsive."
,,,,,,,,buddy was a great host.  the place was as described and I couldn't have enjoyed Austin more.
,,,,,,,,"Buddy's place is clean and well-located, right by 6th street and Whole Foods and trader joes. The roof and pool is amazing! The place is pretty pricey though for how small the living room is and the fact that the pool wristbands cost $100 each if you lose them. If your company is paying though, this place is well decorated and modern and has everything you need. There are even 3 tvs, one per room. I could walk to work, amazing food and nightlife.

Some cons: The air conditioning doesn't work in the left side bedroom so we had to keep the door open every night to circulate air.  Buddy answered promptly when I called him at 2am to get into the apartment but the building manager wasn't happy and said that the owner's real name isn't Buddy and made us feel a bit guilty. I guess the building isn't a huge fan of Airbnb."
,,,,,,,,"Place as described. Beautiful views, clean, new and a very nice building.  Super convenient to have Starbucks, Trader Joe's and Whole Foods all within a block or so. 

Key pickup is easy. Just remember you need the key to lock the door on your way out. It doesn't auto lock

Buddy is extrememly responsive on text which is Awesome!"
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful condo, seamless encounter! Loved the pool deck too overlooking Zilker park! Buddy was aval instantly with the one question I had!"
,,,,,,,,Great condo if you are looking for a place on the West end of downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,Great location. Great AC. Only 1 set of keys which proved a bit difficult as you need keys to go up and down the elevator. No live TV! :( couldn't watch football. But overall nice clean comfortable place. 
,,,,,,,,"Buddy's place is in a great downtown location, is appointed well, and in a fabulous building.  This place is great; and I plan on staying again!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is conveniently located, clean, and comfortable. It was a great value for what and where it was. I will go back the next time I am in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great apartment with an awesome view. Apartment pool is fantastic!! 
,,,,,,,,"Some basic amenities were not available (i.e. toilet paper, waste basket in bathrooms, extra towels for pool). Otherwise, Buddy was a good host, place was clean and close to all of the action in downtown Austin.  Pool was fantastic and overlooking the Austin skyline.  Overall good experience.  Would stay there again for sure. "
,,,,,,,,Great location with great amenities.  We had it for the Texas/ND game and it was ideal.  The pool and fitness area are also nice and added to the experience as it was mid 90's during the day.  Buddy was very responsive and getting the keys was seamless.
,,,,,,,,Perfect size and design for 4 people. Location was great. Roof top pool was stunning. The host was available almost immediately via text the whole time. 
,,,,,,,,Nice apartment in a great location!  Apartment is just as described. 
,,,,,,,,"La remise des clefs Ã  l'arrivÃ©e a Ã©tÃ© l'une des plus simple et rapide que j'ai eu, et de meme pour le dÃ©part! Si Buddy ne fournit pas beaucoup d'informations d'emblÃ©e dans son annonce, mÃªme aprÃ¨s rÃ©servation, il est rÃ©pond rapidement en cas de question. 
L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien placÃ© (vraiment, Ã  3 minutes du supermarchÃ©, de mon lieu de travail, et de la riviÃ¨re Colorado!), propre, avec un vrai ressenti de luxe tout a fait conforme aux photos. La piscine est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able avec une vue absolument magnifique.
TrÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour, je recommande chaudement!
"
,,,,,,,,"Buddy was extremely prompt in his communication with me prior, during, and post stay. The apartment and complex were absolutely perfect. Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Great clean place! Close to everything. 
,,,,,,,,The 2 bedroom luxurious Condo is beautiful & spacious! Buddy is courteous & quick to respond. A lot of The Bowie residents & doorman are not very nice nor welcoming! Not a Family Friendly environment!
,,,,,,,,"What was great about this place: Buddy was very responsive, it has great views of the city, and had a great pool. What It needed to be more comfortable: more than one towel per person (had to use same one for pool and bath), more than a few hangers, wash cloths, bath mats, full length mirror, bath trash cans, trash bags for kitchen, cork screw, any minor toiletries (other than shampoo) such as lotion or bath soap. It was also a bit awkward that there was not better seating in den, which had only the one couch in den so our group of four didn't have great options to socialize comfortably. Could also have used some art on walls.  The carpet needs some stain treatment, and bedding/pillows are pretty cheap. With all this, I am surprised  that there were so many excellent reviews...would think at least a few people would have made a few of these suggestions given the price point. When I arrived I reached out and buddy sent some things like soap and hangers, which was helpful, but these other things stuck out more the next few days so wasn't in line with expectations. On interacting with front desk, it was at times awkward given they don't like Airbnb people using the place (found this out on arrival). All of this may not be a big deal for most, but I would have opted for another spot I have stayed at before if I knew this. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay, great location. Buddy was very fast and responsive. Would stay again if going back to Austin. 5 mins from everything we needed downtown and the pool is amazing and relaxing."
,,,,,,,,"The place was better than we imagined it would be, the pool was absolutely breathtaking and Buddy was a prompt, friendly host that was quick to respond. "
,,,,,,,,The 2bd/2ba apartment was beautiful and great location with a short wall to everything we wanted to do in Austin.  Buddy was very helpful with the check in process and we enjoyed our stay.
,,,,,,,,"The place was awesome, great location. 
Super Clean! 
It was easy to check in and out. 
"
,,,,,,,,Awesome room and very clean. Wifi was a little slow but still had a great stay. 
,,,,,,,,"It's a beautiful unit in a gorgeous building! Buddy was always quick to respond to any and all questions we had. The Whole Foods across the street, and the close proximity to the river, and then then the closeness to dining is all walkable. "
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at Buddy's place. Exactly as advertised and just an overall excellent experience. Visited Austin for a work trip, but wanted to bring my family so they could get away for a few days and everyone loved it. The pool was perfect to entertain the kids during the day while I was at the office. Will definitely be coming back.

"
,,,,,,,,Buddy was the best!  This place is in the best part of town.  The pool is great.
,,,,,,,,"Buddy has a great condo-clean, close to nightlife and fabulous pool. He was super quick with correspondence, both before and during our visit. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing building and ammenities, a bit far from proper downtown, had some problems with the internet "
,,,,,,,,The listing description was accurate and a beautiful place to stay. Space and location was tremendous. Thanks for the great time! 
,,,,,,,,Always a pleasure staying here and would recommend this place to anyone
,,,,,,,,"Buddy was great and his place was terrific. It was clean and perfectly suited for our needs. Everything about the experience was seamless. The best thing about the situation was Buddy's responsiveness and support, perhaps among the best I've experienced."
,,,,,,,,"Three buddies and I stayed at Buddy's pad for our annual golf trip, 3 nights 4 days.  Unit is as advertised.  Buddy is very quick to respond, and was able to accommodate our needs.  Good times."
,,,,,,,,"I did not get the honor of meeting Buddy but he was very kind to assist when I needed assistance checking in. The condo was more than I imagined and I loved the location. The view was stunning. If you need a little getaway or a staycation I would definitely recommend coming here. The spot private and secluded despite it being so close to Sixth Street. Everything you need is right at your fingertips. Trader Joe's is literally, ""RIGHT THERE.""

"
,,,,,,,,"Really amazing place to stay while in Austin! 
Close to everything and convenient.
Pool on the 36th floor is amazing as well!
The apartment is exactly like the pictures and very clean!
Would recommend 100%
5 stars!"
,,,,,,,,Great stay easy access and great location.
,,,,,,,,"Buddy was an excellent host and the place is absolutely gorgeous! No need to stay anywhere else in Austin, it is the perfect location for accessibility to bars, Route 1, and Whole Foods. All of the essentials are included, with the exception of cable. Perfect for a resort-style getaway!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great.  Perfect location. Beautiful apartment and building.  Buddy handled everything perfectly.
"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was nice, clean, and everything was in good working order. Although the hosts were prompt to reply by phone or text, I needed to reach out on many occasions for questions and clarifications. Upfront and clear communication would have made the stay easier for both me and the hosts. "
11298009,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great location and awesome view!  Greatly enjoyed our stay.  Carlos was always available when needed.  Awesome experience!
,,,,,,,,"The original listing was already booked so the host Carlos offered us his other property at 51 Rainey St. for the same price. Wow. What a great place. Beautiful view, awesome building, and perfect location! Carlos went above and beyond to make sure we had an awesome stay. I texted him multiple times during our stay to ask questions or to ask for recommendations. He was always courteous and prompt with his replies. I highly recommend this property."
,,,,,,,,"The place was wonderful, very clean and the view was amazing. The location is very near to a lot of nice restaurants and extreme convenient. Carlos gave us a lot of recommendations for places to go and things to do. I will definitely come back. "
,,,,,,,,I didn't meet Carlos because he was out of town but his cousin was great with getting my co-worker and I setup in our apt and making sure we knew our way around.  Carlos kept in contact with us to make sure our stay was going well.  It was just what we were looking for in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Carlos was an amazing host! We stayed at a different property since this one was booked- it was amazing. On Rainey street, amazing view of the river and just a beautiful apartment complex. Also Carlos recommended some amazing places to go and eat and we were so thankful. NoVa was one of our favorites!! Austin is just awesome, hope to return again."
,,,,,,,,All good.
,,,,,,,,Has a great stay. Very close to bars and restaurants. No cable tv but a great common area. Would stay again
,,,,,,,,"If you want to enjoy Austin, this is the place.  Really enjoyed my stay and will be requesting this place again from Carlos!!!  "
,,,,,,,,Carlos was very welcoming and extremely helpful. He gave us many suggestions for the best restaurants and entertainment in Austin. The condo had beautiful views of Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"We booked Carlos personal home. This place was amazing, great location, modern with a crazy rooftop pool and the best view in Austin, Carlos was very accommodating and always there to help! Definitely recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Great view of Austin, and great area of town to stay in. Easy to get a good meal or drink, oh did I mention the view. Overall the stay was amazing, and communication was on point. Not a single issue."
,,,,,,,,"AMAZING VIEW AND AMAZING HOST- Everything was perfect. Carlos was great at communicating and we had a wonderful time. Since this location was booked already, he offered us to stay at his other private residence on Rainey St. This location was seconds away, walking distance, from the best bars, restaurants, and live music in town. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. We would definitely stay here again!!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was immaculate and better than we could of expected! Carlos was just as great! He was just a just a phone call or text message away at all times and provided recommendations for restaurants, bars, activities surrounding Austin. I would stay here again and recommend this place to anyone who is looking to stay close to the city and get the full Austin experience."
,,,,,,,,Carlos was great! Made the process very easy and was extremely helpful with suggestions on places to eat & things to do.
,,,,,,,,Carlos was a great host. He was sweet and helpful with my first time in Texas. He gave me a detailed explanation of where to go and the nicest spots to eat. I definitely recommend him as a host and the apartment is so lovely! I'm coming back. 
,,,,,,,,"Carlos was a great host and this place was booked through another service before we got ours confirmed.  Carlos offered his other private residence and it was amazing with incredible views of downtown in an incredible location near food, bars and music. Incredible would stay here again!!"
,,,,,,,,"We couldn't have asked for more! Stayed at Carlos' apartment with my boyfriend, sister and her boyfriend; our first stay in Austin and it was fantastic! Apartment was beautiful and very well located, we were able to walk to most parts of downtown. What made our trip though was Carlos' kind hospitality, he provided so many fantastic recommendations and continued to provide tips throughout our stay. Highly recommend!!!! Thank you again Carlos, we hope to be back soon :) "
,,,,,,,,"Carlos was very welcoming, we went into his own home (since his other apartment was renting), with an awesome view, and he helped us with everything. It's a great neighborhood, super well located for the sxsw event we were in. We'd gladly do it again next time. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,Great location.  Great appt.  Carlos was super helpful and accommodating.

She was so helpful. we truly enjoyed our stay every detail of this place is immaculate totally beautiful the view is breathtaking. Very safe building a neighborhood. So if anyone's thinking of choosing this place you can't go wrong. everything about it was perfect, location is walking distance, to anything you could want or need. Centrally located, so it's an easy, affordable cab ride anywhere downtown.
Definitely going back soon! "
10985692,5,10,10,10,10,9,9,Ty's place was perfect for our weekend. Great communication and place was as promised. Would stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is tucked away right off S. Congress and within walking distance to downtown - it really is the perfect location in Austin. Great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. nearby. 

Ty was very accommodating and helped answer any questions we had. His apartment was very comfortable (4 adult men) and perfect for our quick weekend getaway. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Ty was an extremely welcoming and a friendly individual to work with! 
Great location for SXSW!!!

"
,,,,,,,,Great location! Check in/check out was a breeze. Ty was very helpful and fast with communication. The bed was very comfortable! Definitely would stay here again. 
4855674,5,10,9,10,10,10,9,Super responsive host and accurate listing.
,,,,,,,,Very clean place located near tons of restaurants and nightlife. Would stay here again for sure!! Thanks! 
,,,,,,,,"The place was nicely located, it was good to get an email the day before allowing an early check in.  like the use of the key pads"
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Also, plenty of toiletries for all 8 of us. Would definitely recommend this rental! "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, exactly as described. It was brand new and in the best location. We could hear a bit of background noise from the street from the main room overnight, so would recommend for you people wanting to stay right in the centre of it all. Would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and the location is PERFECT. The apartment comfortably sleeps 8 as mentioned in the description. I don't know that I'd call this place spacious but 8 of us co-existed well in here for 3.5 days. There were plenty of linens, and toiletries to accommodate all 8 guests and high quality TV's in every room. One thing we didn't think about was parking. It's not mentioned but you only get 1 parking space, so any other vehicles will need to find additional parking. I personally thought it a bit odd that our checkout itinerary ask that we start a load of wash considering there is a $130 cleaning fee but we did accommodate the request. I also just noticed while re-reviewing the listing (this was not mentioned in our check-out itinerary email) that we were supposed to load the dishwasher and take out the trash as well."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, very clean place. The apartment and pool were smaller than expected, but did not take away from the trip"
,,,,,,,,Everything was great
,,,,,,,,"You can't beat the location, minutes from the convention center, 6th street, congress, and the river. Clean and modern, with all amenities provided."
,,,,,,,,"Erica was very prompt in her communication leading up to the stay! She answered any questions that I had in a timely manner and sent relevant and organized emails as our stay approached (check in information, amenities, etc.). The space was perfect for our group of 7 - it was clean, nicely decorated, had comfortable beds, and nice amenities (bathroom, in unit washer and dryer). The air conditioning and fans in the apartment kept everyone cool from the hot summer weather and the pool in the middle of the complex was convenient. To top it off, the location is in the middle of downtown walking distance from great restaurants and night life. We were walking distance from Rainey and 6th street and felt safe in the neighborhood. "
,,,,,,,,Really enjoyed our stay. The place was awesome and great location 
,,,,,,,,Awesome place.  Perfect location and exactly what need needed.  Would definitely stay there again.  
,,,,,,,,The place was beautiful! Very clean. The location was perfect. The amount of space worked out perfectly with our group of girls!
,,,,,,,,Great location!! We could walk to everything we were so happy there. The beds were great and the kitchen had everything we need to cook breakfast together. Keep in mind the give you a start kit on soaps to and garbage bags. If you need more pack it or plan on buying. Would totally stay here again.
,,,,,,,,The location of this condo was perfect for our needs.  We walked in and our party of five was instantly happy - clean and exactly like the plcs showed!  We especially liked having our own parking spot gated inside - it felt safe.  We appreciated all the towels and washrags that were provided as well.  We would definitely use this facility again!
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I were in Austin for a conference and just returned from a 4 day / 3 night stay at this condo. Everything about the space was excellent. It was clean, spacious (more than enough room for the 5 of us), centrally located (1 block from the convention center, less than 3-5 blocks from pretty much everything else), and had every amenity we could ask for and then some. The host replied to my emails promptly prior to my arrival and gave us a detailed list of instructions upon checking in. I would definitely recommend this rental and will try to stay here again if I find myself back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent apartment! Great location, had everything we needed and was clean and super organized. Communication could not have been any better. Thanks! :)"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was nice and neat when we arrived and ideally located. The only problem we had was trying to contact the host on Friday; there was no answer at the 24-7 number provided. Other than that, we had a wonderful stay. Thank you! "
,,,,,,,,"They were great at answering all of my questions.

They DO have an iron and extra pillows and sheets. They also have an IHOME. Also a HAIR DRYER

Don't have beach towels for the pool so bring your own. 

The location couldn't be better. Clean and comfy. Perfect for what we needed! Bottom floor-easy access to the street, coffee across the street and small but very nice pool area :) they also walked extra towels over as soon as I called. "
,,,,,,,,A terrific Airbnb! The TurnKey staff were available immediately when I had a question about parking and the keyless entry was very easy to use. The Airbnb is in a great location downtown and a quick uber ride to numerous restaurants and bars. 
,,,,,,,,"Everything described in the listing was true. Location was fantastic and convenient to everything. Rental was clean, all necessities were provided and stocked appropriately. Highly recommend this rental and host. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at the Downtown Condo last weekend with 6 friends. We came to Austin to celebrate my birthday and to have a reunion as many of us now live in different parts of the country. 

The Condo was clean, inviting, and centrally located. The seven of us fit very comfortably and we really enjoyed being able to walk to many of the more popular destinations in the city. We especially loved the proximity to the lake and great breakfast and coffee locations. 

Despite an issue with the toilet plumbing, we still enjoyed our visit. Turnkey staff was quick to respond to the issue and maintained a professional attitude throughout. I appreciate the 24 hour helpline because when we needed this taken care of on a Saturday, they were available and sent someone promptly.

I would stay at this condo again and I would also be happy to use TurnkeyVRs in the future. "
,,,,,,,,"Very nice neighbourhood, you practically trip over the convention centre (you couldn't ask to be closer). The apartment was exactly as in the pictures, well maintained and very clean. Excellent stay and I'll definitely be trying to rebook for my next conference in Austin. Most of my colleagues were jealous of the short walk to ""home base"" for the events. ;)"
,,,,,,,,This was a great apartment for 6 girls.  There was plenty of room and it was conveniently located. It was very clean as well.  I would definitely come back and stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"The location and condition of this condo was perfect for our group.  We attended a conference at the Conference Center and we were the envy of all of the other attendees who were getting off of their bus transportation to and from their hotels!  So easy.  
It was a great neighborhood with several bars and restaurants to choose from and it felt safe to walk around alone during the day back and forth from the conference.
Everything was as the pictures and description describe and we had no problems with the booking, check in or check out.
It was a four out of five star rating on the cleanliness which was great for the most part and I am very particular about that aspect.
The noise machine was great to drown out the traffic and voices outside.
There was not time to actually use the pool or cook at the condo, but having the living area to congregate after a long day with a glass of wine was fantastic.
There was a pretty good stock of dishes, but for a condo that sleeps eight, eight coffee cups would be suggested.
Having detergent for a mid stay towel washing and dish soap and toilet paper provided was great - thank you!
We were conscientious and never found the noise restrictions to be a problem so hoping that is the residents' opinions as well.
If I had a conference in Austin again, I would stay here in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was as described and efficient.  It was great for our business trip and we will likely return in the further.  Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Had a wonderful stay - couldn't believe how central the location was to other major hotels, bars, and restaurants.  Would have loved a later checkout, but otherwise a great location, layout, and aesthetic! "
,,,,,,,,"This location was perfect for our group! Plent of space, very clean, great location, and plenty of bed space for everyone to have a place to sleep! Communicating with the owners and their representatives was very quick and easy. Would definitely recommend for a group and for people who want to have a great central location!"
,,,,,,,,"The unit was perfectly clean and very nicely furnished.  Great location walking distance to many downtown attractions.

Initially had an issue with the parking remote being programmed with an incorrect code but it was resolved quickly after a call to Turnkey."
,,,,,,,,"This condo was central to everything we needed. It's walking distance to nightlife, coffee shops, restaurants, major hotels, the conference center, etc. The photos tell the true (URL HIDDEN) just a cool place that's very clean. Keller Williams folks coming in (URL HIDDEN) also directly across the street from the Marriott Courtyard that's one of the bus stops for taking everyone to the training center. It's perfect."
,,,,,,,,"Great Stay in Austin! Place was neat and clean when we arrived and the team was super accommodating and helpful. Had a slight mishap with the garage opener but people at the complex were able to assist. 

Would definitely stay again! Love Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"5 stars!!! The apartment was perfect for my stay in Austin, TX. Erica was more than accommodating, letting me and my group have late checkout. It was also wonderful not having keys to the apartment - we had easy access in and out with a code on the door. The entire apartment had the latest amenities, full kitchen with cooking supplies and table settings, and beautiful furniture and bedding. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is 5 minutes away from the main street of Texas (6th) but there are surrounding restaurants and bars in other directions as well. The apartment is very new and clean with a community pool just outside. The apartment is street level so we kept out blinds down. We didn't have to deal face to face with the host but did call and the service was very helpful. Overall good apartment, good location and good service. Would stay here again"

,,,,,,,,The apartment is in a terrific location. Brand new kitchen. The place is really beautiful and our stay was great.
,,,,,,,,"It was nice to arrive to a place that looked exactly like the pictures. Check in and check out process was very simple. The place was exceptional. The rooms were clean, spacious, and comfortable. The location was perfect. We were able to walk to all the bars and restaurants. I highly recommend this location. "
,,,,,,,,"Renting this condo was a great experience overall. The place was very nice and clean and had a lot of basic amenities already there for us. It was exactly as described and very roomy for 8-9 ladies to spend a weekend in. Excellent location! We walked all weekend. No issue with noise complaints or anything like others had. We were respectful of the quiet hours but still hung out playing games and laughing until the wee hours of the morning. 

The only drawback was parking in the area, but that is definitely not their fault. That's a general rule in Austin. 
We also had a very poor encounter with someone who must have lived there. Because of the parking situation, we had one girl pull into the gated parking area to unload all of her and several others' stuff. He pulled up and yelled at her to move her car immediately unless she had a specific parking space there. We had the first car in the space provided for us. It was very rude, but fortunately we had enough people out helping her to grab it in one trip so she could move. His car was only there for about 5 minutes and then gone the entire rest of the weekend. 

Other than that one encounter, it was a great weekend. All of the other people we met in the complex were excellent and friendly. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place. Enjoyed my stay. The host made it a extremely easy on arrival by sending detailed access instructions, wifi settings, and parking info ahead of time.

The beds were comfortable, the washer/dryer were fantastic, the climate control was very well set up, and the kitchen was great."
,,,,,,,,"As they say: location, location, location.  This condo was perfectly situated just a few short blocks from 6th street, congress street, and the state Capitol. It was the perfect central location for a weekend away in Austin.  

Beyond the location perk, this apartment was spotless and clean upon our arrival. Our host made it especially easy to check in and check out and is flexible on timing (within reason and if possible). We would certainly stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Erica and TurnKey did a fantastic job! The condo was in wonderful shape, and very comfortable. We slept 7 all week with no issues at all. The beds were SO comfortable. There wasn't an option to check in early or leave a little late, but it was based on the fact that this condo was very popular!

We had a great time in Austin, and it's so convenient to so many things downtown!

We would recommend this condo to anyone looking! Great job Erica and Turnkey! We had a fantastic experience. 

Thanks, 
The Paxton Group, Keller Williams Realty "
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful location and property. The condo is brand new appearing, the kitchen is excellent, and the beds and bathrooms comfortable.  we had 4-5 people staying for 4 nights and had a wonderful time. The location is perfect for the convention center and everything downtown. Access to the condo was very smooth as the directions were detailed. The building is very strict on noise. Do not congregate outside after 10!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is absolutely gorgeous and was perfect for the group of 7 we had in Austin this past weekend.  Everything we needed from toiletries to plates and glassware were provided, the beds were cozy and the showers had some of the best water pressure I've ever experienced.   the people at turnkey were also very friendly and everything was as they said it would be.   My issue has to do with some of the people on the property.  Over the course of the weekend we were called about 5 noise violations most of which were because we left a TV on in the living room before going out on the town.   They list 10-10 as quiet hours and I can understand and respect that, but we received a phone call at 7:30 on a Friday night about our noise level.  It was to the point where we felt like we couldn't even converse with one another.   It is too bad because the location itself it 2 blocks from South Congress and 2 blocks from 6th street and was ideal for our group who got together to go out and enjoy the Austin nightlife.   If you are looking to have a social weekend, I would not recommend this place because you will be called for a noise violation.  On Friday night I had to tell a lady at TurnKey about how outrageous these complaints were.    On top of that Thursday, Friday and Saturday night you could hear noisy college kids leaving the bar district from our windows.  I'm not complaining about that, in fact we were expecting that, but to not be able to listen to music in the living room at a reasonable noise, catch up with old friends from out of town and enjoy a few beers in our living room without being called by turnkey really was the ONLY issue with this place.   I also understand TurnKey is just doing their job so I don't blame them for this, but beware before you book that you have to keep quiet if you are staying at this place"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was beautiful, modern, clean and in walking distance to everything. It was on the ground floor so there was no need to lug our luggage up flights of stairs. I really liked that we didn't need to meet up with anyone to give me keys. That made things super simple and easy. Also, when I needed to get in touch with turnkey by phone or email, I got a response fairly quickly. 
Only two negatives: First, Turnkey never sent me an email with all of the info about the apartment, including the building gate code and the actual code to get into the apartment. I called them when I arrived in Austin and that is when they sent me an email with the apartment code but not the wifi or building gate code. I didn't realize how necessary the building gate code was until I came back to the apartment late at night and the building gate was locked. 
Second, the wifi never worked. 
Other than that, the apartment was great and I would recommend staying there to anyone. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location, clean, quiet. Great place to stay with multiple people. Plenty of room and all the amenities you could need. Easy to get in/out no matter what time you arrived."
,,,,,,,,"Very easy transaction with the TurnKey people, especially for us because we had a late arrival on the first night.  Great location is what drew us but after arrival, this place was like living in an Ikea showroom.  First class appliances, cookware, linens and everything else.   Even the bunk beds were of very high quality, and very comfortable.  The only blip was that the hot water heater was not properly set at arrival but the response was prompt after an inquiry.  We had to take rather quick and courageous showers the first morning, but it's now in the fun story of a sensational weekend in Austin.  I would highly recommend this property."
10836191,4,9,10,8,9,10,8,"The arrival process was perfect in terms of Michael's communication and meeting us. There was clearly something going on in the apartment or apartment complex, as there was a smell that just got worse and worse to the point where we ended up having to leave and not stay there. We were disappointed that the pictures did not match up to how the apartment now looks, but we would have been fine with it had that smell not gotten unbearable. HOWEVER, Michael was amazing in communication and guaranteed he would ensure a full refund (which we got within 24 hours). There were clearly issues with our stay, but I cannot say enough how appreciative I am of Michael for his responsiveness and desire to help make our stay as pleasurable as possible."
,,,,,,,,"It was very conveniently located to downtown Austin. Great for the SXSW conference. Good AC, clean, TV, WIFI. Place is a bit bare but very serviceable if you're planning on spending most of your time around town. "
,,,,,,,,"Clean, great location and host was easy to get in touch with."
,,,,,,,,Michael was very accommodating and very pleasant to work with. The apartment was perfect for a little weekend get away and the location was very convenient. We were able to walk to the majority of our destinations which was nice since we didn't have to worry about parking anywhere. We will definitely be back and working with Michael again.

4284646,,10,10,10,10,10,8,"We (a colleague of mine and I) stayed at Patrick's cozy appartment for a week during SXSW Interactive, and were happy with our choice.

The appartment is great for 2 people travelling, because the living room has a uber-spacious couch to sleep on and a little balcony facing the green, and the bedroom has a big, nice bed and is equally quiet. The central and calm location (5-10 min walk to downtown and all the conference stuff) in the back of a residential complex make it a great retreat for festival/conference-goers. The whole place feels clean and modern, with a dash of color from all the cool photographs hanging on the walls.

Of course, the great Wi-Fi and smooth communication with Patrick helped as well! We can definitely recommend this place for 2-3 people who know each other and need a cozy place to explore Austin!"
15274601,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Alan's place is in an unreal Rainey Street location. The location, building, and apartment itself are all fantastic. Alan was communicative and easygoing...we would highly recommend his place to anyone going to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,The communication with Alan was great. The key exchange was very easy. The apartment was clean and pretty big. There was roof access with a great view! The location was excellent! There is a small market and tons of restaurants nearby. The only downside was there was noise from the highway nearby. There was a white noise machine if that's your kind of thing.
,,,,,,,,"Great location, clear communication, over all good experience. Thanks for the stay! "
,,,,,,,,"Alan was very accommodatingâ€”met me late on a Monday night after my flight got in to show me the apartment and make sure I had everything I needed. The space was very clean, great view, and nice complex! Location was great as well. Easy walk into downtown, and steps away from all the great bars and restaurants on Rainey St."

Everything I could ever need in a place to stay. 

Two thumbs up!"
11167977,,10,10,10,10,8,10,"This sunny east side Austin apartment â€“ and its host! â€“ is a total gem. Jessamyn kindly bought us a few groceries (fruit, oatmeal, eggs) ahead of time so we had snacks ready upon our arrival. She had also left us a sweet note (with cute illustrations!) explaining wifi, laundry, apartment quirks, etc. Every room had its own bouquet of beautiful fresh flowers, adding an extra dose of charm and cheerfulness. 

Sleeping situation was great. Jessamyn provided us with an air mattress so each person in our crew could be comfortable. The sheets were quite soft (a factor that should not be underestimated!). 

I could lounge and live in this apartment forever! As far as decor goes, think cozy, hipster-chic. Buttery caramel-colored leather couch, a dope record player (which she let us use), vintage glass jars and cameras, cute succulent and cactus garden. 

Also, for any runners out there...the apartment was maybe five minutes jogging distance from a running trail that loops around the lake! We put our path proximity to good use in the mornings before venturing into the downtown mayhem of SXSW. The walk to the festivities/happenings â€“  Convention Center, Rainey Street, cool east side eateries and bars â€“ was also super easy (around 20 mins). "
12916775,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Lively hip area.  Close to downtown.  Big room.  Not the fastest WiFi,  but it did always work.  Not the quietest room because  I was on the street side,  but it is in the city.  "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah is a fantastic host and a very cool person - she went beyond to make my stay in Austin smooth and was helpful in every way. The place itself was convenient, had a great running trail practically in the back yard, and was super clean and comfortable. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Sarah's place is a wonderful experience. The room is spacious, comfy and quiet. Sarah is really nice and friendly. On my last day of stay I had to stay a little longer to use their wifi for a web-conference, and Sarah generously extended the hours of my stay. It's a great place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Sarah's place! Great location, clean house, comfy bed. Plenty of good restaurants and bars nearby."
,,,,,,,,"Very chick and clean place. Minutes away from downtown Austin, very grateful for the stay."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah really made me feel at home, especially when I was settling in on my first day. She kept me company, recommended some local spots for food and fun, and just made everything feel super relaxed and home-y. Would definitely love to stay with her again the next time I'm in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice place overall. A little bit far for walking to downtown. Sarah has a cat and a dog, to take into account if you do not like pets. The bathroom is shared with guests in the second room. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's home was truly delightful, we had a lovely overnight stay. Sarah's communication was great, she welcomed us & made us feel right at home:) The room was large, nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed. The shared bathroom was clean & available when we want to use it. The home is very well located to bars, groceries & eateries, some within walking distance & others a $5 ride share-Fasten (no Uber and Lyft). Austin has a great vibe if your thinking about visiting definitely stay a couple of nights and stay with Sarah. We would definitely stay again:)"
,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed our stay here, Sarah was super friendly and even let us arrive early. Thank you (: The house and restroom were pretty clean. Another plus is it's right next to the graffiti park which is a cool place to check out! Although the park can get crowded, the house does come with its own private parking lot which is a huge plus. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking to explore the city with a friend as it's not too far from downtown. Thanks again Sarah! "
,,,,,,,,Cute little house in an excellent location near UT and downtown nightlife.   The room is exactly as described with crisp white bed linens and a very comfy mattress.   Friendly visits from the puppy and cat who were just checking in for a friendly scratch behind the ears made me feel very at home.   Sarah was a friendly but non-intrusive host.     This was my first experience taking a ROOM inside the house versus renting the WHOLE apartment and I was pleasantly surprised.   
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I couldn't have asked for a better host. Sarah is attentive, friendly, and responsive. The private room is exactly as described, and had exactly what I needed for my stay. The full kitchen and living room in the shared living space were a bonus that you don't typically get in a hotel. Above all, the house is a home--Sarah lives there and goes out of her way to take care of her guests.

Sarah's doberman, Tillie, was a joy to have around. As Sarah mentions in the description, guests who are not comfortable around large dogs might not enjoy Tillie's company. I love dogs, so I was very happy to become friends with Tillie. (Note: Tillie sees an open door as an invitation to come into your room! I didn't mind, but if you want your privacy just be sure to close the door behind you.) Sarah's cat, whom she jokingly dubbed 'anti-social' even sought my attention once or twice.

The neighborhood is nice--you get the sense you are experiencing authentic Austin by staying there. Downtown Austin is about 25-30 minutes by foot--a walk I took every day during my stay. There are ride share options as well.

Overall I had a wonderful experience and l hope that the next time I come to Austin I am able to stay at Sarah's place again."
,,,,,,,,"This is the 3rd time for me to stay at Sarah's place.  She is very quick to answer her messages and phone calls.  We've had some issues with the lock on the door but I think she's worked it out by now.  The location is great; don't be intimidated by the graffiti wall; enjoy it for the Austin icon it is, while it remains.  Austin is actually my home but I'm away temporarily.  I know all the neighborhoods well and could stay anywhere; this is my choice until I get back into my own place.  "
,,,,,,,,We felt welcome and she was hands off which was nice for us! 
,,,,,,,,It was comfortable and she also have adorable cat and dog too. 
,,,,,,,,My first experience using Airbnb.  Sarah was a wonderful host and our room was perfect during our stay in Austin.  The location for downtown and 6th street couldn't have been better....I would recommend this home to everyone!
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's house was great! It was air conditioned and cool when we got there which was really nice:) the house is in walking distance from downtown and right next to a really cool graphite park.
House was also very clean and the bed was very comfortable."
,,,,,,,,Great stay. Great location. Great host. 
,,,,,,,,"Sarah and her large and adorable puppy Tillie (and a kitty as a bonus!) made us feel so welcome right away.  Sarah was very available to answer any questions we had, to make us feel welcome, and to make some coffee in the morning.  Tillie provided all the snuggles and puppy love a girl could ask for.  Between these gracious hosts, even though we only stayed one night, our stay felt more like we were at a friends house than in a hotel.  P.S. Miss you Tillie!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice, clean place, with a relaxed ambience. The room was spacious and comfortable and I liked being in a quiet place within walking distance to the downtown.  Despite being there only two nights, Sarah was a great host."
,,,,,,,,My boyfriend and I stayed at Sarah's during ACL. Even though the city was busy we found the house to be a nice quiet retreat. The room was clean and the bed/pillows were comfortable. The shared bathroom was also kept clean and tidy. Provided in the bathroom were some essential 'just in case' items for guests to use. The ibuprofen came in handy! Sarah was quick to respond to my questions via text and her dog (which we didn't see much of) is the sweetest! I would most definitely recommend this location for your Austin stay.
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay, and Sarah went out of her way to be a gracious host. Definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful host, lovely house and one very friendly dog!"
,,,,,,,,Very clean and welcoming environment! Right next to the Graffiti Wall which is great since its definitely a sight to see while in Austin. Walkable distance to 6th Street! Friendly pets and the room was very spacious for 2 of us to stay in while not feeling on top of each other!
,,,,,,,,Great host and location! Will definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,Sarah was welcoming and informative on the area and her place is very comfortable with a private bathroom and large guest room. located right above downtown Austin it's an a great location with easy access to everything. Her dog was also awesome! 
,,,,,,,,We received an email before our trip with all the information we could need. It was very detailed and helpfully Sarah was there when we arrived and showed us around and where everything was. Everything went great. 
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was an awesome host, incredibly friendly, welcoming, and attentive, and awesome company. Very flexible and accommodating with travel plans. The room was just as pictured, soft bed and pillows with a ceiling fan and great natural light. Easy walk to downtown as well. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
,,,,,,,,The perfect spot! 
,,,,,,,,Sarah has a lovely home and was really welcoming! She gave us loads of great recommendations for things to do that allowed us to enjoy Austin to the max. Would definitely stay again!!
,,,,,,,,Great host. House was beautiful and well located. Sarah is a great host and i would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Sarah's place was awesome and she was a super helpful host! Would definitely recommend this place to a friend. 
,,,,,,,,"Rachel was great and the listing was just what I was expecting. Great stay here. It's about 4 blocks from 6th & Lamar, so walkable to Whole Foods and lots of other things. "
,,,,,,,,Great weekend in Austin at Sarah's home!! She was kind and patient with us and always answered to our questions. The apartment was clean and pretty. A good address that I keep in mind. See you! 
,,,,,,,,I didn't have the chance to really meet Sarah but the place was very clean and the location is great. We had a great experience.
,,,,,,,,Great location and great host. Comfortable bed and very accommodating. 
,,,,,,,,Great host and location. 
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was awesome.  I was on a quick business trip and this was perfect for that.  Though, I would back here with my wife when there is more time to explore Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was awesome, our request was very last minute and she was readily available and easily reached. The room was great, plenty of space, big comfy bed with the bathroom right in front of your private bedroom door.

Right next to graffiti park so there's a lot of people coming and going but it didn't affect us. We got food at the 24/hour diner five minutes down the street and the food was to die for. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

Sarah was very flexible and even let us hang out a bit after check out since we had a long drive ahead of us and weren't ready to hit the road right on time. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Sarah! "
,,,,,,,,Very comfortable and warm like our home Thank you so much Sarah! 
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's home is an excellent place to stay. It's clean and spacious, and located a stone's throw away from restaurants and shops. She's also super friendly, so if you're looking for a good experience lock this listing down!"
,,,,,,,,Great room and stay! Friendly and clean!
,,,,,,,,Sarah had it all dialed in even though she was out of town. It was fun seeing the cat chilling around outside the house whenever I would come and go!
,,,,,,,,Sarah was an amazing host and the room was neat and clean. The location was very convenient and located in a cool neighborhood not far from downtown. Definitely would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a great host and lives in awesome hilltop house. Unfortunately, I did not have too much time to hang out, but would definitely come back."
,,,,,,,,"Sara and the home were really cool and inviting. Her cat and friends were equally warm with me and my boyfriend. I chose this location because it was in walking distance to my favorite Austin bookstore and record store. Conveniently there's a phone accessories store nearby too as I left my charging cable at home. Speaking of charging, Sara's home is filled with beautiful and energy-emanating stones and gems that recharge you after exploring Austin's great sights and foods. Sara's house is in a great location and next door to a tourist attraction, which is awesome butâ€”and this is the only drawbackâ€”parking was a little troublesome. Tip: if you find the street parking filled, wait a couple of minutes. People visit and leave rather quickly. I recommend Sara and her home wholeheartedly. :)"
,,,,,,,,The room was great and the house was very conveniently located in downtown Austin! Would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was great - professional, friendly, helpful, & handy around the house :). The house is clean & quiet, the location is perfect, & the price is just right.  5 stars with no hesitation!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Sarah's place! We parked right out front and almost mistaked the house for being part of the gallery, it's so close! Unfortunately Austin's heat and humidity made the door locking mechanism really difficult to open when we first arrived but some strategic moves got it open. The house was welcoming, common areas very tidy, and bathroom amenities were immaculate. The home was perfect for our short stay and I would definitely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is amazing and a must stay for anyone visiting Austin! This was my first time using Airbnb and my first time to Austin, and I couldn't have been any happier with my decision to stay at this house! Not only was the house beautiful and immaculate, Sarah was an incredibly gracious host. I traveled to Austin on my way to a business trip up north, and as a solo traveler, Sarah made sure I was comfortable and provided with me with great insights to the city. She even invited me out with her to explore more of Austin, which was a fantastic treat! 

The location of this place is also perfect! It's in a very nice neighborhood and centrally located to all of the great spots around the city.

Everything about my stay was wonderful, and I will absolutely stay here whenever I make it back to the city (hopefully soon)! "
,,,,,,,,"This place was great. Very comfortable, great location, and great communication. Sarah was very nice and gave me lots of advice on places to go, etc. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, next to a popular landmark. Sarah was awesome, and I loved her cat! Will defiantly use again if I am in Austin"
,,,,,,,,"Great stay in Austin. Dona was so friendly and helpful to us. The bed....wow. It is probably the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on. Highly recommend and we'll come back if we're traveling through Austin again. 

Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"WHAT. A. PLACE. Oh my goodness. From start to finish, top to bottom, this place and the whole experience was absolutely fantastic! So first and foremost -- again, thanks for hosting me this past weekend!

From the unbelievably descriptive, very clear ""welcome to Austin/my home"" guide, to the really cool electronic key that's based off a mobile app, to the location...just this place people--Worth. Every. Penny.

Alright, I'm done gushing...on to the details! 

The place was so clean, cozy, and easy to find. Close enough to people watch the folks checking out the HOPE Outdoor Gallery, but not enough for the steady traffic it attracts to in any way affect the hideaway feeling of the home, the place struck the perfect balance of between invigorating yet relaxing. The bedroom itself was huge and exactly as pictured, was the bed. Oh the bed! It was king-sized and just heavenly, made of some tempurpedic type material with the most comfortable sheets and down comforter. I promise you, every single night i slept SO well. Not to mention, the pillows were of varying firmness which suited my every need.

The bathroom was stocked with just about anything you could need: from shampoo and conditioner, to ibuprofen and bandaids, if you needed it or might, she had it (not to mention they were all quality products). The kitchen was the very same. And let me tell you, there was nothing quite like having fresh orange juice waiting on me in the morning after a night out on the town. Believe me.

And of course, I would be remiss to not rave about our phenomenal host. From the moment I lugged my belongings up the stairs, Dona made me feel right at home. Anything we needed, from recommendations to bug spray, she made sure we were always squared away and comfortable. Genuinely, I felt as though I was staying with an old friend rather than a complete stranger and i cannot wait to stay at this location again.

"
,,,,,,,,It was amazing staying here! The host was amazing and extremely welcoming. It was wonderful to be next to the grafiti park. The house was clean the bed was super comfy. This was my first air bnb experience and it was awesome and very close to 6th.
,,,,,,,,"This airbnb was absolutely perfect! Super close to downtown (We walked to sixth street at night) and literally right next for to one of the coolest places in Austin, Castle Hill.  The app to get into the house was super easy to use and great for going in and out. The host was away so we had the whole place to ourselves. Bathroom and shower were great and the bed was soon comfy. Would love to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was beautiful, room was great and as described. Me and my girlfriend had a lovely time and the location is perfect. Parking up the hill was the only downside as it is very steep and the other people staying in the house parked in the more convenient spot, but parking was available on the street at night time. "
,,,,,,,,"Lisa's place is truly an amazing property! Even though she was not there during our stay, she had everything coordinated for our arrival and it was hassle free. Her home was very clean and well kept. The location was my favorite part; her house is right next to the HOPE gallery as well as Lamar St. and a reasonable walk to all the happenings on 6th street. I would definitely not hesitate to stay here again, because it was nothing short of perfect. "
,,,,,,,,"Lisa was very responsive and accommodating.  The space is wonderful, well kept, and located right next door to the famous Hope Graffiti Wall, which was a fun treat.  Good breakfast right down the street.  Lisa is a gracious host! :-)"
15206637,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This is a great spot, super close to downtown and it's really a beautiful home. We only interacted with a management company via automated emails, but they were super efficient and informative. The place looks exactly like the photos - I'd definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,Thank you so much!!!  Great stay!!!
,,,,,,,,Clean and beautiful home! Top of the line interior decor and accommodations! Will return to this house if we come back to Austin! 
2332910,,10,10,10,10,10,7,"It is very close to convention center and all downtown hotels. Perfect for SXSW..Place was very clean and bed was so comfortable. Of course this is a small studio, sleeping only for events to be in the middle of everything. Roel was very nice and attentive, he fixed one light that was out quickly. He also asked us if we want anything from grocery. That was nice..thanks"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at the Executive Studio over SXSW in 2014. I cannot recommend the apartment and experience enough. Roel kindly met us at the airport and also gave us a lift back to the airport at the end of stay (very helpful as the taxi line was huge). 

Thanks to Roel and his wife the apartment was very clean and full of everything we would need including bathroom toiletries etc. However the best thing was the location. Ideally located by being situated very near to both the convention centre and 6th street. The building has a locked front gate so we always felt safe.

Communication with the Hosts was very prompt and they went out of our way to make sure we had a great stay, I left something behind in the apartment and they informed me asap and arranged for my belongings to be couriered to my next hotel. I would certainly stay again and would also recommend to anyone else I knew visiting Austin. Thanks for everything!"
5438705,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great quiet place to sleep but close to all the fun stuff in Austin! Parking spot was great to have and check in/out was super smooth. 
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place to stay in downtown Austin. Walkable to 6th Street & Rainey Street. Lot's of place to eat & explore nearby. Very nice place and the host is very communicative so no problems checking in or out. 
,,,,,,,,"If you are wanting to explore downtown Austin, John's place is DEFINITELY where you want to be. It is just two blocks from all of the fun on 6th Street and an easy drive to any of the other great spots in Austin like SoCo.  The thing we liked most about it was that it was downtown yet had private, gated parking.  The apartment sleeps 4 if you use the sleeper sofa and is very quiet. Along with many standard hotel type amenities, the place also has a washer and dryer.

If you are interested in a uniquely Austin experience, be sure to check out the Midnight Cowboy. It's a former brothel turned secret speakeasy where you can get an amazing handcrafted cocktail created right at your table. Reservations are highly recommended.

We will definitely return to Austin and will make every effort to stay at John's place."
,,,,,,,,Had a great time
,,,,,,,,"John's place is great. The location is very convenient, and the condo is super clean, and very well stocked. John is a very attentive host. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"John and Jenny were fabulous hosts and their condo is a great location downtown - an easy walk to anywhere you'd want to go downtown, and the bus stop to/from the airport across the street from the condo. "
,,,,,,,,"John and Jenny's place was such a good place to stay. It is very convenient if you want to walk to 6th and also just a 12 min walk to Rainey street. There's also so many restaurants around that are easily accessible so overall it was an ideal location. Jenny was very quick to respond and even extended our check out time as we requested. The place is just as how it looks in pictures and is very cozy, and they provided water, snacks and all the little necessities you would need which was awesome. We will definitely be booking here again on our next visit! "
,,,,,,,,"Jenny and John are great hosts. The communication was awesome and they responded within a few minutes to all my queries. They have maintained the apartment in an excellent conditions. The interiors decoration is beautiful. Quite artistic. The apartment location is excellent. Car park right outside the apartment !!!.. Walk-able to all the restaurants/bars around. For wine lovers, the Redroom lounge is just 1 minute walk from the apartment. Snacks, Trail mixes, Salsa and Refrigerator stocked with bottled water were a pleasant surprise.."
,,,,,,,,This was a great location and so close to the beautiful river with walking/running paths!  They had everything I needed and more!
,,,,,,,,"Hosts John and Jenny were GREAT!!!  They always responded to me right away. They were very helpful, nice and made our stay easy and pleasant. The apartment is in a PERFECT location and is decorated artistically and fun. The fridge was stocked with bottled water and they provided various snacks. I was pleasantly surprised to see those extras and definitely felt the southern hospitality. Having a gated place to park the car was a major plus. The unit is on the first floor and amongst other units so there aren't any views. That wasn't a big deal as all the important things were right on and I would highly recommend this place. Thank you John and Jenny"
,,,,,,,,"Great communication from Jenny.  Perfect location...not far to walk to everything, like the 6th street bars, tons of restaurants, and the Congress Ave bridge to see the bats. The condo is very clean, and the snacks and water were a nice surprise! Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. "
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is in a great location which was helpful to us attending a wedding a few blocks away. 
It is a quick walk from a 100 bus stop ($1.75 exact change one-way Airport shuttle) which was cheap, quick, and efficient.
The place was clean, cozy, and felt like home which we prefer when we travel.
Communication was very simple and we always received a quick response. John and Jenny provided bottled water, coffee, and a couple of snacks which were unexpected but also a lifesaver!
Because it was Halloween weekend there were a lot of festivities that went until early hours in the morning. We expect that is unique to the weekend and would still stay here again if we came to Austin. 
Definitely stay here - thank you Jenny and John!"
,,,,,,,,The place was awesome ! Off street parking is a plus! Complimentary snacks and a refrigerator full of water! Communication was great! We truly felt like guests! We hope to revisit this place in the future!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, beautiful fitted out apartment and looked after us as guests extremely well (with little snacks and a fully water stocked fridge- we were at home! thank you). Fantastic stay, would highly recommend to anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect. Location was ideal for what I needed. It's a few blocks from the CO River, scenic walks are always a plus when traveling. The snacks where great! I didn't have time to grab food on the way in so it kept the hanger away. 

Everything was clean and comfortable. The only down side is the upstairs neighbor is very heavy footed. Really though, not a big deal. This pad was a score. "
,,,,,,,,"Such a perfect space. I really can't say a bad thing about this experience. Jenny was so welcoming and communicative.   When we arrived at the unit the home was welcoming and had everything we need.  I don't have any plans to come back to Austin but if I do, I will certainly be contacting Jenny and John.  Thanks for a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at John's place while attending a tradeshow in downtown. The location is incredible, less than a 5 minute walk from the front door to the entrance of the convention center. I enjoyed the convenience of beautiful hiking and biking trail just down the street with of course all the attractions that downtown Austin has to offer. From food trucks, bars restaurants and more just around the corner and my own FREE parking spot that comes with the condo. I brought my bike with me on this trip and after arriving, parked my car and it didn't move until it was time to check out. Will stay again and recommend to any traveler!"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at this beautiful condo.  The location was great and the accommodations were incredible.  Jenny was very responsive and pleasant to work with.  When we visit Austin again, this will be our first choice to stay."
,,,,,,,,"John's place was amazing and Jenny let us know everything we needed to know - great location, clean, washing facilities as well as water, chips, salsa and trail mix provided as well! Would definitely recommend staying here, thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a lovely stay in Austin. The apartment was great, exactly like photos. John left lots of water and some yummy snacks which was great. The apartment is in a great location! If we are back in Austin we would love to stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location for the downtown conference I was attending,!and the communication up front was efficient and welcoming. The condo was clean, well decorated and comfortable. Great bed. The little extras - bottled water, chips, toiletries - were a nice touch, as was the parking space.  "
,,,,,,,,This condo is the best place to stay if you are trying to discover Austin. It is in a prime location and walking distance from popular destinations. The hosts were incredible welcoming and the entire place is spotless! 
,,,,,,,,Best air b&b I have stayed at ... Great location ! Very clean ! Easy communication with host ! Yummy snacks ! I will definitively stay here again when in ATX. 
,,,,,,,,Perfect location. Very clean and well taken care of place. Comes with a parking spot. The only negatives were the uncomfortable sofa bed (the second bed) and the strict 11am check out time. Other than those 2 things it was perfect. No noise issues. 
,,,,,,,,Place was just as described and in a wonderful location. The parking was a blessing as it's within walking distance to many places and parking is a premium! The hospitality was great with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"John and Jenny were great with communication & i associated that so much.  The apartment was absolutely beautiful & being right off 6th was awesome. The fact we had a covered, private parking spot was wonderful also. Lots of delicious goodies awaited us along with a fridge full of water. This was such a gem of a place & I can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,,,,"The condo is at an excellent location, very close to the convention center. It is very charming and fully equiped, being very confortable. Loved everything about it. The host was very helpful, responds fast to any questions and eveything went very smooth. I recommend it very much!"
,,,,,,,,"John and Jenny were awesome hosts and the apartment was extremely cute, very clean, and in a prime location to get to whichever part of Austin you want to go. Close walk to enjoy the craziness of 6th St, quaintness of Rainey, or the shopping of South Congress. "
,,,,,,,,"A fridge full of water! Yes! Plus a generous supply of snacks.  Shampoos, soaps, washer and dryer. In awe! Accommodated early check in request. Fabulous location!! Free wifi and cable. Covered, assigned parking space. Amazing place! Love, love location! Convenient to the lake hike and bike trails, sixth street, the Capitol building, South Congress, and UT. "
,,,,,,,,"The host made it very easy to get into the condo even though I arrived very late at night. The place was super clean, well decorated, with lights and A/C on. It was very welcoming with snacks, drinks, and toiletries available. It was a nice walk to get to the bars of 6th St and other local attractions."
,,,,,,,,"I was visiting Austin for the first time, and this Airbnb helped me feel right at home! It was centrally located (only 2 blocks from the infamous 6th St and within walking distance of most activities), well-kept, clean, and Austin-themed. In addition, the hosts left us food and water (which was much appreciated as it was 100 degrees most days), as well as toiletry items like soap and shampoo. I'm planning to book again the next time I'm in town! "
,,,,,,,,"We rented this unit while in town for a conference at the Austin Convention Center and it was SO conveniently located. The apt was clean and comfortable and stocked with high quality bathroom and cleaning products, not to mention tasty snacks :-) I would definitely choose this over downtown hotel rooms anytime!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place and location to stay. Would recommend any single person travelling to check out this listing. Place can comfortably fit two people and is low to the ground and pretty wheelchair accessible.

Important note is that this place has a laundry machine and dryer, very helpful when your stay is long or when you just need to wash your clothes."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent property with lovely amenities. We were visiting for a convention and the water, trail mix, and chips/salsa helped immensely along with all the toiletries. The A/C works great and the bed was super comfy. Host was also very accommodating with our early arrival time. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to staying in downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place!  We were attending a conference that was right across the street from this condo. 

If you hate hotels and want a relaxed setting, this is it!  The bedroom has an ensuite.  The closet is huge and includes a washer/dryer.  Snacks and lots of bottled water (a must for summers in Tx) was included.

The bed was extremely comfortable as was the entire condo.  It was just the right size for us.  It's walking distance to restaurants, surrounding hotels, and a fairly good size CVS.  

From now on, this is going to be my go-to place for downtown Austin.

Thanks, John, for a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Ein tolles Appartement mitten in Downtown. Es ist gepflegt, sauber und mit allem ausgestattet, was man braucht. Es gibt einen Privatparkplatz und ein gutes Wlan. Der Vermittler hat uns sogar mit Wasser und Snacks versorgt. Es liegen auch ReisefÃ¼hrer und Unternehmungsguide aus. Es war eine super Zeit, die wir dort hatten. Die Kommunikation  mit dem Besitzer war auch unkompliziert und schnell."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny & John were very responsive from the very beginning, I never had to wait long to get answers to my questions. The check in process was very smooth. We found everything wher Jenny said it was going to be. The condo itself - while the best thing about it is the location, John & Jenny have thought of everything : guide books, snacks, bottled waters, coffee, soap, shampoo - everything. It was clean, with full kitchen, a desk, a sofa and a chair, big screen TV. It was a nice space for the 2 of us. I had to work while I was there and the condo has fast internet. I definitely will come back to this condo again next year when visiting Austin. Thank you John & Jenny"
,,,,,,,,"It was a great stay! Right in the middle of downtown. Everything we wanted was in walking distance. Plenty of amenities and even provided us with snacks, coffee, and water. I would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay for Austin Convention Center, exit the side gate, cross the street and you are there. More convenient than any of the hotels!

The host was very accommodating with arrival needs. There is controlled access to the unit and very safe. 

I hope to stay here if every I need to attend an event at the Convention Center.

 "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great location for a conference in downtown Austin. Great communication with the host before the stay, easy entrance to the apartment and such hospitality with any toiletries I may have needed, chips and salsa and a fridge stocked with water and coffee. Thank you! If you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs as this is a street level garden style apartment and can get a bit noisy if the neighbors are out late or just moving around their unit in the middle of the night. Overall a great experience. "
,,,,,,,,"This experience was everything an Airbnb should be! The location is prime, the unit was absolutely spotless, there was every amenity I would need, and the host was very responsive. I was concerned the ground-level unit would be noisy, but the noise was minimal and fountain outside the unit provided white noise. I felt safe in this location as a woman traveling solo. Highly recommend this host and unit, and I look forward to staying there again!"
,,,,,,,,"John's agent was easy to deal with and quick to respond to any issues. The apartment was exactly as described, very neat and a cool place to stay. The location is excellent, right in the heart of downtown. Easily walkable."
,,,,,,,,"Host had plenty of snacks and waters available in the fridge. Plenty of towels and blankets as well. Host left clear instructions on wifi access, parking restrictions and expectations. "
,,,,,,,,One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. The host provided a lot of water bottles and chips and salsa. Smooth check in. Great stuff
,,,,,,,,"What a great experience! The apartment itself is lovely, with nice artwork and fun touches everywhere. The couch bed is as comfortable as any couch bed usually is, and the master bed is extremely comfortable. John left wonderful amenities for us like natural shampoos and conditioners, handmade Austin soaps, chips and salsa, coffee, and bottled water. The entire experience was GREAT and I would highly recommend renting the space with John. The location is perfect, the apartment complex feels safe, and the parking spot was so helpful. Thank you again John! You were a wonderful host :) "
,,,,,,,,Very nice and cozy apartment next to the convention center. John makes you feel home right away and makes your Texan experience pretty pleasant.
,,,,,,,,"John was quick with responding to communications and left very clear  instructions on parking, etc.  The condo was very nice, loved the colors and decorations.  We very much appreciated the wonderful selection of trail mix, chips and salsa and bottled water.  There was a great selection of books, maps and information about Austin and the Hill Country area.  The location can't be beat if you are attending an event at the convention center.  Although we were downtown I felt very safe.  Having reserved parking was fantastic.  "
,,,,,,,,"The hosts were excellent in preparing us for arrival and the apartment was great. Centrally located, clean, artsy and very pleasant furniture, bed and surroundings.  Recommend without reservation for any visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This was an amazing experience! John went above and beyond to make me enjoy my stay. The trail mix, chips and salsa, etc were a really nice touch and actually came in very handy a few times. I was blown away to find a handwritten welcome note and fresh cut flowers when I arrived. The home was extremely clean and comfy. I do not know how anyone could find a better place to stay.  The washer and dryer was a nice convenience I did not anticipate either. Absolutely suggest staying here."
,,,,,,,,"We had very enjoyable time in Austin.  The condo was as described, clean and a perfect location for us.  I had a conference at the convention center which is steps from the front door.  The only downside had nothing to do with the condo, but to the loud groups staying in the same complex.  The walls are a little thin for 2am crazies.  Thanks for your hospitality!  mark"
,,,,,,,,"John and Jenny were great hostesses!  They were gracious enough to allow us to drop off our bags in the morning though check in wasn't until much later in the day.  Every text message and email were responded to promptly!  

There were snacks, coffee and water left for our use!  There were even fresh flowers to make us feel at home! The place is decorated really 'cool' with 60's and 70's stuff including a record player!  The condo is located a few blocks off of 6th street and totally walkable to South Congress.  Would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"John's place was the absolute perfect location for our Sxsw weekend.  Although we dealt entirely with Jenny (property manager) I could not have asked for a more hospitable stay.  She was easy to contact, responsive, and incredibly helpful.  We arrived to snacks, coffee and a fridge stocked with plenty of water. The apartment was quirky and cozy and altogether amazing.  The bed is comfortable, there were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and the washer and dryer turned out to be very convenient for us.  I lived in Austin for 5 years and I can honestly say that this location is absolute prime for any first time visitor.  We were within walking distance of both east and west downtown which was a blessing during this very busy weekend.  We parked our car in the provided parking spot and walked to the best restaurants, bars, and shows, never once requiring an Uber. There were only two of us, but with the pull out couch I think this would be comfortable for up to 4 people for a long weekend.  As such I highly recommend you consider John's place for your next Austin adventure!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was just as promised.  We were there during SXSW, so we expected the area to be lively and loud well into the early morning...and it was.  The unit was well equipped and the process was smooth. Excellent communication with Jenny.  "
,,,,,,,,"I had a fabulous time in Austin! While the city is great and the conference was excellent, the hospitality, comfort, apartment location, and goodies left by John, made it even better. If you are looking for a warm, comfortable, fabulous location apartment while in Austin, look no further. John is great!!"
,,,,,,,,"Jenny and John were extremely easy to work with and stayed in constant contact before and during our trip. The apartment was nicely sized, spotless and comfortable. A few blocks from the nightlife on 6th street and easy walk everywhere else. The only downside to the trip was the building itself. It is extremely noisy, the sounds in the halls carry through the windows like they were open. Also the other ""residents"" were quite raucous until 3am+ which made for long night. If you are looking for all night party atmosphere then maybe not  big deal - but be aware if you are a quiet getaway it may not be the right place."
,,,,,,,,"John was an excellent host and very accommodating with our schedule.  The downtown apartment was the perfect location to explore multiple areas in Austin, all in walking distance.  I would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"Unbelievable place, couldn't ask for anything else. Location superb. Cleaniness excellent. All the amenities listed are true and then some....I travel for business and this is my new Austin home for work and play."
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is in a perfect location for anything you could want to do in Austin!  Walk to 6th Street for the music and sights, or to Rainey Street area bars. There is a dedicated parking space too! 

John (and Jenny) left water, coffee and snacks for us and great Austin related books and maps that helped us get oriented before we began exploring the city. 

Loved having a washing machine and dryer as we like to workout and we could do our laundry! 

The bed was comfy and the living room was spacious. The bathroom was well stocked with plenty of towels and soaps. It was like coming home every time we walked in. 

As other reviewers mentioned there is some noise from the walkway but nothing that bothered us at all. 

The coffee pot cracked one morning and within two hours John had delivered a brand new unit!! 

This was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn't be happier with choosing this condo. We would stay again if we ever get back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great experience - very responsive throughout the booking process. The apartment is cute and quirky - loved that there was a record player. Above and beyond that they provided bottles of water, snacks and toiletries! Only downfall is that it did get pretty loud at night because the apartment is right at the condo entrance - something to be aware of if you don't plan on going out on a weekend night."
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is perfect for anyone heading to downtown Austin or the convention center.  The unit is very close to an exit and to the covered parking space.  (The parking space is pretty tight, but my SUV was fine in it.)  Downtown hotels can charge up to $40 a night for parking, so factor that into this location if you're bringing a car.  John (and Jenny) are excellent hosts.  They provide a great little place, left plenty of great Austin-related materials to peruse, and a filled the fridge with bottled water.  The record player was a nice touch---several of my favorite LPs were there to spin, such as The Beatles, ELP, and John Coltrane.  The bed was comfy and the bathroom was accommodating.  The couch was inviting and the large laundry room/walk-in closet was a nice surprise!

John and Jenny were very accommodating when our plans slightly changed, forcing us to check out a little later than originally scheduled.  They're great folks, and you won't be sorry if you book this place!"
,,,,,,,,John was an excellent host and Austin is a great town. Would definitely come back!
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was really exceptional, and John was incredibly helpful.  I have used Airbnb for many years and this was one of those ""pleasant surprises"" on all fronts.  Great location, clean, easy to communicate with host, etc.  I couldn't recommend it more."
,,,,,,,,"John was a great host and the apartment was well taken care of. It was easy to get a hold of him to schedule check-in and check-out, and he was flexible when I added an extra traveller at the last minute. The apartment came stocked with snacks, bottled water, and coffee, which was a nice touch. There is some noise in the apartment from the walkway adjacent to the bedroom and living room, as other reviewers note, but nothing too bothersome. All told, a great price and experience. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was well kept and as described in the post. Very clean and the host left water and snacks which was great and extremely generous. 

Pros: clean, nice washer and dryer, great location, free gated parking

Cons: water was cold one night, apartment complex was extremely loud, there is a really annoying fountain outside the unit which operates 24-7, the rollout couch is anything but comfortable

We stayed right after Christmas so the rates were increased. I think we payed too much for the stay but we booked late so options in Austin were limited. "
,,,,,,,,Nice comfortable space that is located in the heart of down Austin. Convenient for those who are looking to experience the Capitol of the great state of Texas. Jon was gracious enough to allow me to utilize his space everything was nice and clean and all his products were environmentally friendly. He is a great host!
,,,,,,,,"Awesome Place! We went to Austin and wanted to be downtown within a short walking distance from the night life.
We really enjoyed walking over to 6th street and listening to the live bands. There were a bunch of restaurants close by and we really only drove when we went up to Lake Travis and across town.
I would definitely stay here again.
Other good things:
Gated covered parking.
Lots of bottles of cold water in the refrigerator.
Clean comfortable place.
Lot and lots of towels!
Location, location, location!
Comfortable queen size bed.
Good coffee in the freezer! And a Starbucks right across the street!
The host was very responsive to any question we had. Awesome!

Overall a nice quiet place to stay and enjoy Austin from!"
,,,,,,,,John and Jenny were easy to contact and communicate with. Accessing the apartment was also made simple and had a private parking spot. Location was very safe and secure. Of course the best part of the apartment was the location!  You will not find a better location to explore downtown Austin.  Overall a great experience!
,,,,,,,,"John was a wonderful host.  He left snacks out for us, more towels than we could possibly use, locally produced soap.  He also apparently looked me up on the internet, because he left records of Indian music waiting out for me, as well! Thanks, John.  "
,,,,,,,,Condo was in a great location - close proximity to downtown Austin. Was very comfortable and having a washer/dryer and car park was an added bonus. The apartment was perfect for us (a couple). The host gave us entry information well in advance - was all very clear and easy to follow. Thoroughly enjoyable stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Overall we were very happy with our experience. John and Jenny were great hosts. We had absolutely no trouble getting into the apartment on our first night and they made it clear that we could reach out to them at any time if we had trouble. 

The apartment is in an incredibly convenient location. My wife and I used to live in Austin and the location was the main reason we selected this apartment. Walking distance to a whole host of bars and restaurants.

Our only complaint about the apartment was that it's located in the center of a fairly dark apartment complex. If you chose to leave the blinds open the whole world would be able to see in, but with them closed the place was pitch black even in the middle of a beautiful sunny day. Not a big deal considering we weren't in town to just hang around the house, but something to consider if you plan on staying.
"
,,,,,,,,"The aparment is really well located: it's one street from the convention center and in walking distance to downtown attractions.
There is aircon/heater, washing machine and everything you will need to feel comfortable.
The host is also flexible for check-in and check-out!"
,,,,,,,,Fresh flowers and ample lights were on upon arrival. There was more than enough water and home supplies. The washer and dryer were an added plus. It was a great place to stay and listen to good music which was readily available. 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment and location were exactly what I needed while at a nearby conference in downtown Austin.  It's an easy walk to 6th street and 4th street entertainment districts with many restaurants and bars in between.  John was a great host, providing plenty of water and snacks.  The apartment is clean, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning efficient.  I will make sure to check the apartment availability the next time I'm in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is great!  The location was perfect.  The place was a great size, clean and really cute.  John made everything easy and even left us little treats which was extremely thoughtful.  We arrived a little early and they were very accommodating.  I hope this place is available for our next trip back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed for seven nights, and everything was great. John was very helpful leading up to our trip with any questions and we felt very welcome once we arrived. Since we stayed for Halloween, the condo even had some decorations up. Perfect location for downtown. Overall, a great place to stay for a much better rate than all of the surrounding hotels."
,,,,,,,,Host made us feel welcome. He was very accommodating. He answered any questions we had. Location was perfect. We could not have asked for a better spot. 
,,,,,,,,"We spent two nights in Austin and could not have had a better place to stay. The location was perfect. Two blocks from 6th street, and within walking distance of the capital and university.  The apartment was clean and well stocked. If we had been there longer I would have loved to play some of his vinyl. I would recommend highly to anyone wanting an affordable, convenient, place to stay in Austin.   "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay here was great!  Central location, John left everything we would need and then some!  Snacks, bottled water, even postcards of historic Austin as a ""party favor"" :)  It was comfortable and perfect for 2 of us to share.  Communication was quick and clear, access was easy, etc...  I would Definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Convenient place, simple process with John."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed in this condo for second weekend of ACL. It was in a perfect area for everything- a quick walk to Rainey st, 6th St and a short peddy cab ride to Zilker Park. The condo is quaint, a little small for any larger group than 4 but was perfect for my sister and I. John was very helpful and prompt in answering questions. I would definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Extremely friendly and accommodating hosts.  The place was ""cozy"" but perfectly clean, well stocked with water and snacks, and quiet!  Recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, John provided plenty of water and snacks and was very easy to work with."
,,,,,,,,The apartment was located in the heart of Downtown Austin. Excellent location. John was very welcoming and helpful. Great air B and B!
,,,,,,,,Johns place was perfect for what I needed during murine in Austin. The instructions that were left for me were easy to follow and the extra little snacks and beverages were a great bonus. If I was ever in Austin again I would try and stay longer. Thanks John!
,,,,,,,,"Great central location.  Good for seeing the entire city of Austin in a weekend.  Apartment itself is great.  All the amenities (towels, soap, coffee, etc.) included.  Very clean.  Also enjoyed a couple songs on the record player!  As others have stated, the building can be a little noisy at night, but overall, it was not an issue for us.  100% would stay with again, and this gets my recommendation."
,,,,,,,,"John was very friendly and welcoming. He allowed us to drop off our luggage before the check in time because our flight came in early and they had not finished cleaning. The place was as described and perfect for a short stay in Austin.

Pros:
The location is really great. We were in town for a wedding and all our friends were staying at the Hilton and we were right next door. I liked how the buidling was secure with a gate. It was really walkable to everything and easy to grab a cab if needed.

John left us some snacks and lots of bottled water which was much appreciated and needed in Austin. The place was clean with plenty of amenities.

The air conditioning was much needed and worked very well.

Cons:
The first floor got kind of noisy at night with people walking by and talking when they were going in or out. The upstaoirs neighbor stomps when they walk so that is loud as well at night.
The water in the shower NEVER got hot.. not even warm. It was semi nice if you came in from a hot summer day and went immediately into the shower but if not it was really hard to take a shower.
"
,,,,,,,,"Incredible location, great space, very friendly and informative host, not to mention one of the coolest cities I've visited! Will definitely recommend, and will definitely visit again soon!"
,,,,,,,,Great location and nice apartment!  I felt very welcomed walking in the door.  Parking spot is awesome!  I had a great stay...
,,,,,,,,"I had communicated with John or his sister a few times before going there.  They were excellent in communication and made our arrival smooth.  We were arriving around midnight, they told us how to enter, where to get the key, and where to leave the key after we leave.  We were leaving about 5am.  

Overall, they were gracious and excellent communicator.  I would recommend to stay with them again. "
,,,,,,,,The place was in a prime downtown location close to all the great things Austin has to offer. The condo was beautiful and comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,"What a cute little place! It was perfect for us as our event was at the convention center. Very clean, secure, and close to everything. Loved that they left water and trail mix for us. Shower get great and the bed was very comfortable. Hope to stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful experience with John and Jenny! They went out of their way to make sure that we were always: informed, prepared and taken care of. They answered questions promptly and always made themselves available if we needed anything. Beyond that, the condo was absolutely perfect and stocked by John and Jenny for anything that we could need. They even provided snacks and water to welcome us! The location was truly perfect - close to downtown for walking and close to I35 for driving anywhere. Everything was simple and taken care of - we simply can't say enough about the condo and our hosts - wonderful!!
"
,,,,,,,,"John's place was perfect. Nice and close to east sixth street and all the other main areas. His apt. Is right next to all the high end hotels where you would easily pay over $200 a night. The apt itself was great, nice and clean and a fridge stocked with cold water.
Everything was perfect."
,,,,,,,,"Nice clean, simple apartment in great location, just as advertised.  Well-stocked with cold water in the fridge and a variety of toiletries - soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, etc.. - available in the bathroom.  

John and the leasing manager Jenny were both extremely responsive and helpful.  "
,,,,,,,,"John's apartment was the perfect location and set-up for a quick trip to Austin. It was an excellent location in downtown Austin, super convenient to many things (rainey st., the river trails, etc.). I was able to walk most of the time I was there. John was super flexible and accommodating when it came to check in. The apartment itself is on the smaller side, but it was completely fine for a few days. The only thing I would note about it is that it is located on the first floor of a two story complex, so there were times at night where I could hear the upstairs neighbors moving around. Also, the bath/shower were a little outdated/not much hot water, but it wasn't a huge deal for a two-day trip. Overall, I had a very positive experience and would definitely consider renting from John again next time I'm in town. "
,,,,,,,,John was awesome and we really enjoyed our stay.
,,,,,,,,"John was an excellent host and we really enjoyed our time in his place. The pictures and description were perfect. We were within walking distance of pretty much everything we wanted to experience and the complex was easy to get in and out of both by car and when walking around. The books on Austin and record player were a nice addition and the coffee and bottled water were much appreciated. If you're looking for a location where you can park your car for the weekend and wander the city, this is definitely it. It was great to get a whole apartment for less than we would have paid for a room at a hotel. Thanks John!"
,,,,,,,,"John made us feel welcome and gave us a complete orientation. His place is very nice and centrally located. Everything you need was there, including toiletries and information on the area.
Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Love the central location which allowed me to walk everywhere. The ice cold bottled water in the fridge was a nice amenity in the hot Austin weather. Great attitude and hospitality from the host and he even gifted me an Austin post card. 

It's located on the ground floor, next to the complex entrance, so may be a little noisy at night as people return from various nighttime activities. "
,,,,,,,,"My colleague and I had a fantastic stay at the apartment. It is walkable to so many great bars and restaurants and John could not have been more helpful with the arrival logistics. 

The cold bottled water in the fridge was a really nice amenity too. I would stay at the apartment again in a heartbeat! "
,,,,,,,,"John was extremely welcoming. He greeted us when we arrived and he let us drop our stuff off early since we arrived early while the apartment was still being cleaned. The apartment is just like how it looks in pictures. It is VERY clean and everything is just perfect. I must say the apartment location is absolutely PERFECT. My fiancÃ© and I walked everywhere we needed to go (no rental car needed) and took an Uber to a few restaurants in the evening that were a little farther outside of Austin. 

John was also extremely accommodating when we got stuck in Austin an extra night with the horrible storms that were happening. He let us stay since no one was coming in the next day. He really saved us from having to get a hotel room for more than double the price for one night. 

We will ABSOLUTELY try to stay here again on our next visit to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"John met us at the front of the complex upon our arrival and showed us around the apartment and the parking lot. He was very nice and helpful.

The apartment was just as pictured online. It had everything you would need - towels, washer/drier, coffee and coffeemaker, and lots of bottled water in the fridge.

It is in amazing location - right next to the convention center and within walking distance of 6th Street and Rainey Street. We had a great time!

My only critique is that noise level of the apartment. The bedroom bedroom is right up against a main hallway that echos quite a bit. Both nights we stayed there, we were woken up several times in the night by people making noise in the hall. I recommend bringing ear plugs."
,,,,,,,,My stay at the condo in Austin was perfect. The place was exactly what I was looking for  and close to everything downtown. I didn't get a chance to meet John and Lesley. But they communicated very well via text and email. When I'm ever back in Austin I will look here first.
,,,,,,,,"My fiancÃ© and I had a wonderful stay at this condo! It was clean, spacious and wonderfully decorated. We felt right at home! There were waters in the fridge when we arrived and toiletry samples in the bathroom for us to use during our stay. I cannot tell you how incredible the location is! Right in the heart of it all! Even better was that we were able to use the unit's parking space in the lot behind the building. Parking in the area can be a challenge but we had no worries since we had a protected place to park. The unit sits at one of the entrances to the building so it does get noisy on the weekend as people enter and exit the building. It's definitely manageable as I used earplugs the second night. No big deal! 5 star stay! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location - was literally 4 blocks from where our conference was located; super easy to walk.  Also 1 block from metro train and airport flyer bus stop.  Place was very clean, John met us in person to show us around and stocked the fridge with plenty of bottled water (Very nice!).  It looks exactly like this picture - very cute and welcoming! "
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I had a great time staying at John (and Jenny's) in downtown Austin. They were quick to respond to any questions we had about the condo and the surrounding area. John met us at the condo and had the place clean from top to bottom. He left waters in the frig and coffee we could make. The apartment has just about everything you would need - towels, hair dryer, washer/dryer, TV with cable, etc. The complex is secure from the public with a fob entry which was comforting (even though we felt safe in the area). The location is perfect for walking anywhere downtown - just a few blocks from 6th Street, Rainey St, and Congress. If we go back we will definitely book with John!"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location and really affordable for what you get.  John (who was immediately responsive to all inquiries) met us upon arrival with Coltrane on the record player.  The place is cosy and clean and amenities like nice soaps, bottled water and coffee were unexpected and very appreciated.  Location can't be beat for getting around a lot of the fun stuff by foot.  One thing: we stayed over a weekend and there were a LOT of young people also staying in the building clearly there to hit 6th and have a good and drinky time - the nightly 2:30am parade of them LOUDLY coming home directly next to the bedroom window was a bummer.  Bring ear plugs (or stay out that late yourself! :) "
,,,,,,,,"Description was accurate, and hosts were very friendly.  Quite enjoyed my stay - apartment had everything you could possibly need, and felt very private.  "
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience here! The location is great for 6th Street and Rainey Street. SoCo was only about $6 using Ãœber but can be walked to if you don't mind a work out. There's plenty of places to eat and drink at in the area. The condo was spotless and modern! It was stocked with any household item you would need and the fridge even had bottles of water. John and Jenny were a pleasure to deal with and were so easy to get in touch with. This condo was the perfect place to stay for two people! 
,,,,,,,,Great host with lots of good tips on the area.  For the area the condo was very affordable.  It could be a little cleaner with just a little extra attention but it was more just dusty than dirty.  Also the windows let all sounds in so it's a little loud at night. 
2010358,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This little spot was really sweet. We didn't spend a lot of time there, just to sleep and shower, although it has a fully equip kitchen and a considerably large TV! Our biggest problem was with regulating the temp when we were sleeping because the bed is elevated and is the hottest part of the space. Didn't realize until we were leaving that the couch downstairs folds out! The shower also doesn't have great pressure or too much hot water but it didn't really bother us all that much, we were kind of in camping mode. All in all, it was a nice little place to come back to every night and became our home away from home. "
,,,,,,,,"Great stay, loved the location. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Great tiny house just outside of downtown Austin.  Very quiet neighborhood with great food, coffee, and drinks within walking distance.  "
,,,,,,,,The tiny house is simple but has everything you need.  We loved the neighborhood as there were some great restaurants that were within just a block or two.  
,,,,,,,,"Tiny House was as described and shown in pictures. I enjoyed staying in such a unique place without sacrificing any typical conveniences. Location was good, safe. Away from the nightlife but within walking distance (especially on a nice night). Easy street parking, access, and communication. Sean provided me recommendations beforehand and was responsive when I had questions. Bed is comfortable, heat/ac as needed, I definitely recommend staying at Tiny House and will stay if I am back in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Good for pokemon, anyone who likes to walk around. I didn't see anything in the listing about an elementary school being right next door but except for the daily recess it wasn't an issue. The shower was about the size of a baseball diamomd. This place is great if you want to be especially close to your traveling buddy."
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house is just what they say. Easy living at its finest. Not to far from airport, not to far from downtown. Very good places to eat a stone's throw away. "
,,,,,,,,This is as described a tiny house giving you a nice base to explore Austin. It is in a nice neighborhood with a 20 min walk to the bar district of W. 6th. 
,,,,,,,,"Truly enjoyed my time in the tiny house. It was perfect for my stay. Loved having a little kitchenette for coffee and breakfast in the morning. They even provided coffee which I wasn't expecting. It was very clean and exactly as pictured.
I like to walk as much as possible so I found the 25 minute walk to downtown fine and felt safe exploring the area alone. 
The binder of tips about Austin was great and gave me a few more ideas of places to check out. And it was nice to have a list of grocery stores/cafes etc that are close.
This spot is great for someone traveling alone. Might be a little tight for two but still accommodating. If I ever head back to Austin I'll try to grab this place again. Loved it."
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Sean were exceptional hosts, the tiny house was exactly as pictured and described - perfect for walking to ACL at Zilker Park - and we were provided with a terrific guidebook for our stay.  I can't say enough about this lovely, immaculate home.  I would be thrilled to stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"I've never stayed in a tiny house before and it took some getting used to. The location was great and the host was responsive. It did get hot sleeping up so high, but there was a small fan to help. Overall good experience and would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,The accurately-described tiny house was perfect! The space was super efficient and clean. The location was perfect for meetings and dinners in downtown Austin. Street parking was a breeze. I'll definitely stay there again.
,,,,,,,,Super easy to get in and out. Wonderful location. 
,,,,,,,,Brad was an excellent host and responded quickly to any questions I had. He truly went out of his way to make sure my boyfriend and I were comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was awesome overall! Great price and very safe neighborhood. There's restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance. While the bikes aren't the best, they do the job to get you from point A to B. Super close to downtown--we were able to walk everywhere--even though it was hot as all get out! "
,,,,,,,,"We did not meet Sean during our stay, but he was a helpful and communicative host. There was a binder in the house with useful info about the neighborhood, recommendations on what to do in Austin, and tips about the tiny house itself. The house is adorable, and very comfortable for two people. There is plenty of street parking available if you have a car, and the neighborhood is safe and very close to downtown. We had a great time!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb reservation and what a great first experience! (Hotel costs were on the high side which is why I went the Airbnb route).  The TH was like my little checkpoint all weekend and it was very quiet and quaint with just enough space to get ready in. It sits in a backyard which is separated from the home owners space.  The TH was clean, surprisingly spacious enough for my liking, and I slept great in the secluded loft.  I ended up traveling alone so I didn't want to venture too far from the property and there was many available restaurants in walking distance.  Host provided local (Clarksville) recommendations which were all excellent!  I recommend staying here if you're not looking to spend much time inside! "
,,,,,,,,"Tiny House had everything we were looking for in a place â€” a clean, safe spot to rest our heads and store our stuff while we went out exploring. The host made our arrival and departure super easy, and everything went very smoothly."
,,,,,,,,We had a great time here and would recommend it to anyone.
,,,,,,,,"Quaint little spot in a quiet downtown neighborhood, we really enjoyed our stay."
,,,,,,,,This Airbnb was probably the most tiniest I've lived in so far and it had everything I needed. I loved my stay here. Everything was clean and cosy. Nothing to complain about. 
,,,,,,,,The place was very tidy when we got there and Brad was very responsive and helpful. Wonderful place!
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was awesome! The house is definitely small but it worked perfectly for 2 people. There are lots of shops and cafes around the neighborhood within walking or biking range so you don't have to deal with Austin's parking. We took advantage of brads bike offer ($20 for 2 bikes for the whole weekend), and they weren't the best bikes but they were good for getting us around town. Overall, highly recommend staying at the tiny home!"
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house is just that... its real tiny and perhaps smaller than you think. It sits in the backyard of the owner (I assume its the owner). Austin is somewhat expensive so if your on a budget and plan to stay in the area without a car, it might be right for you. No more than 2 people max as the tiny house has limited space and small closet to only hang clothes otherwise you'll live out of your suitcase. The memory foam mattress was comfortable but the ladder to access the loft sort of get in your way. It is noted that the stove is inoperable so its a microwave and a small refrigerator. That's ok because there are many places within 3 blocks to eat out and get a snack or get a few grocery items to keep in the room. The neighborhood is nice and quaint. The bicycles.... nice to get to Zilker park and around the neighborhood but they are a little cumbersome with one speed and its a little hilly in Austin with a one speed bicycle. We found that ride share services such as FARE were very good and about $10 each to downtown. The window AC unit was great to have as it was 100 degrees during our stay."
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house is indeed tiny, but really cool and thoroughly thought. It's comfortable, has everything you need and is clean. The neighborhood is quiet and a good distance from downtown. Brad also leaves  tips about the house as well as touristic information about Austin. He responds super fast and was nice and easy-going. Definitely  would recommend staying there! Great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"The process of booking the stay was fast and easy. The tiny house was fun to stay in, and perfect for 1-2 people. Everything was neat and clean, and the guides/maps provided in the tiny house were very helpful. It truly felt like a hotel stay. The area around the house is a quiet residential area, but there are a few cafes, restaurants, and a grocery store within 1-2 blocks. It's also a few blocks from 6th street and a nice run to Zilker park and the trails. Overall it was a great, no-hassle experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Really fun experience and located in a great, quiet neighborhood"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay!  I got into Austin long before check-in and they got the place cleaned so was able check-in two hours early!  They also have an extensive list of recommendations of places to eat and things to do!  I didn't use the bikes, but I thought that was a great addition.  Austin is a very biker friendly city.  The tiny house is a little far from the bar scene, which might be good or bad depending what you are there for.  I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,The place was great. Tiny house was a good description but it was very comfortable. It is located in a good part of the city with some nearby restaurants and a very short drive to 6th avenue. I did rent the bikes but found them difficult since a lot of the locations I went to like 6th Avenue didn't have easy to navigate bike paths and the brakes were a little dificult. Overall though I would recommend this listing!
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at the tiny house! Brad was so wonderful and gave us the best recommendations on what to do in the city. He was extremely thorough and spot-on with his suggestions! We would highly recommend staying here. Do note, however, this house is VERY tiny! It was perfect for us, as we were planning on being out-and-about all day, but if you are planning on spending some time inside, note that the house is very small and becomes packed very quickly when you put your luggage down.
All in all, great experience, would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay in the tiny house! The place was very clean and exactly as described. It had everything I needed and more. Brad and Gwen left a detailed listing of recommendations (food, attractions, coffee, etc.) which was very helpful. Also, the house is in a great location - walking distance to downtown, some great restaurants, grocery / convenience stores, bars, and a bus stop. Brad and Gwen also
made themselves available to field any questions I had or additional recommendation requests. I would recommend staying in the tiny house and I would stay there again! "
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were in Austin for a wedding and stayed at the tiny house for a few nights. The location is perfect: close to downtown and even closer to some great restaurants and bars, while still being a safe quiet neighborhood. We don't have a car and were perfectly fine walking to most places, and using Uber for the rest. It definitely is a tiny house, which worked out perfectly for us (a couple with not too much luggage). 

Also, I cannot say enough good things about the host Brad and his wife Gwen. They were both so accommodating, kind and helpful. They checked in with us regularly and offered plenty of recommendations. 

The tiny house is the perfect place to stay to really experience Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was the perfect crashing pad for a wedding weekend in Austin. Wonderful location, clean set up, nice outdoor space, and Brad and Gwen were gracious hosts. Would definitely stay there again. x"
,,,,,,,,"Brad and his wife Gwen were lovely hosts. Very easy to communicate with and very accommodating. The Tiny House was comfortable and clean - exactly as pictured. Located in a quiet neighborhood with good food and shopping within walking distance and just a quick Uber or cab ride from downtown. I was in town for a conference, not late nights out so this worked perfect for me - highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfectly clean and quiet, in a cute and safe neighborhood. I hope to stay there again sometime!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful time in the Tiny House. It was very comfortable for a single short term rental. It would be equally nice for two. The hosts answered my few questions promptly and host, Gwen, was very friendly when we met. The neighborhood is cute and walking distance (for regular walkers) from downtown and the Capitol. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"Brad was an awesome host!  He and his wife Gwen were very good at communicating with me as we prepared for our arrival to Austin.  Once at the tiny house Brad's wife Gwen kept in contact with us and was very helpful giving suggestions of places to eat, drink, and sight see.
The tiny house looked exactly like the pictures and had everything we needed.  The neighborhood and its location to the city was awesome. 
I would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were in Austin for his performance for SXSW 2016, and his birthday. Our stay at the tiny house was nothing less than fantastic. Cute doesn't even begin to describe it. The place is quite small but perfect and comfortable for two people. It is conveniently located just blocks from W 6th Street, which is a short walk, or a shorter ride on bicycle. There is a Whole Foods on N Lamar Blvd, which is also a short distance away. The area is residential and quiet, with much to do and explore. 

Let's not forget to mention that Brad and Gwen were amazing hosts! Anything that you need or may have a question about, they are always available to help. Prior to arrival, they provided a detailed message with of the information that you need to stay at their place. Within the tiny house you can find a print out with more information. They made us feel at home and relaxed, considering the madness around the city for SXSW.

I would highly recommend staying at the Tiny House!"
,,,,,,,,"Tiny House is located about 2 miles from Austin Convention Center (a $5 Uber/Lyft ride) in a really nice part of town with lots of restaurants, upscale shops, and a giant Whole Foods. It really IS tiny, but has all the essentials: bathroom, closet, couch, TV, bed, outlets, wifi (not the fastest but fine for email or (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)), heater, AC. The bathroom was stocked with towels and soap, fresh sheets on the bed, everything was spotless.

Getting in and out of bed can be a bit tricky, Iâ€™ll be honest - you have to turn off the lights by the kitchen, then climb up in the dark using a ladder illuminated by a tiny LED lantern. Sleeping in the loft felt a bit like a Japanese capsule hotel. But it worked out fine and I consider myself very lucky to have booked the Tiny House.

Brad was very quick to respond to my reservation inquiry and the transaction was a breeze. My hosts made themselves readily available and were very friendly the entire length of my stay. Upon arrival, I was greeted with delicious cranberry orange scones and a tiny bottle of prosecco. They left a list of all their favorite places to shop and eat nearby, which was really handy. All in all, a great place to crash during SXSW and I would stay here again if traveling to Austin by myself."
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying in the tiny house! It was exactly as it was described - super clean and while everything was compact, it didn't feel claustrophobic or cramped. Brad and Gwen are great hosts and made sure I had everything I needed. For a different kind of experience at a place to stay, I highly recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,"While the house is tiny as advertised, it has everything you could need and is clean and comfortable. Great location, close to many coffee shops, restaurants and stores. Brad and Gwen were accommodating and available as needed. Bikes were a great way to explore the city. "
,,,,,,,,"Okay, so this place is a real gem. Brad and Gwen are so friendly, their property is ADORABLE and the location is safe, comfortable and pretty. Their recommendations for local restaurants were great and I went to several of them and was not disappointed. The space is impeccably clean and the bed is amazingly comfortable. You should stay here. You won't regret it."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in the Tiny House.  It was nice to be slightly outside of the hustle-bustle of downtown and get to explore a neighborhood that we probably wouldn't have seen otherwise.  (And, yes, there are lots of great cafes, restaurants, and even a pharmacy within a 5 minute walk!)  Brad and his family were very hospitable, offering helpful suggestions for places to eat and how to get around.     "
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were the ideal hosts. No complaints, with a seamless check-in and check-out. Super-close to downtown in a quaint little neighborhood, the location would be hard to beat. We loved the tiny house experience, it was clean, modern, and complete with everything we needed."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin and in the Tiny House was such a great experience! The house itself is very cute and perfect for two people to comfortably stay in. The location of the house was great, walkable distance to many good food joints, and a good neighborhood. We used the bikes to get around and see the city which was so convenient since Austin is such a bikeable city.

Brad and his wife were great hosts, they gave us many suggestions for things to do and places to eat, all of which were great recommendations. We had such a great stay here and can't wait to come back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"WOW! This place was just awesome. Brad and Gwen thought of absolutely every detail. If you're a neat freak, I think you'll be very impressed with how immaculately kept the tiny house is. The hosts were accommodating and super friendly. I was booking in a bit of a hurry and hadn't done much research about the location other than the fact that the area is very safe according to Trulia. When I got there, I realized that it's actually the most ideal location if you're looking to explore the city or if, like me, you need to be at the Convention Center. I never paid more than a $5 Uber or Lyft to get anywhere in the city and the bikes were super handy since Austin is so bike-friendly. The bikes are pretty comfy, definitely recommend using them to bike around town if you like to explore. 6th street was a short walk around the corner, and all the neat bars, restaurants and shops of Old West Austin are right up the street. Since you're in between the two areas, it's actually nice and quiet too. I walked to the store that is .3 miles away by myself around 10pm and felt totally safe. A friend staying in the city saw my Airbnb and actually relocated to be closer to the area. The bed was super comfy and the pillows were really nice (and new! I'm a stickler about this). If you're worried about space since it's a tiny house, I found there was plenty of room to stow away suitcases and bags under the ladder. I honestly have no complaints and was extremely impressed! 5 STARS! :)"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first booking through Airbnb. Brad was an excellent host. He and his wife made the process very easy, and both were super accessible for any questions I had during my booking and throughout my stay at the Tiny House with my boyfriend. The Tiny House had everything we could have needed for our 1 night stay. It was in an amazing location, close to lots of sites in downtown Austin (easily no more than 10 minutes away from all the places we were looking to see). We were super satisfied with the great tips Brad provided for places to eat/drink in the area. I would highly recommend the Tiny House to anyone looking to have a ""tiny home"" experience in a great area with some awesome hosts! I would definitely consider booking here again for my next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Brad, Gwen and the Tiny House were all great! We had a great time in Austin and absolutely recommend this air bnb. We used the bikes and rode them all around Austin - definitely a great way to see the city. The location of this house is perfect, close enough to everything but still out of the madness. There are plenty of great restaurants, cafe's and bars within walking distance from this house. The bed was super comfortable. This place is really all you need!"
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! The Tiny house was exactly what I needed on a work trip to Austin. Felt at home, and would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks again."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience at the tiny house! I was here on a little staycation, and it was perfect. I had lattes and tacos and caffe Medici just a few houses down the street, long walks in beautiful downtown, happy hours at Clarks oyster bar. Pure bliss. Brad and his wife were lovely hosts. I felt simultaneously attended to and left alone :) 
I stayed here in January, and was a little worried about it staying warm at night. No problem there. I actually had to crawl down off the loft in the middle of the night to turn down the very effective space heater. 
I will definitely return to the tiny house when it's time for another staycation. "
,,,,,,,,Very enjoyable stay and location.  Brad is very quick to reply to questions and very organized.  Very clean tiny house with everything we needed for an enjoyable overnight experience.  
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were  delightful hosts. Because it was our honeymoon, they even wrote us a welcome note and left us a sweet treat! The tiny house was adorable and comfortable.  We loved the neighborhood - lots of shops and dining within walking distance.  Brad and Gwen had great recommendations for food and entertainment and are excellent hosts! We hope to return and would highly recommend this beautiful tiny home!"
,,,,,,,,Brad and Gwen were fabulous hosts. The tiny house was just as described and more. There was plenty of room for two and the house had everything we could need (even some delicious pour over coffee). Brad and Gwen made an effort to meet us and make us feel welcome in their home. They had excellent suggestions for food and bars as well. Hoping to come back to Austin and visit the tiny house again soon!
,,,,,,,,Definitely tiny!  But a great experience in a SUPER location.  Everything was easy to find and use.  Thanks Brad!
,,,,,,,,Great arrival.  Wonderful directions of the had to knows.  Liked the neighborhood.  Very diverse merchants and restaurants.  Easy to get places on foot.
,,,,,,,,"We stayed in the Tiny House for 4 days. Brad and Gwen were extremely friendly, and reached out to us immediately to make sure we were ok. They gave us recommendations on things to do and where to eat. The tiny house is cozy and well taken care of. Very clean. "
,,,,,,,,"Probably my favorite AirBnB to-date. Brad and Gwen were so accommodating and kind, and the tiny house itself has everything you need to feel comfortable during your stay. It's also easy come-and-go, which is really helpful. Will definitely be staying here on future trips to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I loved this place. It was lovely, quiet, clean--just perfect for a few days. The bikes were really convenient and allowed me to get downtown with ease, and the neighborhood was terrific--a few great little places to eat and shop just a couple of blocks away, and super close to downtown.  The hosts were very helpful and solicitous and got back to me really quickly if I ever needed anything. I would think of an excuse to go to Austin and stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Loved the tiny house! It was comfortable and had everything I needed, and overall it was just fun to hang out in. The location was great; cute neighborhood, easy walk and cheap Uber to the downtown area, and some good places to check out just down the street. Check-in was easy and while I unfortunately didn't get to meet Brad, communicating was easy and quick - both Brad and Gwen were responsive to any questions I had. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,Listing accurate. Good communication. 
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was great! The hosts make everything super easy, the house is adorable and it's located in a great neighborhood! We loved our stay and wished it could have been longer. "
,,,,,,,,Brad and Gwen were amazing and super accommodating! My wife and I were in Austin for our honeymoon and Brad & Gwen even got us a little cake! How sweet is that?! They also gave us TONS of recommendations of things to do/eat/see during our stay. We loved the tiny house and it was the perfect size for just us 2! We would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay with Brad and Gwen, and they gave us some really good recommendations for things to do. The location was great and the place was clean and tidy."
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were great hosts.  The tiny house was the perfect place for me to stay while I was in town for a conference at the convention center.  The tiny house had everything I needed; great attention to details, such as a wine opener and a lantern for the loft bed.  I would definitely recommend the tiny house."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome. Could  walk everywhere.  Brad and Gwen were great hosts. Tiny house was clean, great location, and met our needs perfectly. Would definitely recommend and stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Thoroughly enjoyed my 3 day stay at the tiny house. FANTASTIC location - great neighborhood and about 1.5 miles to my office at 2nd and Congress. Easily walk to Whole Foods on Lamar. Great restaurants and cafes nearby. Super clean (spotless) and very attentive, but not intrusive, hosts.  Thanks for everything!"
,,,,,,,,"Brad and his wife have a great Tiny House and were very helpful with any question I had. Clean, easy, great location!"
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were terrific hosts, and the tiny house was a fun and different experience! The bed was really comfortable, and the tiny house had everything we needed! I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone! "
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was perfect for my trip. It was private, quiet, clean, and had everything I needed to be comfortable. The neighborhood and location were great, just a short walk from good coffee and places to grab a bite. Brad and his family were very welcoming. Would definitely recommend staying in this sweet listing!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience at the tiny house. It was very clean and accommodating in a great location... Quiet neighborhood. Brad and Gwen were awesome hosts. Would stay again.
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I stayed in The Tiny House on our way to Fredericksburg from Houston. It was a great location that made it easy to walk to West 6th Street for a bite to eat and have a few drinks. There are also a few restaurants nearby (within a few blocks) that seemed really nice, but we chose to walk a bit further. The size of the Tiny House was perfect. It was comfortable, VERY clean, well lit, safe location and easy to get to. We will definitely stay here again sometime! "
,,,,,,,,"It was great. Brad contacted me with the code for the door to get into the tiny house and we checked in on time. Brad and his wife reached out to us to make sure things were ok and asked if we needed any suggestions for what to do in Austin. The place was clean and well managed. The bed was comfy and the bathroom surprisingly roomy for a tiny house. We were warm in the lofted bed the first night but figured out that putting the fan below and blowing cold air up to the loft was the solution and on the second night it was cooler up top then below. We would definitely stay in the tiny house again. They let us use the outside porch which was illuminated with lights and had a table and chairs later at night. It was perfect once the hot weather cooled off for the day. 

"
,,,,,,,,"Really fun getting to try a tiny house, and we enjoyed the nearby restaurants and shops. (Which were easy to find thanks to all the info provided by the great hosts!)"
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was perfect for our short visit to Austin! Brad and Gwen made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. They were great to communicate with before, during, and after our stay. Plenty of great bars, restaurants, and coffee shops nearby. We couldn't have asked for a better location, accommodations, or hosts!"
,,,,,,,,Was clean. The little house was super cute. Bikes were a great touch and Brad was really nice. I would recommend staying here. Visited on my honeymoon and had a great time. Wish we stayed longer! 
,,,,,,,,My wife and I had a great time staying in the tiny house with bikes. All our tiny needs were met. We really enjoyed the quietness of the neighborhood coupled with the close proximity to downtown and the south congress area.
,,,,,,,,"Great experience, place to stay, and location! I would stay here again. Brad and Gwen made it very easy and convenient. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was adorable, well furbished, clean & comfortable. I got routine texts checking that I had everything I needed and felt so welcome. Great location! Thanks so much, will be back!"
,,,,,,,,"If you're wanting a great Austin experience, this is the place. Awesome. Our hosts were very kind, and they gave a thorough and excellent set of recommendations for the neighborhood and Austin in general. The tiny house was spotless, checkin was a snap even though we had a late flight, and I gotta say, it's one of the best places I've stayed, ever. Three minute walk TOPS to some great restaurants, groceries, coffee and even a DANIEL JOHNSTON mural! The location has that neighborhood vibe, and still you're so close to all the great things the city has to offer.

The tiny house itself was a great experience. The place is small, but it's not all that different from a hotel space-wise. The difference, and what makes the tiny house great, is the vibe. The place is so comfy and welcoming, and it's easy to settle in right when you arrive. Plus, you're welcomed there by some nice folks. When you come back for the night, it's to a quiet neighborhood and a front door, which is a great feeling.

I wholeheartedly recommend the tiny house. As an AirBNB user and to friends. Seriously, I recommended it to a friend who's visiting Austin later this year. "
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen's 'Tiny House' was a great spot for a couple of days checking out Austin. It really is small, but perfectly proportioned to ensure you don't feel cramped. The neighbourhood is very beautiful with some wonderful nearby restaurants across all price bands -- I paid repeat visits to 24 Diner which is a 10-15 minute walk away and EXCELLENT. Brad and Gwen themselves are model hosts, very welcoming, generous with information and extremely responsive. A tiny issue with hot water (which turned out to be me being dumb!) was answered immediately and with wonderful cranberry scones."
,,,,,,,,"I am from Austin and was just looking for a Tiny House adventure. Brad and Gwen's Tiny House was an amazing experience!  First of all, the location was perfect and easy walk or bike to some of the hottest spots in Austin.  Brad was there to welcome me in the house and later I met Gwen on the porch, both of them are super cool.  The house itself is everything you come to expect from a Tiny House; everything you need, nothing you don't.  Their's was exceptionally clean, well stocked, and extremely comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again.  Thanks y'all!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location (very walkable...even to downtown), hosts very easy to talk to/communicate with. Place is cute and incredibly clean. Well stocked with towels. "
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I stayed here on our recent trip to Austin and it was amazing! Brad and Gwen were lovely, and the space was extremely clean and welcoming. Plus the location is perfect for those interested in exploring Lake Ladybird and downtown. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were excellent hosts and were very attentive to us during our stay at Tiny House with Bikes! 

The house itself was very clean and had a very functional layout.  Also, it was within walking distance to several places we wanted to go to in Austin.

Street parking was easily accessible and surrounding neighborhood was walkable and well kept.

We will stay there again whenever we come back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Austin...Wow. So much to see, so much to do. The Tiny House--perfect for a couple of nights for two who want to see and experience the various things Austin has to offer; The Tiny House is clean, fresh, stylish. Brad and Gwen - breaths of fresh air, all-around good people, friendly, helpful, accommodating. Neighborhood- family friendly, safe, bike-friendly, walkable. Walking or biking distance to Lady Bird Trail Loop, restaurants and shops. Wooden privacy fence surrounds main house and The Tiny House which contributed to our feeling of security. Such a soul-inspiring getaway for me and my daughter. Brad and Gwen, Thanks from the bottom of hearts.

Jeanne and Julie"
,,,,,,,,"Brad & Gwen were the sweetest hosts, they had a list of place to eat and check out walking/biking distance. The bikes they offer are a great deal and we had an awesome time checking out the city on them. They made us feel at home, and checked up with us to see if we had everything we need. The Tiny house is in a central location, a uber ride to downtown was around $5, and to South Congress $13. This place is a great value and will definitely stay there again when we go back. "
,,,,,,,,"Brad and his wife were amazingly hospitable. They were incredibly helpful and had a descriptive list of suggestions with things to do and see in Austin for everyone. We used this as our guide an followed it everyday. 
The tiny house is beautiful and immaculately clean. 
Brad and Gwen were very considerate and communicative and were an absolute joy to stay with as they go above and beyond. I highly recommend staying at their gorgeous tiny house. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great!  Check in was very convenient.  The house was a short walk to downtown.  We walked it a few times to 6th street.  Other times, we took an uber which was only about 5-6 dollars.  The place was very clean, and the bed was really comfortable.  Brad  was great host, and he checked in with us to make sure everything was going ok.  I would definitely book again!"
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was absolutely lovely, and the neighborhood of Clarksville was a gem. I walked to beautiful restaurants nearby and heard great music right there. Brad and his wife were so nice and helpful. I loved my stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were awesome. The tiny house was legit! Exactly the experience we were looking for. The bikes were a the perfect touch because we got to explore the neighborhood... and its a good one! Tons of great restaurants in the area the 2 of them recommended. Oh and we even had room to do an Insanity workout on their porch!! Great, cozy place for 2! "
,,,,,,,,"The Tiny house is exactly that, tiny - about the size of a dorm room! My friend and I were at a conference most of the day so we weren't hanging out. It is tight quarters for 2 friends but it works. It's clean, cool and comfortable. The neighborhood is good. We felt safe and there are plenty of stores and restaurants close by. We had a car and were able to park next to the house each day we were there. The only real bummer was that there is no freezer in the mini-fridge (I brought an ice pack for bagged (URL HIDDEN) I wasn't able to make that work) and you cannot use the stove (only the microwave). It didn't register with me that kitchenette with microwave meant microwave only - I should have asked. All and all it's a really cute place that is safe, cool, and clean. The hosts Brad and Gwen are super nice and accommodating."
,,,,,,,,"Brad and his wife were extremely welcoming and offered a ton of excellent advice.  We enjoyed the location and the tiny house, both were very quiet which was nice to get away to sleep from the busy Austin nightlife.  They are close enough to make it to the action either by bikes or a cheap uber! The tiny was extremely clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,The tiny house was perfect for me and my stay in Austin! The location was excellent and great for exploring. The house is right down the street from the galaxy cafe which was on their list of recommendations and was great for breakfasts! I didn't get a chance to meet brad because of scheduling but I did meet his wife and she was very nice and accommodating. I would definitely considering staying here again my next time in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay in the Clarksville Tiny House!  Brad and Gwen were both very welcoming, checking to see if we had everything we needed and leaving a helpful guide to the area.  The tiny house was impeccably clean and very cute inside, with room to lounge and arrange for our things.  It is conveniently located in beautiful Clarksville, near a number of our favorite Austin restaurants and within walking distance of Lamar, 6th, pease park, and town lake.  there isn't much better than an evening walk around Clarksville, either!  "
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were excellent hosts! The Tiny House is truly tiny, but it's perfect for staying a few nights, checking out the city. A perfect location for walking, biking, or driving downtown, and in a gorgeous neighborhood with a fantastic local coffee shop a few blocks away. Brad and Gwen were a text message away and checked in to make sure I was enjoying my stay, not only in the Tiny House but in their city as well. They left a list with some great tips for dining out, a map of the city, and places to check out. I will definitely stay with them again on future visits!"
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen were awesome hosts, and the Tiny House was exactly what we expected. We were lucky enough to have a conversation with Brad and Gwen while we were all in the backyard. They were very friendly and had perfect tips about cool stuff to do in Austin. They even have a three page guide in the Tiny House listing fun stuff to do and see. 

The Tiny House was clean, modern, exactly like the pictures. The bed was comfortable, the AC worked well, and there was even cable TV. We felt like we were in a cool, secluded hotel. The bikes worked perfectly, as well. The house was a short bike ride to every cool spot in Austin.

This was our first stay in Austin, and we will definitely be back to stay in the Tiny House again."
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was clean, comfortable, cozy and convenient. It was in a nice quiet location with easy access to downtown. Brad and his wife were friendly and welcoming and offered good suggestions and solid Austin advice. I would stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,Tiny House was great.  The hosts were helpful and quick to respond w answers to questions etc.  Would totally stay at TH again.
,,,,,,,,This place was a perfect house to stay at for SXSW. I would highly recommend it to people for their stay in Austin. I will be back next year!
,,,,,,,,"Tiny House with Bikes was exactly as advertised! Lovely set up and location, Brad & Gwen were very welcoming and had a whole list of recommendations for the area which was great. I was able to bike and car2go to the conference center with ease â€“ and walked the slightly longer walk back a couple of times too. All-in-all a wonderful home base for my introduction to Austin, would definitely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,Staying in the tiny house was such an amazing experience and we were only a couple blocks away from everything. It was very clean and provided everything we needed for our stay. Brad and Gwen were terrific hosts and exceeded our expectations. Austin is a wonderful city and it's full of friendly people. If you are going to Austin you MUST check out the tiny house. 
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house  was the perfect place for a weekend in Austin. The neighborhood is really cute and quiet, the house was clean and exactly what we expected. Brad was an excellent host and really easy to communicate with. Highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"I was in town for business and was looking for a place close to downtown. 
The apartment was perfect for a business stay, with excellent accessibility to the city, and the ability to rent a bicycle made it easy to experience the city of Austin.Â Â Great location, great stay. 
"
,,,,,,,,"This is a very comfortable space in a great neighborhood just outside of downtown Austin.  Everything I needed to completely relax when I was not at my convention.  There are a few great shops and restaurants within close walking distance.  The neighborhood was very quiet while I was there and it seemed to be a perfect little place to have a tiny house.  
While my schedule didn't allow me to connect with the hosts, all of their communication was great, friendly, and they made sure I had what I needed to enjoy my stay!
I would definitely stay again should my business bring me back to Austin.
Private Note for any tallettes out there: I'm 6'10"" tall and was comfortable here - the maximum standing height in the entrance and bathroom is about 6'8"" or so.  Prepare to duck/slouch accordingly - plenty of room in the open area and bed :)"
,,,,,,,,"Such a great stay in the tiny house. It's VERY tiny but had everything we needed. The location is amazing -- If you like walking, downtown is totally accessible by foot. Otherwise, the bus is a 5 minute walk away and cab rides are about $6 from downtown. The bikes were also a huge plus -- they're old and a bit worn but if you're just using them to cruise around, they're fine. Brad was a lovely host -- there when we needed him and more than accommodating.  We highly recommend a stay in the tiny house -- cozy, romantic and comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"We had a lovely time at the tiny house! Brad provided everything we needed, including an awesome list of tips for things to do around the neighbourhood! The area they are in is beautiful, and we found it totally reasonable to walk to downtown from the house. We loved the fact that the door opened by a code,  so we didn't need to worry about how to get keys. The tiny house was perfect for us :)"
,,,,,,,,"It was really lovely staying in the house. I spent the 2nd part of my stay down town, and I was happy to have had a stay on the west side of town because it gave me a chance to see more of Austin than I would have. Having the use of the bicycle was great - again, I was able to see more of the city and to do more. Couldn't have been happier. Bed super comfy too :D"
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was Perfect!! I stayed with my mom for her birthday vacation in Austin. I slept in the loft and my mom said she was comfortable and slept great on the pull out couch. The loft bed is very comfortable. The house is very clean and set up thoughtfully so it has everything you need! We had plenty of fresh towels. Having the mini fridge and small microwave was convenient. We walked everywhere and felt very safe and had phenomenal food, coffee, salon, and drink places in close walking distance. We had a car and never had a problem finding parking in the street right next to the house. Brad and Gwen are wonderful hosts and extremely nice and helpful. We probably could have talked to them all day about Austin and places to go and see. I will definitely stay here again for future trips to Austin and I can't say enough good things about our stay in the tiny house!"
,,,,,,,,We LOVED experiencing the tiny house! It's the perfect place to come home to after a day around Austin! Plus the code on the door makes it a breeze to come and go without worrying about keys. It was super nice that it was within walking distance to a great coffeeshop and free parking on the street. The tiny house lets you feel like you have a house in Austin for a bit:)
,,,,,,,,"Brad and Gwen are fantastic hosts. The place was clean with fresh towels, sheets. Location is awesome, close to the hustle and bustle but in a quiet and quaint neighborhood.  Hope to call Tiny House home when we visit again! "
,,,,,,,,"Stayed in the house for almost a full week while travelling for work.  Bard and Gwen were very hospitable and made sure I felt comfortable reaching out to them for suggestions. The space was very clean and comfortable, and very central to other neighborhoods."
,,,,,,,,"The Tiny House is in a great location for a trip to Austin. Clarksville is a very sweet neighborhood, and within walking distance or a short cab/Uber ride to most major sites in town. Brad and Gwen were excellent hosts - very welcoming, always available to answer questions and accommodating. The bed in Tiny House is very comfortable and overall the place suited our needs. "
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I had a fabulous experience with the tinyhouse on our first trip to Austin!

Location: perfect! I was happy to learn Clarksville is a quaint neighborhood within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and bars.  I liked our ability to come back to a quiet area without giving up that close proximity to downtown. Also, we never had a problem parking our rental car which was wonderful considering parking downtown can be a pain

The tinyhouse:  
everything we needed!  The space is fresh bright and cosy. We were a bit nervous to stay in a tinyhouse having only used hotels but when we arrived we couldn't have asked for more. The bed was so comfortable and if you don't feel like going up and down the latter the couch easily pulls out into beds.  The bathroom was full size ( I was worried it would feel like camping, but it was big enough with a great shower). 

Hospitality:
Couldn't ask for better hosts!  Brad was always available to answer any questions and made our first airbnb experience super easy. The house had great touches like organic soaps, Austin magazines, and pretty outside lights to turn on while sitting and relaxing on the patio.  The bike rental was a major bonus. It seems as if everyone in Austin bikes and we didn't have to find a place to rent them...very easy.   All in all a wonderful value and wonderful experience. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a really great two night stay at the tiny house. It was in a great location with a lovely yard and we couldn't have been happier with having rented the bikes. This was our first trip to Austin and the bikes enabled us to sail around the city, meandering all over and seeing a lot of what Austin has to offer. As for the tiny house itself, it offered such an easy way to check in! After entering the lovely fenced yard, we punched in a code and were right in. The tiny house was so clean we had to remind ourselves that there were many airbnb reviewers before us, so we weren't the first to stay. Very comfortable bed, nice little kitchen with coffee, tea, a mini fridge and microwave. The ""couch"" is actually two twin beds, which is great if you're not into loft sleeping and the flat screen tv was a five star touch. The bathroom was spacious and adorable for such a small dwelling and the beautiful natural light coming in from one of the many windows. We didn't make use of the yard, but it was so cute. Gwen and Brad were very sweet and super attentive. We are so happy that we found this awesome spot to stay! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a good time in Austin. The tiny house is super fun, very clean and the location is amazing. We had a chance to meet Brad and Gwen and they are so nice; besides that they gave us lots of privacy. The tiny house is for reals tiny (built on top of a trailer) but so cozy. I have already recommended it to friends."
,,,,,,,,"Check-in was easy since Bradley provided an access code, so I didn't need to coordinate my arrival with anyone. I met him and his wife Gwen - both were very friendly and checked to make sure everything was okay. The neighborhood is great. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the house - I've been curious about Tiny Houses  for a while and was very glad to have a chance to try one out.   The place was very clean with reliable hot water. For a two-night stay it was great. The ladder to the loft looked intimidating at first, but once I tried it, I had no problems. "
,,,,,,,,"Very cute little place. Good location, would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Our stay in the tiny house was great!  We were new to Airbnb and to Austin and I am now a big fan of both.  Brad and Gwen are wonderful hosts with great recommendations that fit your person travel needs. They are very easy to communicate with and responsive to any needs you may have.  The tiny house is perfect for an authentic Austin experience. It's located in a great neighborhood that is close to many great restaurants and really close to everything.  We used the bikes that you can rent with the tiny house and were able to bike and see most of Austin!  We had a great time:)  
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful stay. The tiny house is adorable, clean and tidy with fluffy towels and heating/aircon so would be comfortable regardless of weather. Cute little neighbourhood and they even leave a helpful locals guide to the area and Austin. super helpful and responsive. Definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"What can I say about the Tiny House? It was perfect for my boyfriend and I! A really neat place to stay with a perfect location. Also it is super clean, everything looks brand new and it's got every comfort we could ask for including temperature control, tv, clean towels, fridge and a microwave. Also, our wonderful hosts provided us with a plethora of recommendations left for us on the counter in 3 typed, easy to read pages. We did not have the pleasure of meeting Brad but we luckily had the chance to meet Gwen briefly who was a pleasure and didn't hesitate to remind us that they would be readily available in case we needed anything. Austin is an amazing city. Make sure to check out Rainey street! And we would definitely stay in the Tiny House again next time we find ourselves in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first time in Austin, first time using Airbnb and first time living in a tiny house--and it rocked! We couldn't have asked for a better time. I was blown away by how friendly and caring everyone in Austin was (including Brad and his wife Gwen). The house was so sweet, totally modern and updated and the neighborhood was close to 6th street, where we spent most of our time. Brad also gave us awesome recommendations for music and food, and not one of them let us down! I would highly recommend renting the bikes during your stay. It was a fun way to explore a new city! Also loved that the house had a code to enter (saved us a lot of time searching for a key every time we left the home). "
,,,,,,,,"The house is tiny, but very clean and well equipped. Brad made us feel welcome and was available for any issues. The neighborhood is great and has some nice coffee shops and restaurants, plus a grocery store up the street. Overall a good Air BnB listing!"
,,,,,,,,"Accommodation: The tiny house is exactly that - tiny. But perfect for a couple of nights. Wouldn't recommend for any more than 2 people. The ladder to the loft bed made for a bit of fun. 
Location: It's just a stones throw from 6th St (quiet end), and walkable to downtown. The bike taxis may be reluctant to ride you home (even from the main part of 6th) as it's a bit far for their glutes to handle, but you can generally convince them. Otherwise it's a $10-$20 uber to/from pretty much everywhere. 
The host: One of the best air bnb experiences we've had - mostly due to Brad being such a great host. Despite us staying right behind the main house, it was super private. And although we never actually saw Brad, he was only an email or call away and checked in regularly to see how we were doing. "
,,,,,,,,"The Tiny House in Austin, TX is an amazing place to stay when visiting this beautiful city! 

The home is about 1 mile from the main city area and very very easy to get to and from - most of the trip we used the bikes which you can rent from Brad for $10 each for your whole stay, city busses, walked, or used Uber ($8 average fare). So re: location it's great!

Then the house itself is very cute and cozy. It's definitely a Tiny House but I never felt cramped or uncomfortable - if anything I felt right at home. Most days we would explore the city all morning and early afternoon, and then come back to the Tiny House for wine and snacks in the late afternoon and it was nice to watch TV in the living area or sit on the back porch which is beautifully shaded by an old oak tree and I love the decor - the little strung lights, big red chairs, and iron table to sit and eat or work at. 

Even though it's a ""Tiny House"" the bathroom is quite spacious (especially the shower!) and the bed is queen size and extremely comfortable. 

Overall my husband and I felt very comfortable at the Tiny House and plan on returning the next time we're in Austin! 

Oh, and most of all - Brad and Gwen are incredible hosts. They are attentive, helpful and super friendly! Gwen often text me ideas of places to check out and even sketches of walking directions (for a tricky place to get to). They are wonderful hosts and make the entire stay even more welcoming and enjoyable. 

I highly recommend that you stay in the Tiny House the next time you're in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"I just returned from a business conference in Austin and I thoroughly enjoyed my accommodations which were much more interesting than those of my colleagues!

Brad and Gwen were wonderful hosts who made me feel at home. I was busy most of the time and didn't spend much time in the tiny house, but when I did everything was in order and as advertised. It was especially convenient to be able to communicate with Brad via text message when needed.

The house is a nice walk from the Convention Center. I walked each morning and took a $7-8 cab back at night.

I had a little difficulty with water temperature on my first night. It was probably my fault. Gwen took a look that day to make sure there were no further issues and they were kind enough to leave me a few local beers in the fridge for the inconvenience.

The tiny house is great. The ladder, which is completely manageable, is not for the unadventurous, especially getting down it. It would have been nice to have a light switch and a power outlet where the bed is lofted so that I could charge my phone nearby and turn off the light from bed.

I would definitely recommend staying in this tiny house if you were interested in a unique experience with all the comforts of a small apartment. "
,,,,,,,,"The Tiny House was cozy, comfy, and very clean! Brad and his family were wonderful hosts, and the location of the Tiny House couldn't have been better - it's in an adorable neighborhood, walkable to many great restaurants + markets.  I only wish I could've stayed longer."
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house in Clarksville was great! Bradley and his wife were both very nice and left great suggestions for things to do in Clarksville and Austin. We had a great time staying in the tiny house and felt very comfortable in the loft and on the pull out twin beds. The neighborhood was great - we walked to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and an adorable old soda fountain. 

Thanks Bradley! "
,,,,,,,,"Brad & Gwen were exceptional hosts. Be sure to ask them about the cool places to visit in Austin! We had a blast! The tiny house is located in a very cool neighborhood which is close by to pretty much everything downtown. And it's cosy, too. Great place! "
,,,,,,,,Bradley's tiny house was ideal. Great neighborhood. This great use of space was clean and sensible. I could not have been more pleased! 
,,,,,,,,"We had a lovely time in this tiny house!  Our hosts were super helpful with the ins and outs of Austin.  Plus the location was superb.  Clarksville, itself, has a ton going on.  Not to mention, we were able to walk to Kayaking on the river, Zilker Park and Downtown.  I wholeheartedly recommend this place and hope to be able to return sometime soon!"
,,,,,,,,"I came to Austin for a wedding and flew in pretty late and only arrived around 1 am, the passcode type of lock on the door is wonderful since they don't actually have to be there to meet you to check in or out.

Bradley and his wife Gwen were really helpful and tried to make my stay as easy and enjoyable as possible.  They were always available by phone/text to answer questions or inquiries.

The tiny house is tiny but really comfy. The shower temperature is a bit hard to control to get just right, and the bed in the loft took some getting use to since there is no railing and pretty high up.  I didn't spend much time hanging out there other than to sleep but I found it really nice and quiet. Since it's a separate building, you get a lot of privacy rather than sharing a room in someone else's place.

Also if you don't mind walking, you can get to a lot of bars/restaurants in 15-20 mins to downtown. I walked a lot at night when it was cool out, but took Uber for the day time in the heat."
,,,,,,,,My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights after we got married. Brad and Gwen were amazing hosts and we will definitely be back next time we're in Austin together!
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying here. The tiny house is cool and the location is nice. Walking distance to some good coffee shops and restaurants. Just about a $10 cab ride to some of the coolest music and bars. Hosts were great, accommodating and gave some good advice on places to go in Austin. You won't regret staying in the Tiny House!"
,,,,,,,,"Brad is an excellent host, and this is a fantastic, walkable neighborhood.  Brad went out of his way to give us great advice, and as a result we had a spectacular visit to Austin.  And the bikes make it all the more fun and convenient.  It is easy to bike to downtown or Zilker park, just minutes, and quite easy.  

The house is small, no question about that, but it's as big or bigger than hotel rooms that cost 3x as much and don't come with a great guide and bikes!

Brad's family, who live in the house in front of the tiny house and share the deck, was very friendly, but they were careful to give us all the space we wanted.

Every morning we walked to La Medici coffee shop, which has excellent breakfast tacos and good espresso in a friendly atmosphere.  We walked to dinner at Josephine's House, which was excellent.  Both of those are within 5 minutes on foot.  I even walked back to the house from the Austin Convention Center, which was a nice long 40-minute walk, certainly doable.  When we didn't feel like walking, an Uber driver picked us up within 3-4 minutes.  In short, you really can't beat this location, especially at this price.

When we were there, it was really too hot to sleep in the loft area; the AC unit just wasn't powerful enough to reach up there.  We told Brad about that, and I believe he has plans to address that situation.  Probably just a fan would do the trick.  The two fold-out beds in the living area were easy to operate and more than adequate, and the AC cooled that area just fine."
,,,,,,,,"Great hosts, great little house, in a great neighborhood in Austin. Did I mention everything was great? Because it was."
,,,,,,,,Brad did a great job of communicating before and during our stay. The house is exactly as advertised and in a great location in Austin. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"The Tiny House was fantastic! My husband and I enjoyed our time there! We used the bikes to ride around down town -- this was a great feature! The Tiny House had everything we needed for our 2 nights in Austin! Bradley & his wife are very kind & welcoming! They proved great resources for restaurants and things to do around town! We were able to walk down town from the Tiny House location or ride our bikes. We liked to walk down town in the late afternoon and enjoy our evening out then take an Uber ride back to the house. And Uber ride from down town is around $7. We loved our experience at the Tiny House & totally recommend it! 5 Stars! Our favorite things in Austin: kayaking on the lake, watching the bats from under the bridge, Franklin BBQ and the Kung Fu Saloon (free arcade)! Thanks!!"
,,,,,,,,This was a great apt. I loved the coffee they provided. The instructions they provided for the apt were fantastic. 
,,,,,,,,"We can only reiterate all the positive things other reviewers have said. My husband and I saw the movie Tiny and wanted to try out a small house while in Austin. Staying in the Tiny House was definitely a worthwhile new experience. As this was our first airbnb, we didnâ€™t have anything to compare to, but we were totally blown away. Everything was very clean, obviously well thought out and taken care of with everything you could need for comfortable accommodations. The ac was perfect during the hot Texas summer, and the location was just right especially for using the bikes. Itâ€™s close to downtown without being right in the hustle and bustle and in a nice neighborhood nearby hip little eateries. Brad was an excellent host who was friendly, eager to help with anything if needed, and checked in with us to make sure we were doing ok. What a fantastic stay! We would definitely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our Stay at the Tiny House! The bikes made it even better, we rode all around Austin, a city great exploring on bike. Brad was very helpful throughout our stay. Would stay again, and we loved Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Bradley was great and very welcoming.
,,,,,,,,"The tiny house was perfect for me. Clean, simple, quiet. Love the neighborhood. I've been wanting to check out Tiny Houses, and this was a perfect opportunity with sweet hosts! Brad and his wife could not have been more accommodating or helpful, and checked in with me throughout the stay. Our schedules seemed to go in different directions, but I'm so glad we finally crossed paths one night. We had a nice chat and I wish we could have hung out more! Consummate hosts- they'll provide you with tips on whatever you want to do or see. I'd go back in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,Bradley was a responsive and thoughtful host.   The Tiny House is perfectly located in a very walkable neighborhood with lots of restaurant options.   I couldn't have enjoyed the Tiny House more.   It was simple but perfect with thoughtful touches.   Excellent experience.
,,,,,,,,"What a great place.  We really enjoyed our stay.  
The location is terrific, street parking right outside, and on extremely quiet street - even though it is quite a hip part of Austin.  The house is really cute and just enough room for 2.  It is extremely clean with lots of sheets and towels and the air conditioner was running when we arrived.  
Bradley was very responsive and helpful.  Definitely recommend."
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at the Tiny House. Brad was very helpful and genuinely concerned about our trip.  Everything was clean and he had even had the a/c on and the house was the perfect temperature.   They provided a huge list of helpful info on restaurants,  sights, and things to do in Austin.  We couldn't have been happier with our time in the Tiny House and will be contacting Brad next time we visit Austin."
,,,,,,,,"What an incredible first airbnb experience. Bradley was a wonderful host. The tiny home was perfect for my girlfriend and I to spend a great 4th of July weekend in Austin. The shower takes some getting used to, but the A/C is cold and the bed is comfortable. 

When we arrived, Bradley gave us a (very) quick tour of the house, and had printed material explaining everything about the tiny house, along with a whole page of activities to do in Austin. He was always available via phone if we had any questions or needed anything. Overall, a great experience and a fantastic place to stay. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Tiny house was excellent. Everything you need, nothing you don't!  Hosts were very cool and relaxed. The neighborhood is great- quiet and close to downtown.  The amenity in the house was also impressive. In that neighborhood, you can't beat tiny house!!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay in the Tiny House.

It's a quirky, fun place to stay in a good location and a very safe part of town.

The house itself is compact (it's all in the name ;) ) but has everything you need and it was spotlessly clean.

Brad was a great host, very responsive and a nice person to deal with. We had a minor issue with some plumbing and he went above and beyond to resolve it quickly.

Stay here, you won't regret it."
,,,,,,,,"Quite cute little building with everything you need. Brad and Gwen were very nice, waited for us when we showed up late and had drinks with us on the porch discussing UT Austin and the city culture. They prepared a set of instructions on everything from the A/C to shower, along with a list of stuff to do in the city including restaurants and museums. Nice folks eager to play host. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Brad was a great host, and we enjoyed staying in the Tiny House! It's tiny as advertised but well equipped with everything we needed and was the perfect amount of space for two. Also, it's a great location--nice neighborhood close to Downtown."
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at the Tiny House! It was comfortable, clean, and super private. The location can't be beat. Brad and Gwen were excellent hosts and were always there if we needed anything. We will definitely come back on our next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,The tiny house was a perfect accommodation for our weekend getaway. It felt brand new; everything was spotless and comfortable. Brad was extremely welcoming and always made a point to be available. His list of nearby spots was a great introduction to Clarksville. We'll be sure to seek him out on our next trip to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were curious about tiny houses and were really excited to try one out. We had a great experience! It was surprisingly roomy, really clean and well kept, and the hosts were responsive. Excellent location, too. "
,,,,,,,,"This airbnb was a perfect home base for my stay in Austin. It's in a charming and safe neighborhood with good restaurants, coffeehouse and groceries within walking distance. The house itself is tiny as described but it is super clean (seems brand new), on a really nice property and is organized in a way where you have everything you need and have privacy. It's ideal for single travelers or couples. Brad is a great host...he's quick to respond to any questions I had via text and was super friendly. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Bradley and his wife were welcoming and the tiny house was comfy and clean. We loved the quite, neighborhood with beautiful older homes. It was also very close to downtown which was super convenient. We were very happy with our stay and would highly recommend it to others looking for a place to stay in Austin.

"
,,,,,,,,"Staying in the Tiny House was a great experience. It is walking distance from great coffee shops, bars and restaurants, and Brad and Gwen were extremely helpful, accommodating hosts. I would highly-recommend renting from them if you are visiting Austin."
15219960,,8,10,10,10,10,10,He was such a help from the get go. Help our stay be more pleasant. I honestly didn't have any problems whatsoever. The place was wonderful. Every time I had a question he answered as soon as he could. Definitely will rent his place when I go back to Austin in the future. He even let us stay hours later after our checkout. Big ups to Nate. Thank you
8540409,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,"Great location.  Good for a couple.  Close to 6th St., but you can walk anywhere downtown, to Lake Austin, even S. Congress.  "
,,,,,,,,"Kenny's home is in the PERFECT location if you want to have the full Austin experience! It's in the center of downtown, allowing easy walkability to many 6th street and other downtown bars and restaurants. It's also really close to other great spots: UT campus, Zilker park, South Congress, Barton Springs, etc. The home is very spacious and comfortable, and it has lots of amenities (coffee, toiletry items, cookware, iron, TV) to make your stay enjoyable. Kenny was very friendly and easy to book/communicate with. We cannot recommend this place highly enough!"
,,,,,,,,"Comfy place. Perfect location, great town! "
,,,,,,,,Kenny was great and super responsive to texting if you had any questions or concerns. It was a great location to be in. 
,,,,,,,,"The place was great, lots of room and in the heart of the town!  Definitely recommended "

,,,,,,,,"Exactly like the pictures.

Bed was really comfortable.

Couldn't be in a better location either."
,,,,,,,,"Kenny did all that he could possibly do to make my stay easy and convenient. The place is as described and, if anything, understated how centrally located it is with easy access to downtown Austin.

As a side note, if you happen to be coming to town for a conference, I can't think of a better place to stay, just a block and a half from the convention center. Will recommend his place early and often."
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment downtown, everything is as described! Kenny was very responsive to all of our questions."
,,,,,,,,Great location right downtown. Can walk or bike everywhere. Loved the Austin decor and the parking space is great if you have a car/rental. Kenny was easy to reach and responded quickly. Would book again!
,,,,,,,,Thank you for the clear instructions. Convenient for walking around the city. 
,,,,,,,,Can't beat the location. Made getting around to everything we wanted to do very easy! Kenny was a great host and was very quick to respond to all questions.
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at Kenny's apartment! The location is phenomenal and the apartment itself is fantastic. Thoroughly impressed with everything and we hope to return to Austin/this apartment again soon!!
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was a very nice host and the location was in a great part of town where you could walk to everything or take a very short cab.

The bed was very comfortable and I was very happy about that.

The apartment was clean and well represented.  Kenny was nice enough to let us arrive a few hours earlier than we were allowed too.  So thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Kenny was really great - responsive and helpful. I thought the location was fantastic - super accessible to the bus from the Airport and minutes to the events I needed to attend at the convention center. Thanks so much for your hospitality!
,,,,,,,,"We came for the last day of ACL and Kenny's place was perfect for it. We were just a couple blocks from the shuttle to ACL which made it very convenient. The place was ready before check in and he was very accommodating since we had to park our car before heading to the festival. Will recommend to anyone looking for a good time in Austin, TX!!"
,,,,,,,,Great spot to stay at. Clean and decorated with cool Austin things. Close enough to walk to just about anywhere and around the corner from 6th street!
,,,,,,,,This was a wonderful place to stay right in downtown Austin. The bed was so comfy and we had a great time!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, easy walk to all that Austin has to offer"
,,,,,,,,"Kenny's place is great! Awesome location, clean and comfortable, I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a place to stay in Austin. As a first time Airbnb user I felt some trepidation but this was an extremely positive experience! Kenny was quick to respond to all of my questions as well as an accommodating and gracious host. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in a great location and very close to 6th street and Congress. Kenny was also quick to respond to any questions I had. We stayed the weekend here and had a great time, although at night the outside noise from neighbors and the street came in quite loudly even with the windows shut. "
,,,,,,,,"You can't beat the location or value of this place! Everything you could need is there, and Kenny was extremely responsive in answering questions. I highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at here for a girls weekend in Austin (4 of us). The apartment was cute, clean, comfortable and had all the basic necessities we needed. Really also appreciated the parking spot. It was incredibly easy to walk to downtown and night life from there. Kenny was so responsive via messaging and made the whole experience effortless. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was a great host and the location of the apartment is excellent. 
Great air con too. "
,,,,,,,,"The accomodation was a fantastic place, great location, very clean and comfortable. Kenny was easy to contact and the key arrangements were so simple and efficient. Perfect stay! "
,,,,,,,,Perfect rental. Unit as described.  Great location.   Excellent communication.  10/10 would stay again and recommend.  Kenny is the ideal host.   
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was very responsive with emails. The location was just a couple blocks from 6th street and the Driskell hotel (bakery,cafe, bar). Only 10 "" walk to Rainey street. There was plenty of pillows, blankets, and has a nice kitchen with a toaster oven, small coffee machine, microwave stove and enough cooking utensils. The apartment is close to the entrance, the parking stall is also close, but note apartment is on 2nd floor. Great air conditioning. "
,,,,,,,,"Kennys Downtown Western Suite suited our needs perfectly! It was a great location, you could walk to all parts of town. Also the bed was extremely comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,Kenny was so accommodating! This was the first Airbnb I've ever stayed in and he made the experience a great one! Located centrally and a quick walk to anything you need. Would highly recommend staying here when you visit Austin.
,,,,,,,,Kenny's place was wonderful! The location was perfect and since it was pouring during my stay the covered garage parking was a necessity. 
,,,,,,,,"Kenny's studio was very well located and very nice ! Kenny was very easy to join and he answered very quickly to all our questions.
Thanks Kenny
"
,,,,,,,,Kenny was really responsive with all of the questions that I had. After having heard horror stories of hosts canceling last minute in a hopes to raise prices we were so happy to see Kenny's status as a super host. This location is perfect for 4th and 6th Street night life as well as getting to the convention center easily.
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was great and super responsive. Our trip got us in really late and and leaving late and Kenny allowed us to stay for a little bit longer than the original check out time. Also when the toilet broke Kenny was very responsive and quick to fix it. 

Additionally the beds were extremely comfortable! "
,,,,,,,,Great stay in a great location! Host was very helpful.
,,,,,,,,The place was perfect! Great location and very comfortable for us 3 girls. The unit was clean and the building was safe and well-maintained. Kenny was very accommodating and even let us check in early. I would definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,Great location. Everything was about a 5 min walking distance or 10 min drive. Place was clean and had an awesome smart TV. We would watch movies for hours when it was raining. We highly enjoyed our stay here
,,,,,,,,Location was great. The place was clean and easy to find. Kenny was nice and timely with his responses to any questions that I had. 
,,,,,,,,Comfortable and clean condo in a prime Austin location. Included parking was a big plus. Check in was super easy. 
,,,,,,,,Perfect location to walk to everything that Austin has to offer (we parked the car and didn't have to touch it until we left)! Clean apartment with everything we needed! Kenny was easy to contact and answered all questions promptly. Highly recommended!! 
,,,,,,,,I texted Kenny several times and he responded promptly. Loved the location and proximity to 6th street without the noise of 6th street. The bed was super comfortable and would love to rent it again next time.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was so wonderful and easy thanks to Kenny and his apartment. He gave the most straight forward instructions about how to get the key for the place, and the parking space, etc. I didn't have many questions for him- only about a local grocery store and the Wifi, but when I did ask him via text- he immediately responded and in such a friendly manner. The apartment was clean and stocked with all basic necessities. The location couldn't possibly be more perfect. In the middle of town, but far enough away from 6th street to have a quiet night's sleep. The only thing I can possibly suggest Kenny fix about this place is the shower. The water pressure wasn't the greatest and the tub doesn't drain very well. But nevertheless- we had a wonderful time and I would definitely stay here again next time I come to Austin. Thanks a lot Kenny!! "
,,,,,,,,"Staped with a group of four for a convention.  The central location was fantastic and made walking around downtown a breeze! Plus the free parking saved me a bunch compared to my previous trips to town for the same con.  All in all, it was a great place and Kenny was an excellent host."
,,,,,,,,Kenny is a great host. He was very responsive to questions. The location is perfect as noted in the description. 
,,,,,,,,"Very nice apartment, clean, quiet and conveniently located in downtown Austin, very close to the Convention Center."
,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent place to stay. Kenny was an great host, quick to respond to any questions but otherwise allowed us to be totally autonomous in the property. It's in the heart of the downtown, so was really a perfect location for anything we had planned to do while in Austin. I would recommend this to other visitors in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,Thank you for the spacious and comfortable space with a super convenient location! The parking spot is also a prime location. We had a great time.
,,,,,,,,"Super convenient in a great downtown location, and the parking space is a huge perk. Thanks, Kenny!"
,,,,,,,,"There is everything needed in the apartment, it's really better to stay here than a hotel room.
The bed is comfortable to sleep, and the room is quiet.
It will be great if there is a reading light in the living room, so I can read tourist map and information on the couch."
,,,,,,,,Kenny was a great host and gave us good recommendations for our first time visit to Austin. The place has a great location!!! 
,,,,,,,,Great experience. Able to walk to great restaurants and bars. Kenny was very responsive. 
,,,,,,,,"Kenny did a good job of answering questions when I had them and was very responsive throughout our visit. The place was very welcoming and comfortable for our stay. 

The listing was accurate and the neighborhood can't be beat. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and always easy to get a hold of your host Kenny.
,,,,,,,,"Great place in a great location.  We loved the setup and convenience.  Free parking is not easy to find downtown, which is a huge perk for this place."
,,,,,,,,Had a great time in Austin and couldn't have done it without the help of Kenny. Kenny was very accommodating to our needs. He allowed us to check in earlier and he made sure there was an iron & ironing board at the place for us. We had a group of 4 people and slept comfortably. The place was nicely kept & only 2 blocks from 6th street. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location and we had a great time in Austin. The apartment was a little worn when we got there, but definitely great value for the price. Host was quick to help out with an issue that arose!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was absolutely awesome. Being so close to the convention center and the city was such a great experience. Very clean, everything was all set for our stay from extra towels to magazines about Austin and city maps on the coffee table. Really just an excellent place to stay in Austin and a wonderful experience. Thanks Kenny!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was as pictured.  The kitchen and bedroom were quite large, and the entire unit was nicely furnished.  The lock box set up made check in and out very easy.  Kenny was available by text and gave us some flexibility on check out times, which was greatly appreciated.

The apartment location was very central, just a few blocks from 6th Street, the capital and the river.  We were able to walk just about everywhere we went.  The one downside of the location is that its  a popular area for those looking for the nightlife, especially on the weekends.  The building didn't quiet down until about 4:00 am on the Friday and Saturday night we were there, so if that's an issue for you, I'd think about another area in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great location in downtown austin, great food, music, and night life!  And quick access to the heart of the City for business."
,,,,,,,,This condo was the PERFECT location! Some girlfriends and I were in Austin for a bachelorette party. Easy walk to both 6th and Rainey streets where all the best bars are. Super spacious with double sinks and a rollout bed! Kenny was so helpful and accommodating. Super flexible on checkin and out times if necessary. Can't wait to come back! 
,,,,,,,,Kenny was great to work with and very accommodating with early check in and late check out. Always available by phone and gave great food recommendations as well. The unit was in the perfect location downtown and close to everything! Perfect place to use as a home base while exploring Austin for a few days! 
,,,,,,,,"listing was just as advertised, clean, very comfortable and great location!  Walking distance to South Congress, 6th street and the river path.  Kenny was very responsive and helpful when we had questions.  It was great to have a parking spot and not have to worry about finding parking each day.  "
,,,,,,,,As advertised. Location is great and place is clean. Kenny was very responsive with all communications. 
,,,,,,,,"The location was seriously perfect! We loved being able to walk to Congress, 6th and Rainey and all other sights were only a quick uber ride away. Unfortunately, the weather was bad so we weren't able to enjoy the pool but it looked really nice/clean. As others have mentioned in reviews, the apartment complex could be pretty noisy at times, especially since the bedroom window faces the courtyard. I would definitely recommend this spot for people who are looking for a ""home base"" while they explore all of Austin's fantastic neighborhoods. Kenny also provided us some good recommendations in advance of our trip, which was much appreciated."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed in this condo for a work conference. The location was great, not only to the hotel where the conference was being held, but also to several great places downtown. The home was very clean and quiet, and I especially liked all the city details of Austin that helped make it extra welcoming. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location.  Place was comfortable, clean and exactly as advertised.  "
,,,,,,,,"Kenny's place was amazing.  Exactly like the picture.  Clean.  Neighborhood location is fantastic and the parking can't be beat.  Kenny was super helpful as well.  All in all had a great stay and would do it again.

About the only downside was just like someone else warned the bedroom window faces an internal courtyard and this is downtown so there can be some noise at night but nothing prolonged or major."
,,,,,,,,"Kenny did a great job getting everything set for us. The location was perfect, we walked everywhere we needed to go, Franklins BBQ, South Congress, and everything downtown. Everything worked out perfect. Thanks Kenny, we will keep you in mind for the next trip down."
,,,,,,,,Apartment was as advertised.
,,,,,,,,Host was very easy to communicate with and made access instructions clear.
,,,,,,,,"Place was great, right next to downtown and a mere two blocks from convention center. Kenny immediately responded to all of our txts and was totally flexible to help make our stay smooth."
,,,,,,,,"The location was unbeatable. Being 2 blocks from 6th Street and the Congress Ave Bridge was really cool. We had a great time walking around downtown and the capital building. I didn't think that the parking space would be essential in Austin but it was for the amount of running around we did, it was awesome to have. Overall, the apartment was great for the 3 of us. The memory foam queen bed and memory foam rollaway bed was a very nice perk. Kenny was a great host and was attentive/responsive to all our needs. This place is definitely in a great area if you are traveling into town for SWSX or looking to experience Austin for the week/weekend. 

One thing to note about this apartment is that if you are a light sleeper, you might want to find another place. The neighbors can be a little loud really late at night (we are talking about 12:00 am-1:00 am) and if you are sensitive to that, you probably don't want to stay at this place.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin. Perfect location--close proximity to the Downtown area, 6th Street, Rainey Street. Parking lot was a major plus as well. Very accommodating--plenty of room in the apartment and several beds/couches available for use.  Perfect spot for our quick trip through Austin. "

,,,,,,,,Kenny's place was as advertised and is a great location for a business traveler who is working a conference at the Convention Center like I was.  
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time in Austin, TX and Kenny's place is the perfect spot to experience downtown.  It was just a few blocks from 6th street, close to the Lady Bird Trail, and a cheap cab or little walk to Rainey Street. 

The apartment is clean and like everyone else says the bed is VERY comfortable! I would highly suggest staying here."
,,,,,,,,"Had a great time in Austin....Kenny's place has a perfect location....central to all that Austin offers incuding easy access to the airport bus...the unit was spacious for just the two of us...Kenny responded quickly to communications, and was a very nice host...we hope to come back some time soon!"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment and location.  Perfect for a night out in Austin.

,,,,,,,,Really nice place right off 6th st. Super comfy bed and loved that it has parking too. We will be back! 
,,,,,,,,The place was exactly what we were looking for. It was spotless and the bed was super comfy.  Kenny made it easy breezy. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Place was neat and clean. Great location. The parking spot definitely came in handy, especially since parking around the area is horrific. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"I was in Austin for a conference downtown and this apartment was 2 blocks (5 min walk) from where I needed to be. Perfect location. It's very spacious with a big living room and large bedroom, plus lots of space in the kitchen. Kenny had just renovated the apartment so it was very clean and modern, but when I arrived I noticed there was no coffee maker like mentioned in the listing. Within minutes, Kenny responded to my message and dropped off a brand new coffee maker that evening. He was very responsive and helpful. The only other thing to note is that the listing mentions a free guest pass to a gym, but unfortunately that's not available anymore. All in all, I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,The apartment was in an AMAZING location.  Walkable to everything!  Apartment was perfect for a weekend in Austin.  Nice kitchen and the bed was super comfy!
,,,,,,,,"Kenny's apartment was in a perfect location to attend a conference at the Hilton and conference center, and near plenty of restaurants. The apartment is clean, convenient, and well appointed. I would recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"Smooth check-in, Kenny was very prompt and helpful with his responses. Great location! Would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was very helpful and accommodating, and made sure we had everything we needed.  The apartment is clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, with all sorts of interesting things to do well within walking distance."
,,,,,,,,The stay was great!
,,,,,,,,Everything was great and accurate!
,,,,,,,,"Clean, comfortable space with a killer location. The included parking space is a really great bonus, considering the usual difficulty and expense of finding parking downtown. Very simple check in and check out.  Not a single complaint!"
,,,,,,,,"This was perfect.  The location is awesome for exploring downtown Austin, the complex is very secure and quiet and the apartment is nice and clean.  Kenny was super nice and we had no issues with finding the place.  The reserved parking is always a welcome convenience as well.  Next time I come to Austin, I'll be checking if it's available again."
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was super accommodating with my last minute request and responded and approved me almost immediately. I can not say enough how awesome this place is. Very clean, adorable and probably the best spot in the city. You can walk everywhere. The gated parking area and entrance made me feel secure about being somewhere new. I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in austin . "
,,,,,,,,"Lovely apartment, nice living room, equipped kitchen, spacious bedroom - everything was perfect. Location downtown, close to everything. Kenny was there in a few minutes when I arrived and called him as discussed, no complaints at all."
,,,,,,,,This was great! Kenny was super nice and very accommodating when I needed him (which was only once). The place is nicely furnished and was a really great place to stay for me and my friends. It was the perfect home away from home for a short trip to Austin :)
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was perfect. Clean, well finished, and very well located for excursions throughout Austin. Kenny was very accommodating and made sure I arrived safely and had very thing I needed. Highly recommend and would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Kenny truly went above and beyond our expectations as a host.   He was prompt and communicative when we wanted to check in earlier and check out later.   The place was comfortable,  clean and in an absolutely perfect ""walking distance to everything"" location.  Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,Kenny was a great host . We texted him a few times with questions and he responded very quickly . The apartment is nice . Love the bed very comfortable . Everything is new . I also took advantage of the pool and  parking spot . I would highly recommend this place . 
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was a very welcoming host he answered all of my question before the trip began quickly and kindly! The neighborhood was amazing we absolutely loved the area. The place itself is very clean and cozy it perfectly accommodated my group for ACL. 2 blocks from 6th street- can't get better than that! I also had an issue with losing my keys before we were supposed to leave and Kenny was very accommodating and helpful in the situation! 

I would definitely recommend staying here for your next Austin adventure the location is perfect for anything you could want to do! "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in the best location for exploring downtown, tow blocks away from 6th street. Apartment was very clean and the bed was super comfortable. What you see in the pictures is exactly how the apartment looks, which I really appreciate since not all the time the pictures you see in the post match the actual place. 
Another thing: someone was parked in our spot, so I called Kenny and he took care of the problem, by the next morning the car parked in our spot was gone. And he also offered another parking spot in the meantime.
I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in a great place with an unbeatable location."
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect! I needed somewhere with a location easy to get around Austin (nailed it), comfortable (so cozy) and hassle free. It's walking distance to 6th street and is super easy to get to restaurants, bars, everything! I was there for work, and this was right next to the convention center, which was perfect. Kenny was also so helpful and nice. Plus the furniture in the house was fun - all Texas themed, which was really cool."
,,,,,,,,"This place was absolutely amazing! I highly recommend it and found it delightful and conveniently located. If you are going to Austin, this is a great place to stay for you trip : )"
,,,,,,,,"Kenny was great. The flat is in a really nice part of town with a lot of fun stuff in walking distance (restaurants, bars, etc). The place was well taken care of and felt really new and nice. Comfy couch too :)

I'd definitely stay again, thanks Kenny! "
,,,,,,,,"Kenny's place was great!  The location is prime, the bed was really comfortable, and it was super convenient to have a parking space included. The place was also clean and seemed safe since it's all gated. Thanks Kenny! Looking forward to another visit hopefully!"
10635135,4.5,9,10,9,9,10,9,The listing was exactly as described.  It was a close walk to everything in Downtown Austin.  The house was clean and matched the descriptions and seems like a very good value.
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Tyler was easy to reach upon arrival. Super comfortable bed. The place was simple and well kept, which I found perfect for my boyfriend and I's stay. The location is also awesome- you're right in downtown and behind some of my favorite eats in Austin (24 Diner and Counter Cafe). It's quite a cool place!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect experience all around.  Great location, spectacular views and a welcoming host.  I highly recommend Tyler's bungalow for anyone planning a trip to Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"Home was cute, clean and cozy!"
,,,,,,,,Great location for access to downtown. Host was really helpful and responsive
,,,,,,,,"this residence is in an interesting location, with a great view.
The host took great care to ensure check in was smooth, and provided off-street parking (thanks).

However, this house is in dire need of some basic maintenance, including exterior paint, the steps and stone walk, shrubs at front, trash and litter in parking area.  Several lamps and light bulbs didn't work.  The refrigerator was dirty.  And although there was not a mention of a working TV, the lack of same should be noted in the listing given this is a rather ordinary and expected feature.
"
,,,,,,,,"As is stated in the listing, the stairs leading up to the room are rather steep, just steep enough to put my 71-year old father in a bit of a mood. The location is excellent and Tyler was great as far as communication. The only real issue we found were that the bedsheets had a slight musty odor, like maybe they hadn't been washed? This was just a minor thing though. Would recommend the room, maybe just to younger people who don't mind a little city noise."
,,,,,,,,"I should have paid attention to Martin's comments.  The price asked for the apartment sets expectations: like, apartment cleaned before my arrival; hot water in the bathroom sink; light bulbs that work; furnace that actually heats; and, a fridge that has been wiped down in recent memory. "
,,,,,,,,"Hope we got it right as far as communication.
You did not charge for time we were there, as we left  do to unexpected circumstances  causing
us to vacate.
"
,,,,,,,,Great location! Awesome city views and close to the graffiti wall. Would recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was very accommodating! I booked on short notice and in spite of that, everything was set up and checking in was painless. Tyler himself was there to ensure that I didn't have any issues off the bat, and even offered up his parking spot to me in case street parking wasn't good. The place itself was in an excellent location and is reasonably priced. A lot of great restaurants and bars were within walking distance.

I also enjoyed the heck out of Simpsons Season 4 the Halo 2 on XBox."
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's place is in need of attention, especially when considering the price. The fridge was dirty on arrival and the oven had old pizza. The kitchen is minimal and not even really useful for reheating (no microwave)

The place has been furnished on a budget including bed linen and towels.

There is a TV in the living room which is useless unless you wish to play Xbox or watch the supplied old movies. There are no channels. Tyler suggested hooking up the computer with supplied cable, but when you do this the sound does not work, only video."
,,,,,,,,Awesome place...I would definitely stay again
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was very helpful and helped make our stay comfortable and convenient. He provided thorough instructions and details about the place, and immediately responded to our inquiries. Very simple check-in and check-out process. The location is awesome. We loved the graffiti park and the view of downtown from the entrance of the place.  I am glad to have had such a positive experience overall."
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was very easy to contact. After we arrived & realized we probably needed the air mattress for our fourth guest, he was very accommodating & willing to get the air mattress from one of his other listings up the hill from where we stayed. The space was clean for the most part minus some minor housekeeping things, the bed was SO COMFORTABLE & it was a cute little space. I was a little confused on which listing we would be staying at because he has three total listings in Austin, but I was pleased with the listing we got and how flexible Tyler was when we had to add a fourth person. The neighborhood is quiet & safe, considering it is right off the busy street of Lamar. We walked to the bars on 6th street, and walked home after bar close without feeling unsafe or that the walk was too far. It's right up the hill from 24 hour diner, and definitely within walking distance to 6th street. I would definitely stay here at Tyler's again! "
,,,,,,,,"Tyler is a great host, while we never saw each other, he was highly attentive and ensured our check in/ check out was great. His place is as described on his listing and delivers on location, value, and customer service. His attention to serving his clients is top notch and I am glad I was blessed with a great host. Tyler addressed all of my concerns and is devoted to improve his guests experience."
,,,,,,,,Great. 
,,,,,,,,Tyler was super communicative and it was a great location with fantastic air conditioning.  
,,,,,,,,Great communication. Loved everything about the experience except for the disappointment in expectation for fitting 4 comfortably.
,,,,,,,,Great location and clean. The graffiti wall right out front is definitely a site to see.
,,,,,,,,"Can't ask for a better location!
I live in austin, and rented this just to get away from my house! Got to paint right next door."
,,,,,,,,"Location was walking distance to many places to eat and shop.  The graffiti wall is cool to check out as well.  The place was quiet, nice porch area, A/C worked well, and the washer/dryer was a nice bonus.

Tyler was helpful with allowing an early check-in.  Much appreciated!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location right next to the Graffiti Park, private parking and nice environment. I loved staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"Loved the space! Very clean and open. Tyler is very responsive. Directions were easy to follow. 

I love the location, honestly doesn't get much better. The art wall is something really neat to check out and it's like right next door. He has great speakers so it was fun to bump some music. Wish we booked it for another night 


I would recommend for a short or long term stay to a single person or couple. My two buddies and I slept comfortably... One on the couch and two shared a bed for the night

I hope the space is available next time I'm in Austin, I'd book it again in a heartbeat"
,,,,,,,,Tyler's place is an excellent place to stay and I would highly recommend it. The house was very clean and comfortable. Great proximity to downtown and excellent views!
,,,,,,,,Tyler was super communitive throughout the booking and my arrival process. He's got great taste in music and you can't really beat the location!
,,,,,,,,Great place!
,,,,,,,,Incredibly convenient to Austin's main attractions. Tyler helped us with anything that came up and provided clear instructions so there were no hiccups in our stay. 100% would come back and stay at his place again.
,,,,,,,,Great host.  Accommodated us checking in sooner and we overlapped with another guest who was also super chill
,,,,,,,,"This is everything they say it is. Had a buddy in town and we used Tyler's place as a launch pad to enjoy Austin for an evening. It's an older house in a unique location with that great view of that spans from The Capitol all the way downtown. Really comfortable bed, good AC and has the added bonus of the Hope Art Gallery next door! Tyler was accommodating and kept in touch before my stay to make sure we were set. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Tyler's home was great. Things were set up for us, and he was very helpful/flexible. The location couldn't be better.. The only thing is that the street parking by the house is 2 hours only M-F during the day, so we had to keep moving our second car "
,,,,,,,,"What. A. Location. Right next to the graffiti tourist attraction. Cool bungalow with an amazingly comfortable bed. Parking for one vehicle, the rest of the guests can park on the street. During the day is crazy but at night there's a lot of parking. A small turn table to play the vinyl records (which are awesome, great albums). I literally had no issues. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Tylers place is in such a hot location, it's a hard place to pass up. Literally right next door to the outdoor hope gallery. Easy access to anything Downtown if you have a car. Great cozy place to be in and can't pass up the record collection!"
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place in the heart of Austin. Close to everything! Home is very cozy and right next door to one of the greatest photo stops known to man kind. Would definitely recommend to friends and family!
,,,,,,,,"Tyler has a great set up here, close to everything or at most a 3-5 minute Uber to all the hot spots including 6th street. Please was clean, speakers set up, and everything needed was set up and ready for us. We had a great time and enjoyed our time at Tyler's Airbnb, couldn't ask for more. Thank you again"
,,,,,,,,Amazing host and neighborhood
,,,,,,,,"Host responded right away and helped with parking. Great location, extremely close to the west 6th street downtown. Can be busy out front because of the graffiti park which is also cool to check out. Would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"The stay was really awesome! It was exactly what I expected and everything was described perfectly in the info. Tyler set out everything very nice for us and we loved it. Great view from the porch, and very easy to get downtown. Might have to come back"
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was a great host. He quickly responded to the request and to my questions. He was willing to help with anythong that I needed. The place was in a great location, few minutes from UT or 6th st. The house was cozy, and everything needed was in the house. I didnt find luxury but i felt like home. A would definitely reccomend Tyler to anyone else, and also use him in the future again. "
,,,,,,,,Everything was good and I had a nice stay at this cozy little space on top of a hill! The sheets were nice and satiny and very comfy. The place is not sparkling clean but you cannot complain for the location and wonderful quirkiness of a tiny hidden house on a hill.
,,,,,,,,"Great view of the Austin downtown area.  Close to the University of Texas and super cafes and restaurants.  Tyler had a nice bottle of wine chilled and waiting, and gave up his parking place!  Thanks a bunch!!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice clean place with character.  Great location as well, next to the graffiti park. Tyler is friendly and easy going, he offered me some wine as well and that's a winner host status in my book.  I will definitely book it again."
,,,,,,,,"The house was comfortable and the host was very responsive anything that needed fixing was fixed within hours with that being said the place is a little old , with small bathroom and a really lumpy full size bed. The place could use some curtains because the thunderstorms kept us away all night. The place is near a famous graffiti wall structure that a lot of tourists and locals visit so it can be loud at night. The place is close to wholefoods and the host is very accommodating and welcoming which adds to the place. Quaint place good for the party goers not if you seeking quiet and comfort."
,,,,,,,,I had a great experience at Tyler's home. It was quite spacious and the view from the location was truly amazing. The fact that it was so close to everything you could need made it even better. I would definitely be coming back in the future. 
,,,,,,,,"Great experience for checking out Austin. The location was perfect with the graffiti walls right next to us and just minutes away from tons of restaurants and bars. Tyler definitely made us feel welcome with a very clean apartment and helpful instructions for exploring the city and using Airbnb, as it was my first time staying with a host. "
,,,,,,,,"Thank you very much. The house is interesting. Clear instructions,quickly found and opened the house.Great location for our purposes. Had not enough for super experience: any utensil for cooking and linens for children's beds."
,,,,,,,,Tyler's was very accommodating and responded promptly to any of my questions. His place was clean and the location is great.  Convenient store and breakfast a block away.  
,,,,,,,,"Loved the space, had everything we needed for a fun weekend.  Loved the hand soap, smelled so yummy and the memory foam topper on the mattress was so comfy.  The house was right next door to the grafitti wall, which was very cool. Tyler was flexible with checkin and check out times. Also had shiner in the fridge."
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was very  accommodating nothing to complain about. The place was as described and his perfect to have a quiet space for a few days in Austin. Not downtown, but pretty central still. A few minutes from the downtown are in a Lyft or car.
"
5205244,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Dolma was a fantastic host. She waited an extra 45 minutes for us, due to our flight being late. She was very responsive and catered to our every annoying quest and request. The place was exactly as description. Comfy bed and fun patio to relax on.  "
,,,,,,,,Dolma's home is as wonderful as she is. Great location. Lovely and comfortable. Lots of light. Quiet. A wonderful place from which to explore the city. 
,,,,,,,,"Once again Dolma was an amazing host. Easy to deal with, accomodating and even after we left, she contacted us regarding an item we left behind and organised it to be posted back to us.

Great place, modern, fantastic kitchen, central location. You can't ask for any better."
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was ideal for a business traveler who needs close proximity to the core area of Austin. I was a few blocks walk from Congress Ave and close to the best coffee shops in the city including Medici, Halcyon and Houndstooth.

The apartment was modern, clean, and had all amenities including decent wifi, washer/dryer and a fully loaded kitchen. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom included a tub which was a good touch.

Dolma was warm and accommodating on arrival. She clearly takes pride in this apartment and wants to ensure you have a good stay.

The Apartment looks out onto a great pool area without any noise issues.

Highly recommended!
"
,,,,,,,,Great host and amazing apartment. The complex has a really good gym and pool area as well. And the perfect location if you want to be in a central location. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Dolma's flat was great, very spacious, clean and ideally located. Dolma was a great host too, she provided useful tips for restaurants. All in all greatly enjoyed my stay in Austin and would definitely recommend staying at Dolma's."
,,,,,,,,"Dolma was very helpful. The apartment was great- everything I expected and needed. 
The location is awesome!"
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment at a great location in Austin. Dolma was very responsive and waiting for us when we arrived, so that was all very smooth. Apartment was clean and tidy. Location is perfect. Dolma left recommendations for restaurants. We followed a few and they were all very good."
,,,,,,,,"Dolma was very welcoming and friendly.  Beautiful apartment - clean, well-decorated, and fantastic amenities in the complex (business center, relaxing swimming pool, pool house, and gym).  Great location as well."
,,,,,,,,This condo is in a great location - walking distance to most things. The building is very nice and has a great pool and gym available to you. Dolma was easy to work with and flexible. 
,,,,,,,,"Dolma was a great host and was extremely easy to connect with at all times. Her place was in the perfect location with an incredible pool and workout gym. The location could not be any better. The pictures and descriptions were exactly the way she posted. I would recommend this condo to anyone in a second. Dolma also had great recommendations on local coffee shops, restaurants, etc.... She was great! We will hopefully go back soon. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in a great location downtown. Clean, modern apt with a nice gym and pool. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Dolma was an excellent host - was extremely flexible with my checkin time and stocked the place with all the amenities I could have needed.  The place itself was a beautifully furnished unit overlooking the building's pool, and a prime location blocks away from great restaurants and bars downtown. I'm definitely hoping it's available next time I'm in town! "
,,,,,,,,"This listing is 100% as advertised. It is a spacious and comfortable apartment that is very tastefully decorated. The decor is modern but calming. Little details like carefully arranged plants and beautifully scented hand soaps really made my experience. The apartment was an excellent alternative to staying at a downtown hotel. We had also considered staying a bit out of the city because we're from NYC and we like the outer borough experience, but we made the right choice in choosing to stay downtown. The central location gave us the opportunity to do a lot of walking around and we had plenty to do. We rented a car for a day to hit all of our out-of-city agenda items. And though the BnB is right in the middle of the city, it is SUPER quiet in the apartment. Dolma was a gracious and professional host who responded to every one of my inquiries promptly, thoroughly, and thoughtfully. She even met us at midnight to hand us the keys and give us a quick run of the place. We happened to arrive with a packed agenda, but I really appreciated the detailed guest book that Dolma put together."
,,,,,,,,"Dolma was a fantastic host -- very communicative and flexible. The apartment is wonderful -- neat, clean, well appointed -- and in a great location. I will definitely try to stay here next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Dolma was a great host! She met me right when I arrived and gave me a tour of the apartment. She also had a great list of recommended spots to eat that were around the corner, across the way, or nearby - all of which were highly recommended by locals around town!

The apartment was in the center of everything and was just minutes from my work office that I was visiting. It was super easy to get in and out of the building and the apartment building itself had great amenities for any visitor of Austin. 

I'll definitely try and book again in future Austin trips.

Thanks Dolma!"
,,,,,,,,"Dolma was incredibly hospitable and easy to contact / connect with. The apartment was very clean and well laid out. There were 2x of us staying at this location and we found the quarters to be both spacious and comfortable. Being at SXSW for work, we found this location to be perfect to get to and from our event location, as well as to other nearby events and restaurants. 

I would highly recommend this location and host! "
,,,,,,,,"Dolma is wonderful.  A perfect, flexible and accommodating host,  helpful with tips about Austin. The apartment is stylish,  beautiful,  comfortable and light. And extremely central. I couldn't have had a better experience.  THANK YOU."
,,,,,,,,"Dolma's place was in the perfect location, close to everything! Thanks for everything! "
,,,,,,,,"A wonderful place, very spacious, stylish decoration that reveals Dolma's love for interior design, lots of sunlight, and very tidy. Walking distance to the river opens up lots of nearby outdoor activities, and to downtown gives quick access to a variety of restaurants, bars, and cafes. Dolma was super-helpful. She introduced us to the things to do and see in the neighborhood. She made sure we had everything we needed and was readily available when we had questions. We felt very comfortable, were super-happy and highly recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"Visiting with my wife for a long weekend, this was a great, great, great, spot to stay. Dolma's condo was cute, spacious, clean and a perfectly located to explore the city. Lots of coffee shops, restaurants, shops and bars within walking distance (we tried to cover as many as we could out of Dolma's recommendations list). There is a really cool cinema just around the building, and some of the best coffee I had in the states within a few blocks away (cade medici). Dolma had great communication and was a gracious host, she really made it feel like our place for a few days.
We will definitely stay here again in our next trip to Austin, and so I would recommend to everyone else!"
,,,,,,,,"First of all, Dolma is a wonderful host. She was highly responsive and flexible in our communication leading up to my stay. Dolma met me at her apartment to do a quick walkthrough and offered suggestions for the area (always appreciated.) Having used Airbnb about a dozen times now, I'd say she was above the average in genuinely wanting me to enjoy my stay.

The apartment itself is modern, clean, and tastefully decorated. It's location is a short walk from fun areas downtown, but was pretty quiet. It was too cold to use the pool, but the gym access was a bonus and had plenty of equipment and space. 

I would highly recommend renting this space to any vacation or business traveler!"
4013309,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Ted was excellent at cordinating our arrival. We arrived very late @ 12:30 am. He personally met us outside the lot and guided us to our parking spot and handed us our apartment keys. 
The apartment was thoughtfully stocked and warmly furnished. The kitchen had everything we needed and the living room had board games. 
We called Ted up one time because we were trying to work the TV remote and he was extremely helpful to get the TV sorted. He even offered to come back early from a family dinner which was very kind of him to offer.
Location was great - it was close to the bars, restaurants and trails. 
We would highly recommend staying at Ted's and had an fantastic time while we were there"
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience at Ted's place. The townhouse is clean and modern and in a great location. The rooftop deck alone makes it worth it. Would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,Ted was the perfect host. The place was easy to find and had all the amenities needed to enjoy Austin. Ted knew all about Austin and was very helpful with advice about town. We would look forward to staying again!
,,,,,,,,"Ted is a great guy and his place is clean, convenient to downtown and charming to boot. I will definitely stay there next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay. Ted is an outstanding host and ensures your comfort. 
,,,,,,,,This is a great litttle place that has everything you need. The six pack a assorted Shiner was a nice touch too. 
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place and experience. Stayed for a business trip. Was super clean, and quiet at night. Ted met us out front upon arrival. Location was great for walking and riding bike share b-cycles everywhere! Highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Ted's place was perfect. Clean, walking distance to a lot of great spots and communication was excellent. Would definitely stay here again. Also, the 6-pack of beers to greet us was a nice touch. 10/10"
,,,,,,,,"Ted's place was great. An easy walk to 6th Street, very clean, easy parking and extremely well equipped. There are also nice places to sit outside. The 6 pack of local beer in the fridge was a nice touch!"
,,,,,,,,"Spent a fantastic weekend in Ted's townhouse. Very easy last minute booking, spotless, comfortable place. The local beers waiting in the fridge were a nice touch, will stay again. "
,,,,,,,,Great stay. Place was clean and exactly as shown in the photos. The balcony provided a great place to relax and we were a very easy walking distance to 6th st and many restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Great location and beautiful spot!!!  Fantastic check in and welcome. However, the first guest room has ants IN. THE. BED.  A LOT of ants. But it was still a lovely place and we would rent there again in a heartbeat. Fantastic check in and welcome. "
,,,,,,,,"Ted was a phenomenal host. He was very accommodating and patient with a fairly rowdy bachelor party group. The house was comfortable, and the rooftop patio is very nice. It is walkable to 6th street, but there are also rentable (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) bikes across the street. "
,,,,,,,,The house was great. Checking in was easy and the house came with everything we needed. The rooftop is perfect. Also very walkable to a lot of great restaurants and bars.  My friends and I enjoyed our stay here very much.
,,,,,,,,The location was fantastic! Ted was an amazing host - there was a very detailed book to help find wonderful activities around the city and they even welcomed us with some Texas beer. There was six of us and we were all very comfortable. The rooftop balcony was also a highlight - we had a lovely breakfast up there one morning. We had an amazing experience and I would love to stay there again.
,,,,,,,,"Gracious and welcoming hosts welcomed us even with a slightly early check-in time. 

The home was beautiful, well kept and wonderfully located. It had everything we needed, including a great list of local eats and even spare umbrellas in case of rain.

I look forward to coming back for another visit."
,,,,,,,,Ted's place was wonderful. Exactly how it was described in the listing. Great location. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"My husband and 3 young boys stayed and we all had a great time. It was decorated very clean, simple and rustic modern. There were plenty of sheets and towels. There was ground coffee in the fridge and a pitcher of cold water which was nice. The only thing I didn't realize was there were no bathtubs (only showers) so bathing my kids was tough, but that was not a biggie. There was a cool ladder on the second floor that led to the third floor and roof deck. We blocked off with chairs because the ladder was too steep and very high. The living room was cozy with a cool little area under the stair of games. There was laundry machine there which was great to have with the little kids. We heard tons of birds chirping at 6am which was kinda neat. 

Janelle was very nice. Only saw her when we checked in and made it clear that if we needed anything she was a few steps away. Being that she's on the property too I wasn't sure if we would see her a lot, but there's a separate private entrance behind the house so it really didn't feel like we were at her house. 

Great location!  Close enough to downtown and the capital but off in a quiet historical part of town. 

We were hoping for a later checkout because our flight left at 5pm, but because of other guest coming janelle couldn't accommodate. So if this happens to you- we went to the Westin on 5th street and were able to use there roof top pool for free (sun-thurs open to the public) it was a cool 3ft pool with a shallow area for kids. We ordered lunch from their restaurant, swam then ubered to the airport. You do need a hotel key to access and all you have to do is check in at the front and for free they give you a key!!  2 burgers, a salad and 3 watt was $75, but worth it for the ambiance. 

Overall I would absolutely book this house again!!  "
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I absolutely loved staying at the ""treehouse"" - it's a beautiful place, walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go and, best of all, Ted and his wife were incredible hosts. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Ted and Janelle were the most amazing Air BNB hosts we have had. We were there for a girls trip and bachelorette weekend and we were greeted with a 6 pack of local beer in the fridge with a little note.  Ted was available for constant communication with me from booking all the way to check out.   The house is adorable and very very clean.  It is a very convenient walk to 6th and the capital building.  Uber and Lyft are great as well.  I would definitely recommend this place!  When we go back to Austin, we will def try to book with them again.  They were great!"
,,,,,,,,"Ted and his wife were there to greet us even a bit before our agreed time which was convenient for me and my friends. After a quick tour, they let us be and we had the place to ourselves for the rest of the weekend. The house is exactly as it's depicted in the pictures. Location is good. Quiet, and close enough to downtown and restaurants for a quick ride. Our favorite feature was the patio on the roof."
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience here at Ted's place in Austin.  The house was in great condition and was in a great location.  We had a short five minute walk to Sixth Street for all the restaurants and bars. The balcony upstairs was a perfect outdoor space to have privacy and relax in the middle of the city.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
,,,,,,,,"Our stay here was wonderful! Our group was here for the Austin Marathon,  and this place was walking distance to the start/finish lines, along with lots of eateries and pubs. Ted and his wife made us feel right at home. The house was nice and clean, and the kitchen was stocked with essentials to make and serve simple meals. We will most definitely be revisiting!"
,,,,,,,,Ted was a great host.  The house was great and was very close to all the restaurants and bars downtown.
,,,,,,,,House was perfect!! Locations clutch!! Ted was great! 
,,,,,,,,This was a perfect spot for our party of 5 for a weekend of eating and drinking around Austin. Definitely walkable to downtown. The rooftop is a major bonus. The hosts are wonderful and have thought of everything for this well-appointed airbnb. Highly recommend it. 
,,,,,,,,"I met our host(ess) Janelle at their home, which is shared with the property that we(nyself, fiance and 2 friends from Boston) stayed at, and she was as sweet as chocolate pie! :-)  We had an itinerary, but if we didn't, they have this neat red book with things to do, restaurants, shops, etc.  And the hosts were just a text/phone call away.  They were very responsive before we even got there!

We had everything we needed and more - there were little trial sized contact solution, toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, shampoo, pitcher of cold water in the fridge, extra towels, pillows, etc; just considerate, thoughtful things that you may completely forget about!

The location was great, and the rooftop deck was beautiful - super walkable to downtown and to the capitol.  If it was a little warmer, we would have walked everywhere!

I loved it - next time we visit, I'll be using Ted & Janelle's townhouse again!"
,,,,,,,,Ted was incredibly accommodating. The location was wonderful and we will return.
,,,,,,,,"Spacious and comfortable spot, well situated for downtown access. A bit noisy late at night (looks onto an alley and municipal parking lot) but otherwise very decent accommodation."
,,,,,,,,"Great, great, great!!! The house is in a lovely neighborhood, walking distance of the 6th street, where all the activity of Austin takes place.  The house is impecably clean, perfect for a small group (we were 4 adults and two kids), it has EVERYTHING we needed to make us feel at home and to make our week so easy.  Ted & Janelle are wonderful hosts, who have thought of all the amenities one needs when traveling and the house is well equiped."
,,,,,,,,"This house was perfect for our group of 4. It is nice and clean, had all of the amenities we needed and was a perfect location for us. It is walking distance to downtown, and not far from campus either.  Would definitely stay again when going to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"This is a really beautiful accommodation in a perfect location.  It is impeccably clean, and all the amenities have been thoughtfully provided.  There are 2 lovely decks if you want to relax outside.  The property is stylishly decorated, with attention to detail and comfort.  We used the laundry facilities which was a very nice extra.  Though we didn't use the kitchen, it also had been thoughtfully equipped.  I loved it here; though we were only staying a few nights, it felt like home and I would love to return and stay longer."
,,,,,,,,"By far exceeded our expectations! Ted and Janelle have a wonderful home on property, and were there if we needed anything. The townhouse is a great layout and worked out perfectly for our group of 6. It was nice having plenty of space, and two bathrooms. We plan to book again in the future. 

Thomas C. "

323733,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This is an awesome place to stay! It was clean attractive and spacious. The location was perfect, close to great dining experiences and nightlife. "
,,,,,,,,"Erik did a great job of communicating with me prior to arriving. His emails and directions get straight to the point.

The location is perfect and just about close to everything in Austin. 

Definitely recommending! "
,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal had everything laid out on a PDF that we needed during our stay.  We checked in late at night, so it was nice to have perfect instructions to get in to the unit.    They had great recommendations  for restaurants and things to do."
,,,,,,,,The property was exactly as described. The location was superb. Walking distance to everything. Erik and Crystal were super accomodating. Even hand delivering a package that Erik allowed me to ship to his home.
,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal's condo is in an excellent downtown (URL HIDDEN) many bars, restaurants, & shops in the surrounding area. It was a great home base for us to explore other areas. There is even a great yoga studio just across the street! The complex can be a little confusing to navigate, with 3 levels and not many staircases to access the different areas, but we eventually got the hang of it. Erik & Crystal were very communicative and accommodating in regard to check-in/check-out. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,Very quick and easy communication.  The location to the convention center and downtown in general is primo.
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's place is so perfectly located. You can walk basically anywhere. It's very cool on the inside. The beds are so comfortable and the kitchen has everything you could want. Awesome place, highly recommended. As hosts they're responsive and helpful. Stay here if you visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Erik was a great communicator and helped make the stay for my brother and parents an easy one when last minute circumstances dictated that I could not travel. We appreciated his flexibility tremendously and everyone said they had a great stay at Erik's apartment.
,,,,,,,,"The location in Austin is perfect! Easily walkable to 6th Street, Rainey Street, etc. This place is very comfortable for 4 people but can sleep up to 6 easily. "
,,,,,,,,Fantastic apartment in a wonderful location. Had a great stay. Thanks.
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location close to everything in downtown. Comfortable apartment with great amenities and quiet neighbors!

,,,,,,,,lovely apartment in a great location. the flat is clean. homely and full of modern amenities. fast and friendly communication with Erik & Crystal. would definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal were great hosts. They were very responsive and very accomodating with our requests. They let us drop our bags early before check in and leave them there longer after check out as well. The location of the house is great, (walking distance from the fun of 6th street). The only issue we ran into is the building complex shut down the water twice on the day we had a wedding to get ready for so this was a bit stressful. This of course was out of Erik & Crystal's control and they were very communicative apologetic about it. Overall great experience, great hosts and I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's place was very comfortable and in a fantastic location, would definitely recommend for anyone spending a few nights in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"In looking for an airbnb location, I was looking for a centrally located spot as I was in town visiting with friends and we wanted a central location to be able to get around downtown without renting a car, - Erik and Crystal's loft was perfect and couldn't have been more convenient.  

We got everything we needed nearby, be it coffee, a quick bite, getting to CVS, or renting bikes.  The Metro bus stop nearby was also really convenient for getting to and from the airport - a nice tip from Erik and Crystal.  Communication from them was timely, detailed, clear, and we got great overall advice that made our stay very easy.  We had no issues at all.

We had all the kitchen and bathroom amenities needed, Wi-fi was solid, A/C kept us cool, the washer and dryer were helpful, and the apartment had plenty of space whether folks were catching up on rest or catching up with each other.  It was perfect for our stay."
,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal have a lovely place in a perfect location downtown Austin.  Their communication was clear, helpful and timely. I was staying for work, but would definitely come back to stay for a vacation! "
,,,,,,,,Great location!
,,,,,,,,Fantastic location and host. Everything was smooth and the host communicated clearly and promptly. I look forward to staying here for my next trip.

,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal have such a cute place. Hosts are very responsive and so helpful with recommendations in the neighborhood. Check-in was a breeze and everything within the condo was clean and pristine. Everything you need is within walking distance with well lit streets so you don't need a car (tho if you do there is a reserved spot within a gated lot). Highly recommend this location if you want to check out the Capitol, 6th St (1min walk) or Rainey St (10min walk)."
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful hosts, everything was perfect. We didn't feel like tourist, we actually had the Austin Experience. Hoping this place is available for the next trip! Thank you Erik and Crystal for everything.. 


P.S. We enjoyed the LoneStars left behind! "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location! Steps from the convention centre, 6th street and all the best of Austin. 

Place was perfect! Had all amenities and was wonderfully cold in the boiling hot summer. Magical pool on site! "
,,,,,,,,Amazing location and beautiful apartment! Would stay there again in a second.
,,,,,,,,The host was helpful with arrival and departure times and the place was looking great when we arrived.
,,,,,,,,"Communicated Well, really nice and open"
,,,,,,,,"We definitely enjoyed the stay! Great location and super easy access! The other groups in the complex were loud. But other than that the experience was amazing. The condo was just what we needed. It was clean and had all the little amenities we forgot, like hair dryers! "
,,,,,,,,"The loft was great! Our hosts were extremely responsive to any questions asked before and during our stay. The location is EXTREMELY convenient to the convention center, JW Marriott (where our conference was) and other downtown venues. We enjoyed our visit. Thank you Erik & Crystal!"
,,,,,,,,"The condo was amazing! Plenty of room for the family. It was great to have a place to use as ""home base"" that wasn't a hotel room. This is a 100X a hotel - especially if you're on a longer stay or have options to bring in groceries. 

Erik and Crystal did everything possible to make the stay great; I had some extra complexity in my stay with dual billing. Erik made sure that was their problem to deal with and not mine. 

The location was perfect for our needs. Close to bus routes, 6th st, my conference ... I will caution that restaurant options get pretty sparse at 10PM. "
,,,,,,,,This loft was perfect for me and my friends! We were in Austin for a local convention and it was perfectly located! Everything was clean and comfortable!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, loved it"
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood in the heart of the city! We honestly didn't spend
much time in the house, but were very comfortable when we did
especially when running the AC, which proved essential for June in Austin. Everything was accurately described and it was a very homie
place that makes you feel like you're living as a local. Eric was great
whenever we needed anything(which wasn't much) and we would highly recommend this to others. Thanks guys!"
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay and the best location in Austin! You can walk to all of the hot spots and their place also has a great pool!
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal were awesome (beer and water in the fridge :)). They were flexible on the check-in time, which was very important in my case. Communication was easy. The listing was 100% accurate. The neighborhood is great."
,,,,,,,,Erik and Crystal's condo is great! It was just as described! We were welcomed prior to our visit with informative emails and once we arrived everything was clean and ready to go! I would stay there again if I traveled to Austin. Great location and overall great spot to host a big or small group. The multiple sinks and mirrors were also a definite plus for a bunch of girls! :)
,,,,,,,,"Great experience. Super ressponsive, apt was clean and ready on time. Had everything we needed. Simple check in / check out. Loved Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Host was very responsive at all times reference the listing!  Great location and great accommodations within the complex (pool/access/parking).  In a very walkable part of town, but also easy access to the highway."
,,,,,,,,Great location.  Great hosts.  Would stay there again if I was in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Great little apartment in the PERFECT location in downtown Austin! Walkable to 6th street music & bars, the Convention Center, Lady Bird Lake trails, and Rainey Street, we couldn't have asked for a better location. The apartment was clean, well-equipped and cute. For the most part, it was quiet, except for Saturday night when neighbors were enjoying some late night shenanigans. Working with Erik & Crystal was great, they were super communicative & easy to connect with - and they also let us check out late when they found out we didn't have flights out until the evening. Overall, great experience! I would certainly book this apartment again when returning to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location and even better apartment.  It was really nice being close to downtown and not having to stay in some one room hotel.
"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at the loft! Erik and Crystal left a bottle of wine on the table for our arrival which was lovely! The loft is exactly as advertised and perfect for four people getting away for a weekend. Location is perfect, you can walk everywhere you need to go, and a very short uber ride to anywhere you don't feel like walking to.  The best part is the yoga studio and juice bar across the street. We can't wait for our next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Beautiful condo in an amazing location. Allowed us to take in all of Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Amazing loft, loction, and unbelievably responsive and accommodating hosts.  "
,,,,,,,,"We met Erik at the apartment and found him to be very welcoming and helpful. The apartment was as advertised: well equipped, clean, quiet, plenty of hot water, towels and well situated. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, apartment just as described. Would definitely stay again.  Thanks for a terrific stay! "
,,,,,,,,Quaint loft in a great location. Very clean and spacious. Had no complaints! Host provided us with great recommendations of things to do and places to eat near the loft location and all over Austin. Would highly reccomend to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,"My colleagues and I just had a great stay at this loft. It's spacious, well appointed, and contact with the owners is fluid and frequent. Walking distance to all the things you came to see and do with easy check-in and out procedures. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,," A friend and I spent two nights at the 4th St Loft and found it to be in a perfect location for walking around central Austin. Tons of restaurants, bars, etc nearby.  We were even able to walk to the Capitol and the Texas History museum. The hosts were very helpful as well as flexible about our check-out time. Easy entry with a key code and very comfortable beds.  

We stayed over a Saturday night and there was a great deal of noise from people on the motel-like walkways all through the night.  However it was very quiet on Sunday night. The loft itself is quite dark and it's hard to keep the blinds open as the windows open onto the walkways which doesn't provide much privacy. But those are minor complaints and I would definitely recommend this loft to anyone looking for a perfect location."
,,,,,,,,Erik & Crystal made check-in and out process a real breeze. Had no problems getting in or out. Everything was clean and have a wonderful place.
,,,,,,,,Great Place! Great Trip! The location of this condo was perfect. We walked everywhere. Loved the bottle of wine Erik and Crystal left us and there was tons of rooms for 2 ladies to get ready! They also texted me right away which always puts me at ease after booking. We would for sure stay here again and we highly recommend it. 
,,,,,,,,Erik and Crystal made the rental so easy and were great in offering suggestions on places to visit for both food and drink. The location of their condo is perfect. plenty close enough to all the spots downtown you want to visit and a short Lyft/Uber ride away from others.
,,,,,,,,The apartment on 4th St was fantastic!  Check in and out is so easy and Erik/Crystal were very communicative and accommodating.  Would definitely stay again!!!
,,,,,,,,Erik & Crystal's place was beyond perfect for our girls weekend. It had everything we needed and the location was unbeatable. Walking distance to all of downtown Austin's hotspots and a short uber ride to places like South Congress and Rainey St. Would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to anyone!
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for my friends and I. Both beds were great and the couch made for a comfortable third bed. The location is unbeatable, whether you want to go out exploring or go to the bars nearby, its perfect. Erik & Crystal also gave us some fantastic tips of local cafe's, bars and restaurants to try out which was a big help! Highly recommend staying here and would again if I was in Austin again in the future."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was cozy and super convenient. Walking distance, as advertised, to tons of cool stuff to do downtown in Austin. Erik and Crystal were also very responsive and super nice. We had a great weekend and would happily stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Erik and Crystal's was perfect. The check in and check out process was simple and smooth - they were very accommodating with our larger group in terms of check out and arrival times. The apartment itself was super cute and perfect for a group of 6. The location is amazing - within walking distance to many bars, restaurants and shops. Overall our experience was fantastic - I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The space was perfect for us--pleasant, well-appointed, plenty of linens, quiet. And the location could not be better, especially if you're attending a conference downtown. I'm through staying in hotels when I come to Austin for author/academic events--I'll be looking for an AirB&B of this caliber. Fantastic!"
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal were a pleasure to deal with during our trip to Austin. Great communicators, they provided us with clear instructions on how to self check in, were accommodating for our need to check in slightly earlier, and even left us a bottle of wine as a welcome present!

The flat is in a great area of town, and is in very good condition and is equipped with almost anything you'll need during your stay in Austin. My friends and I had a wonderful time in Austin, and I'd highly recommend this listing for anyone keen on visiting the city. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is great: very clean, well equipped, ideally located. The check-in and check-out were easy and the hosts were very understanding about early check in and late check out. My three friends and I had a great time in Austin. Dear Erik and Crystal, thank you so much!  "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect apartment for a weekend trip to Austin for 2 couples! The apartment is in a central location, walking distance to most things we wanted to do. Erik and Crystal were also extremely helpful hosts. They sent us a packet with recommendations before we got there and they were very accommodating every step of our visit. We accidentally left a kindle in the apartment and they were kind enough to ship it back to us - great service and very responsive.  Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,AWESOME!! The location of this loft could not be better and fit my six guests comfortably. Erik and Crystal responded immediately to any questions I had and checking in/out was extremely easy.  I would recommend this loft to anyone visiting Austin with friends. I am definitely planning to stay here when I come back! 
,,,,,,,,Amazing location! Exactly what I needed for a few days in Austin. You're literally in the heart of downtown. Erik and Crystal make it super easy to check in and checkout. And the condo had everything you would need for your stay. I will definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Great place, very convenient check-in and checkout."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location and a very nice, comfortable apartment for a stay downtown. Check-in and out was very easy and everything we needed was available to us during the stay, which made it much easier than staying in a hotel. Wifi was very slow as it is a communal network for the condos and being on the top floor doesn't help, but Erik has alerted the development manager so hopefully those staying in future won't even have that slight issue. Would definitely recommend and hope to return next year!"
,,,,,,,,Great spot and wonderful location.  Super easy experience with convenient communication. 
,,,,,,,,"Incredibly convenient location, charming, comfortable home, and perfectly stocked for our group of 4 -this was such a better experience than staying in a hotel for ACL!  

Erik and Crystal could not have been easier to work with, and the on-site parking was clutch!  Cute little Grocery around the corner, close to great restaurants and bars, and walkable to just about everything-we could not have been happier.  "
,,,,,,,,"Erick contacted me immediately after I booked the reservation and made a personal connection. Then they sent us a welcome packet a week in advance, and the place was just like they'd said. It's in a gated apartment complex (with a pool!) in the heart of Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Crystal and Erik's apartment is lovely, clean and in an ideal area to be able to walk about and see everything! Communication was fantastic, couldn't rate them highly enough! "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect stay at Erik & Crystal's loft! The best location, amazingly clean and convenient apartment, and great hosts. Thanks!!"

,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's loft is perfectly situated in the middle of downtown, within walking distances to tons of bars, restaurants, and attractions, and biking distance to everywhere else!  The loft was a perfect home base for our group of 4, we all fit comfortably into the space, and thoroughly enjoyed our first trip to Austin.  We had one issue of the water being turned off the first day we were there but Erik responded immediately and looked into the problem for us.  He was very communicative throughout our stay, and we would definitely stay at the loft again when we return to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The hosts â€“ Erik & Crystal were so responsive, helpful, and kind leading up to our trip. Most of our group had never been to Austin before, so they gave us lots of great recommendations (may which we tried, so we can vouch for them being good ones!). Any time we needed anything, they were just a text away. They were also wonderfully flexible with check-in / check-out times, which is great for out-of-town guests.

The place â€“ A lovely condo in an amazing location, just steps away from Rainy St, 6th St, etc. The pool was also a nice reprieve from the 100 degree temperature! Inside, the home was clean and comfortable, with everything we needed (including lots of AC!). A good fit for 1-2 couples or a small group.

Definitely recommend this spot / Erik & Crystal!
"
,,,,,,,,"The hosts did a great job of making us feel welcome by checking in with us, and making sure everything met our expectations. They also left us a bottle of wine! The place was clean and welcoming, and completely as described. The neighborhood was amazing and this place was in the heart of downtown Austin--exactly what we were looking for!"
,,,,,,,,"Very nice apartment, super easy and totally automated check-in/check-out process. Accommodating of early arrival/late check out. Great location!

Wi-fi was a little weak, and it wasn't completely clear that the 2nd bedroom was a loft with no door, but overall an awesome place!"
,,,,,,,,"Erik and  crystals downtown flat was absolutely perfect for our stay in Austin! The location was spot in, close to everything though still very quiet and away from the noise. The flat was very clean and set nicely for our stay. Erik and Crystal were very polite and made us feel welcome. We would definitely use them again on our next visit to the amazing Austin!! Thanks guys "
,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal were fantastic!  They were extremely responsive since the beginning of our booking up until we checked out.  They provided a great packet of information regarding checking in/out, things to do in the area and info about the condo.  The condo is set up great, it feels like a home.  They have all the essentials that you'll need to cook with and live there during your stay.  Accommodations were clean and tidy, on time and very central to all the things we wanted to do during our stay.  I would highly recommend staying here again.  The pool area was a great touch.  Not being from the area, it was a nice place to relax and cool down and it was never crowded.  Overall, they put together a lovely place that is functional, yet feels warm and homey.  Definitely better than staying in your typical hotel.  Thank you again, so much Erik & Crystal for such a lovely listing!!!  "
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay here again. It's always clean, quiet and well located. Thanks again Erik & Crystal."
,,,,,,,,"Loft apt was perfect. location was central to hotels, 6th street and the river, but quiet enough to enjoy peace. Well furnished and roomy and clean. Only wish that the condo provided internet was more up to speed. Would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Thank you Erik & Crystal we had a great weekend. Everything was very welcoming, well thought out and accommodating. We will give you guys a shout when we head back down to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Erik, did an amazing job communicating and helping me feel right at home. I loved his place and location, I would definitely recommend this to everyone who is looking to stay in austin.  

This place was right in the middle of everything and we walked almost everywhere we wanted to go."
,,,,,,,,"A group of 6 of us stayed at Erik and Crystal's place while in Austin for a weekend. The apartment is great, as advertised.  The location is perfect, close to all the bars and restaurants downtown and to Rainey Street.  Erik was easy to communicate with and very helpful.  Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal were wonderful hosts. While I did not get to meet them in person they made the check-in and check-out process extremely easy and were very helpful with recommendations of things to do around the area. 

The Loft itself is in a great location and is very easy to walk to from 6th St and the Congress Avenue Bridge. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to explore the best parts of Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Erik was extremely professional and prompt in responding. The space was exactly as advertised, and was in the perfect location. the instructions regarding everything were very clear, and the apartment was ready several hours before originally scheduled. Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place and great hosts. instructions very clear, the place was very clean and great location. "
,,,,,,,,Fantastic location.  Easy in and out.  Very well kept.  They did a great job
,,,,,,,,Great place for a weekend. Highly recommend :)
,,,,,,,,"It was a great stay! The location was perfect, and Erik gave us ample information about the unit and its surrounding areas. I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a cozy pad while exploring Austin."
,,,,,,,,"A group of four of us stayed in Erik and Crystal's loft for a weekend in Austin - such a great place, amazing location - convenient walking distance to anywhere we wanted to go - we absolutely loved it! Would 100% stay here again and highly recommend it. Erik and Crystal were also very accommodating and easily reachable which is a huge plus! "
,,,,,,,,Great apartment very close to the vibrant 6th street.
,,,,,,,,A group of 4 of us stayed in the loft for a couple of nights for our first time in Austin ! It was a great location and cute place! We were able to walk everywhere downtown! I would definitely recommend this place. The owners were very responsive too!
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's condo was exactly what we needed for a wedding weekend in Austin.  Extremely convenient location, room for everyone, and easy in and out with keyless entry.  Erik was super communicative when we had questions (which were few, as their welcome packet was really helpful and included lots of great tips).  The place was clean and well equipped for our weekend.  I'd recommend this to anyone needing to be centrally located in downtown Austin for the weekend, whether for work or pleasure!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Erik and Crystal's place during AFW Fest.  Their  home was exactly as pictured and described.  It was clean and comfortable.    The location was great, super convenient to many restaurants and bars.  I did a few morning runs by myself around the area and felt very safe.

Erik and Crystal were great about communicating with us before our arrival and throughout our stay.   The self check in/out process was super convenient as well.  We requested to extend our stay an additional night and our hosts promptly responded to and approved our request!  It was also nice to have the covered parking space in the garage which gave us piece of mind, not having to drive around to find parking, which can be quite challenging in downtown Austin.  They even communicated to us in advance when we had to move our vehicle due to work being done in the parking lot, and offered to reimburse us for any parking costs we incurred.

2 thumbs up for this loft and for the great hosts!  Will definitely stay again on a future trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"What a great place to stay in Austin!  The condo is easy to check into with coded entry.  The place is really  clean and comfy.  You can walk to a ton of bars and restaurants nearby.  When I come back to Austin, I'll try and book this place again. "
,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal were very accommodating answering any questions and providing a detailed check-in process along with their own free concierge of the immediate area of their condo. The location is perfect, situated centrally between 6th street and South Congress and in a comfortable part of town. The property itself was clean, fairly priced, and perfect for a weekend stay. If I make it back to Austin this would certainly be my basecamp again. My only challenge if there was one is the gate for the parking garage. The sensor did not seem to work on exiting so you had to shuttle keys to open. Thanks again guys!"
,,,,,,,,Superb location in downtown Austin. Very smooth experience. Erik & Crystal were extremely helpful arranging an early check-in and providing us with parking. Highly recommended. 
,,,,,,,,"What a great place to stay! The location was perfect for our trip, we traveled to Austin for a bachelorette weekend and spent most of our time out. The loft was clean, everything you might need in a kitchen for a short stay. We were worried about the bathroom situation with 6 girls getting ready but the second vanity was perfect and we all appreciated the numerous mirrors in the place. Super easy to take the airport flyer (only $1.75!), parking was a challenge for the girls who drove but there are several parking garages around that worked out. This is close to many great restaurants and bars and it's better we didn't stay much in the condo as the walls in the whole building are fairly thin.   Erik was available for any questions and the keyless entry was perfect.  Unfortunately, the weather didn't let us spend time at the pool. If I find myself in Austin again I would love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"We walked into the loft, and found a bottle of wine awaiting us on the table.  The place was perfect for our needs.  It was clean, nicely stocked( towels, pots and pans, cleaning supplies, trash bags), and close to many restaurants, as well as to the bus stops.  Being right downtown was wonderful.  The keyless entry worked very well.  When we rented a car, having the parking garage right in the building was a plus (particularly since there was no extra parking fee.)   Erik & Crystal were very easy to communicate with, not that we needed to do so often.  I would recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying here! The location is amazing, and the self check in/check out option makes everything so easy. Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,We stayed at Erik and Crystal's loft during SXSW 2015. The location was unbeatable and the loft itself was clean and comfy. We'd definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others as well! 
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's condo was a great place from which to explore Austin. It was clean and comfortable and very convenient to restaurants and clubs while being far enough from the bars that it was quiet. 

Erik was very responsive to our questions and the guide he and Crystal provided had great suggestions for things to do in the area. 

I would love to visit again some time. "
,,,,,,,,"Erik was a great host and great communicator throughout our entire experience.  We were able to utilize the self check-in and check-out process, and the key pad entry to the apartment made things very easy.  It was also great having a parking space in the complex.  We had more than one car, and as an FYI there is a garage right across the street for $5 (pretty cheap for the area!)  You can't beat the location, as it's walking distance to several downtown areas and Lady Bird Lake.  

The apartment fit the 4 of us comfortably (2 queen beds) and there's also a couch and room for an air mattress if you have more people.  

Keep in mind noise travels easily in the common areas of the apartment complex so you'll hear people outside and they'll probably hear you.  "
,,,,,,,,"The loft was a perfect location to get to anywhere in Austin - the east side and downtown.
Erik and Crystal were extremely welcoming as well as helpful during this trip. The condo is beautiful! Had a blast!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for our stay. Location couldn't be beat. It was two blocks from the center of all they action (bars, restaurants, etc). We took the $2 bus from the airport. The condo is great and as shown/described. Everything was clean and nice and we had everything we needed. Erik and Crystal were easy to communicate with and friendly and offered to help with anything we needed. I'd definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,The place was centrally located downtown which was close to all of the bars and restaurants. The check in and out process was super easy. This place had parking so it was easy to park my rental there without worrying about street parking. The place has two comfortable beds and had a washer and dryer. Erik was super helpful with all my pre-trip questions. Would stay again next time. 
,,,,,,,,"The hosts were very informative and answered my (many) questions before we arrived. The loft and all linens, etc. were clean and ready when we arrived. The loft is ideal for visiting Austin, TX. Walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. We were very pleased with our experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Eric and Crystal were spectacular hosts. Very accommodating, and very responsive from the moment we booked at their loft on 4th. The keypad made it SUPER easy for everyone (we were staying with another couple) for everyone to go in and out, and do their own thing. The location is perfect, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat! What a great place in Austin, and great hosts!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. The place was just as expected and the location is perfect. The hosts were very responsive as well.  We would definitely book it again.
,,,,,,,,"The experience I had with Erik and Crystal's Loft was great! They were very clear and prompt in their replies, the space was very clean and nice. They also went the extra step to provide local restaurants and bars. Perfect location for downtown Austin. I hope to come back!"
,,,,,,,,This was a great loft in downtown Austin.  Location was great with the lake a few blocks down and 6th St. and Rainey St. right nearby.  The owners were very helpful and welcoming.  They take care of the property and it does not go unnoticed.  Will definitely be staying here next trip to Austin.  I highly recommend staying at Erik and Crystal's property!
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful place! Great location- close to 6th st., bus routes, bike rentals, lots of bars and restaurants. Perfect amount of space for two couples. Erik was very helpful and quick to respond to questions. We would stay here again the next time we come to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome place and hosts! We can't wait to stay here again. It was super comfortable and in a great location. Thanks again! 
,,,,,,,,I have only great feedback for every aspect of this rental. Host was very polite and prompt in his communication. The place is in great condition. It's an older condo but has few fresh touches that make it nice. Location is great. It's an inner condo (no street view) but this is not an issue at all. I will certainly try to stay here when I am back in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a great F1 weekend here.  The place was clean, just as described, Erik was very communicative, and the location was perfect!"
,,,,,,,,Wow! Location was perfect and the condo was excellent. If you're coming to Austin definitely consider Erik and Crystal's place. Ps. there was a bottle of wine awaiting our arrival which was pretty awesome. 
,,,,,,,,I found the loft easily and ideally located in Austin. It's a nice spacious 2 bedrooms. I had no problem letting myself in despite a late arrival.
,,,,,,,,"Really cool loft in the middle of Austin. Easy access to different parts of town. Erik and Crystal were very helpful, have a beautiful home and make you feel welcome. "
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I recently returned from a wonderful weekend at the loft for the ACL festival. Erik and Crystal couldn't have been better hosts! They sent over a fantastic list of suggested spots to try before we arrived (a few of which we did-- they were winners!) and were available by phone in case we needed anything. The loft was spacious, clean, and in a wonderful location (easy walk to just about everything), and the bottle of wine they left for us at check in was such a thoughtful touch! If we are fortunate enough to return to Austin we would love to stay at the loft again-- highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's loft was pretty much perfect! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Austin. The location is right downtown, but on a quiet-ish road, walking distance to everything. The apartment itself has almost everything you will need, and Erik and Crystal are lovely and extremely accomodating. I only have great things to say about this place. Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time staying here! 
The condo is centrally located and easy to find. Parking is a bit tricky depending on the time that you arrive (you have to park on the street I order to get up into the condo to get the remote for entry into the parking lot). But after you get the remote, you're golden!
The place itself was very clean and nicely decorated. It felt like a home away from home. I love the spiral staircase as well! 
The shower works great and Erik and crystal even leave toiletries for your use. 
Great place! We will definitely be back again! 
Thanks again guys! 

"
,,,,,,,,Great stay; they had everything you might need at a perfect downtown location. Plus easy check in and awesome AC.
,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal's apartment was the perfect place for our stay in Austin. The location was an easy walk to anywhere and a block away from the convention center. The surrounding neighborhood was safe and offered many restaurants, shops, entertainment, yoga studios and more. The accommodations were very nice and beds especially comfortable. Having a fully equipped kit and washer/dryer was a bonus as well. The hosts were extremely easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any questions. Their check in and check out procedures were very easy and their guide extremely helpful. We highly recommend this loft and hope to be back again soon."
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal were incredibly responsive & helpful (even provided a great guide of their favorite Austin destinations). The loft itself was clean & welcoming and met all our expectations. The location is also within walking distance of some great bars and restaurants, as well as bus lines that go to other neighborhoods in Austin. We would definitely stay here again - was a great location for exploring Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's apartment was fantastic.  If I came back to Austin, I would definitely try and stay there again.  Everything went off without a hitch over our three night stay.  Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, could not have been any better for Austin day adventures and night life.  The condo was very clean and comfortable.  The best was the easy check in and check out (self administered with security key pads), Erik and Crystal very accomodating with needs/times.  The parking spot was very much appreciated and so very easy to use.  We highly recommend this place, very impressed.  Lots of towels and extra sheets/air beds which helped with our kids.  Best part for me was being across from Wunderlust Yoga (awesome drop in classes) and resturants (Crepe place run by French family and Berry Yogurt place around the corner, plus all the major dinner places at your door step).  Walk to bats on Congress, capitol, 6th street.  Looking forward to another visit here."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay.  Can't beat location and hosts were very helpful.  The condo was totally stocked and very clean.  My only words of caution would be that the upstairs loft does not allow the people staying up there to sleep in.  ANY and all noises from downstairs are heard.  So put your early risers up there.  It is also really warm in the loft.  A fan would make a huge difference.
,,,,,,,,"Our second time here, was as good as last time.
We felt welcome and the host was accommodating with our arrival and departure times.
We'll be back."
,,,,,,,,"Reasons I loved this airbnb:

1.The easiest self check in ever with the keypad entrance.
2.Host was super helpful with any questions, with exact cab fare info from airport or bus options.
3.Bottle of wine when you arrive! With a welcoming package with tons of information of things to do in Austin.
4.Location, Location, Locationâ€¦..walked everywhere, was super close to fun night life & restaurants. Highly recommend this location.

This was my first experience with airbnb & I was very pleasantry surprised, I picked this one from all the good reviews, and I have to say they were all RIGHT.

So thank you Erik & Crystal!!!
"
,,,,,,,,"Erik & Crystal were great. Super responsive before, during & after the rental. The loft was fantastic and centrally located. A couple of our favorite things about it:

1) Location
2) Plenty of linens & such.
3) Lots of basics. I.e. when you rent an apartment you don't want to have to buy a whole thing of cooking spray or salt. They had lots of the basics that you would need to cook (i.e. cooking spray, coffee, coffee filters, tea bags, sweeteners, salt & pepper and some other spices, etc etc). They also had a whole bunch of the hotel shampoos/conditioners/soaps etc (check the drawers in the bathroom).
4) Air conditioning worked well.
5) Ironing board, iron, hangers..etc. We were there for a wedding weekendâ€¦so all of these appliances made looking good possible :)
6) Flexible on check and check out time which was awesome since we had a late flight out. Also, we ended up coming a day early and since there was no one staying there, we were able to extend our stay!

Overall, would definitely stay there again if I returned to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We three loved the clean, comfortable loft of Erik and Crystal.  How nice it was to have a bottle of wine left by our hosts for us.  Location is perfect for exploring downtown Austin, easy walk to Ladybird Lake, capitol, dining, music. Loved having coffee provided too. The bus from the airport to the loft, $1.50!  Took bus out to the Broken Spoke for a super fun night of dancing the 2 step, dresses & cowboy boots YEE HA!  Thanks for your prompt and clear communication with us when we had a question.  A great place to stay."
,,,,,,,,"I have nothing but good things to say about our stay at Erik and Crystal's loft.  The location was ideal for a girls weekend of exploring the city and the accommodations were wonderful.  We had a group of 5 and fit comfortably into the space.  The loft was clean, comfortable, and exactly what we were looking for. Erik was extremely responsive to email (within minutes) and provided us a nicely organized sheet of information for check-in/ out, parking, restaurant recommendations, ect.  I would highly recommend this loft for your stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The 4th Street Loft was a great place to stay.  It is really central and accessible to everything, especially the Convention Center, which is why we chose it (four of us stayed there).  You could hear some noise at night, but you're pretty protected from it inside and it didn't wake us up.  The keyless entry and exit is a real plus, especially if you have several people staying there.  It avoids all that fuss about who has the key, etc.  The place is great--clean, attractive, and with a workable layout for several guests.  The master bedroom is spacious and has a desk for working and the couch folds out to accommodate up to two people.  There's a table in the living room that's great for both eating and working.  The loft has a huge bed and great space, though it can get a bit hot up there.  There is just one bathroom, if that matters to you, but we didn't find that inconvenient. The only downside was a somewhat iffy internet connection for the building, but with smart devices we mostly circumvented that.  I recommend this place!

As for the hosts, they are just terrific:  they send out a wonderful ""packet"" of information for the rental, complete with restaurants, coffee houses, and places to go (I tried several of their suggestions, happily).  They are also really easy and nice to deal with."
,,,,,,,,"The place was fantastic, very comfortable and clean, and the location was perfect.  Would highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"If your looking for a great apartment in a great location, this is the place. Apartment was perfect for us, it had everything we required. Easy check in, easy to get to and from the airport. Apartment was clean, with all the amenities to make the perfect home from home. Erik and Crystal even left us some beers and food, for our arrival. From the initial contact with the Erik and Crystal , to our departure, everything was spot on. 10 out of 10. "
,,,,,,,,"This is a comfortable, nicely decorated loft in a prime downtown location, walkable to many of Austin's great restaurants, music venues, and nightlife destinations.  We had a great time.  Erik and Crystal were very accessible hosts and made the check-in/check-out process super easy.  I endorse and recommend this beautiful spot. "
,,,,,,,,Erik and Crystal were amazing hosts. Communication was very quick and responsive. The loft was well stocked and ready for us. The location was perfect and I would stay here any time I'm back in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"The 4th St. Loft in Downtown Austin was the perfect vacation spot for our family.  The loft was located right in the heart of the city.  Erik and Crystal were the perfect hosts, they even left a bottle of wine for us to enjoy.  We will definitely stay at the loft again next time we are in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"It was fine. Clean, nicely furnished, and even a bottle of wine waiting for me,"
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal's apartment is in a great location for exploring the sights and sounds of Austin. Erik was easily contactable and the system in place to manage the check in and check out was extremely smooth. The apartment itself was clean, spacious enough for two couples and had great homely touches like washing powder, coffee and there was even a bottle of wine for us to enjoy when we arrived. Recommended property!"
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal were quite generous hosts! Completing the arrangements was simple and communication, a breeze. The condo is well stocked and included all the small detail items that make a trip enjoyable and hassle-free. It is clean, easy to get to and comfortable. We would surely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean and well appointed, with all of the amenities a working girl could want for a week long business trip - super speedy wifi, ample closet space and locally-roasted coffee just a block away. AND a hot yoga studio and juice bar across the street to balance out the late hours spent entertaining clients and at events. Erik was incredibly responsive and accommodating and provided excellent directions at check-in. Overall a great first airbnb experience!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was great, Eric and Crystal made everything very easy. They were very communicative and easy to contact.
Location was wondeful, amid all the downtown nightlife, close walk to the capitol building and all sorts of other exciting stuff! 
If you are looking for a place to stay for Fun Fun Fun Fest or any other Auditorium Shores Events, it is only a 10 min walk. Had a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,We just spent three great days in Austin on business. Our stay at Erik and Crystal's was nothing short of perfect. Their condo location is central to almost everything you would want to do in Austin. We walked everywhere. Erik has the check in and out process set up to be painless and convenient. The condo had everything we needed to be comfortable. Erik's suggestions about food and things to do were spot on.I will have to be back in Austin again for more work and will definitely contact Erik and Crystal to stay in their place.
,,,,,,,,"This was the PERFECT place for me and my 4 friends.  We stayed here during the first ACL weekend.  I still can't get over the location.  It is right in the center of it all.  And it just so happened that the ACL shuttle was only 4 blocks from the apt.  The house is clean, they have everything you could need!  There was even a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived, which was the perfect touch after a long day of travelling.  Would definitely stay there again WHEN I return to Austin :) "
,,,,,,,,"Great spot! Well stocked, spacious, and located close to the fun. It made our first Airbnb experience a great one. The sad part was having to leave. (Did manage to compare it to a few spots that friends were staying in Austin and we felt like we lucked out. Thanks!) "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Erik and Crystal's was great! Their condo was perfect for our needs-- clean, spacious and really close to 6th street! They even left us a welcome bottom of wine!

Erik and Crystal were very helpful and provided us a range of restaurant, bar, and activity suggestions.  They were extremely responsive and answered all of our questions. They were also very flexible and accommodated our schedule perfectly!

In short, it was the perfect first AirBNB experience!
"
,,,,,,,,Perfect location and nice home. Eric and Crystal were extremely helpful and reliable. Would recommend to anyone traveling to Austin. The pool in the complex was an added perk. 
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal have an adorable, perfectly placed apartment. I had SUCH a blast with my friends in Austin! 

Not only did we have everything we needed  - shampoo, soap, towels clean sheets, etc - they also left wine and coffee and an excellent guide to the city.

I highly suggest their apartment for your trip to Austin! Erik and Crystal are exemplary hosts."
,,,,,,,,"Great first experience with airbnb! I will definitely stay at Erik & Crystal's place any time I am visiting Austin in the future. The place was very nice and clean, with towels, beds made, coffee, shampoo/conditioner, and everything we could want for all of our guests. I had several questions and Erik would answer within minutes whenever I emailed him. On top of all that, the location is fantastic and the price is better than hotels in the area. I definitely recommend staying at their place if you're visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Stayed at Erik's place downtown Austin. Great location, place was very clean and accommodating. All my group was impressed. Thanks Erik!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful trip and every part of the experience staying with Erik and Crystal!

We checked in alone but were immediately made to feel welcome with a note and some Shiner. The apartment was very clean and well presented with everything we could possibly need.

Erik was very easy to deal with and the communication was excellent. We will definitely be visiting again next time in Austin. First class experience!"
,,,,,,,,"This loft was very clean and pleasant, and most of all was quiet during our entire 5 night stay. When we return to Austin I reckon we would gladly stay here again. It has 1 br, kitchen, bath & dining room downstairs, and a spacious double bed loft upstairs. The air con worked well the entire time. There are a few flights of stairs up to the apartment but this was no issue for us. Cheers."
,,,,,,,,"If you're considering a stay in downtown Austin STOP, don't look anywhere else!  Erik and Crystal are great hosts!  When his 1yr old AC unit unexpectedly broke down Erik managed the repairs from his vacation in Germany!  You can't ask for better service!  

My wife and I stayed in the loft during my one month internship in Austin with three boys (7, 4, and 1.5 yrs old).  The loft was spacious enought for our one month stay and the pool provided a great way to wear the kids out for bed-time.  Overall our time in Austin was wonderful due in large part to our stay here and the hospitality shown to us by Erik and Crystal."
,,,,,,,,I decided to stay at Erik's condo because it was for my friend's birthday and close to 6th st. I had a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to be close to everything Austin has to offer. Erik was always available whenever I had a question and the condo was more than I expected.
,,,,,,,,My family had a great time staying at this lovely loft.  The location is great for accessing downtown Austin.  The apartment had everything we needed and was comfortable after a day of roaming around.  
,,,,,,,,"We had a great long weekend at Erik's condo!  To start with, Erik is a great communicator and send us very detailed directions for getting the key (we didn't meet).  The condo is central to everything and one block away from the airport shuttle which made our weekend very convenient.  The condo was nice and clean.  I would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Erik's place downtown was wonderfully located to many wonderful restaurants and bars.  It is fairly easy to navigate by car, as long as you can figure Austin's streets.  Having parking was great!  They also had many perks that were really nice and convenient.  I look forward to staying again!"
,,,,,,,,"A great apartment in a perfect location! I stayed with a colleague while attending a convention, and I couldn't have asked for a more convenient spot. Though we didn't meet in person, the owners were very gracious and attentive hosts. "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great central location to stay in Austin. Walking distance to good food, the convention center, and many convention hotels. Very quiet for being right in the middle of the city. All the conveniences of an apartment with a big kitchen. Erik makes it easy to check in and out with a key lock system, so we never got to meet him - but he checked with us by text to make sure all was well. Be ready to climb some stairs - it is good for you! "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location for downtown access.  Accommodations were basic, but comfortable and clean.  The main room was a bit tight for four people, but it worked, Hosts were very responsive overall.  BUT - The only way to lock the door from either the inside or out was with a key.  DANGEROUS in emergencies, and inconvenient at best since there weren't enough keys for each of our party to have one.  A bat got in through the loft vent on the 2nd night there, and all hell broke loose.  Owner is a good person and will probably fix the lock issue, but I'd make sure before I committed to staying there."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, well-decorated space, and very friendly, helpful hosts! "
,,,,,,,,"Erik was great!

He provided me with all the necessary information and for a first time user of AirBnB it was such an easy and hassle free process!

The house itself was amazing! perfect location and was really funky! 

We could have not have asked for anything else!

Rosh"
,,,,,,,,"Great place, perfect location and superb hosts! Definite thumbs up for this one. We had a great stay, and would like to come back in the future. 

"
,,,,,,,,"Erik's place was just wonderful - a great location in the heart of Austin, with ample room for everyone in our party. The loft itself was charming, clean, and just as described in the profile. Erik was a great host - and while we weren't able to meet him in person due to unusual check in/check out times, he was very prompt in communicating, gave us great info about Austin,  and responded quickly to our requests. We would gladly stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Stayed at Erik's place for over a week and it was perfect! It was just steps away from the convention center which made it the ideal location for us. Checking in and out was a breeze and Erik was easy to reach and friendly.  Thanks so much!
,,,,,,,,"Erik was such a great host and his place was amazing. The loft was right next to a lot of amazing restaurants and bars and is easily walkable to visit the State Capitol or UT. I must have e-mailed him back and forth 20 times and he was always cordial and timely in his responses. Definitely staying here again for our next trip to Austin. 

"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great week in Austin.  The apartment was lovely and very comfortable with great supplies etc.  I was working there and it was just minutes from the convention centre.  Had some time to explore too and the location was great for bars, restaurants, shops and sight-seeing.  Erik was very helpful and quick to respond.  Couldn't have asked for more from our stay."
,,,,,,,,"We had 2 young kids  (1 &4 yrs) staying at Erik's place. The total is 4 people!. The older girl stay upstairs... she loves the spiral staircase. The youngest, stayed with us in a crib downstairs. Erik was very accommodating by removing as much baby dangerous items as possible. Although it was not completely baby safe, it was a fair accommodation. To prevent the youngest from climbing the spiral staircase, we made a gate using a cardboard sheet, strings, and a clip to attached to the stairs rail. It worked. The location was awesome! I selected the location because it was walking distant to my husband's work. And also it was significantly cheaper than staying at a corporate housing that the company was offering. [We had a relocation allowance, if we go over we pay out of pocket]. I would recommend this place to visitors, families, and relocated people."
,,,,,,,,"Erik's condo is in a fantastic location downtown Austin.

For tourists, you're close to a variety of TexMex and fine dining options, & plenty of bars (without being too close).  

For business visitors, it's 2 blocks from the convention center, without any of the hotel nonsense.  Can't beat it.

Other notes:
â€¢ The condo is smashingly close to the lake trail, perfect for runs.  
â€¢ The WiFi is rather slow, be prepared."
,,,,,,,,"We rented for a whole week, it was excellent. The location is very central, the apartment was clean and well equipped and Erik was very helpful and responsive. We hope to stay there again. The only caution I would have is for people with disabilities, there are two flights of stairs to get to the front door, and a steep spiral staircase to get to the second bedroom loft area. This was fine for us, but something to consider."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at this loft. The location can't be beat and the space was clean and cozy and fit six of us very comfortably. Erik and Crystal provided everything we could need. It's a couple of blocks from 6th street and pretty convenient to everything! Around the corner is Fogo's and Max's, and it's a few blocks from the capitol! Awesome place to stay! We'll definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was great!  The loft is spacious, clean and modern. And the location cannot be beat! One block from the Airport Bus ($1!), 2 blocks from Congress, 2 blocks from 6th Street - just a great base for our Austin adventures. Erik went above and beyond with communication when we booked, and gave us all the information we needed to have a wonderful stay.  "
,,,,,,,,See our other review - the place was so great we booked it twice!! =)  
,,,,,,,,Erik and his loft were great.  His provided area guide was useful and the check-in instructions were clear.  The location was ideal for our six member group attending a comic con at the convention center two blocks away.  The level of accommodation went well beyond our expectations.  Everything was very clean and the neighbors were friendly.  This was my first use of airbnb and hope all my future experiences are as pleasant.
,,,,,,,,"Didn't know what to expect, first time using airbnb. Place was great. Incredibly clean, with anything and everything you would ever need. Erik was in touch with any questions I had, and replied to emails within minutes. I highly recommend for any Austin getaway. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great week staying at Erik and Crystal's during ACL! The location was perfect--in the heart of downtown and within walking distance to a lot of  excellent bars, restaurants, and clubs. 

The loft is attractive, spacious, and clean. Even though only two of us stayed in the loft, it can easily fit more. Having a fully stocked kitchen (appliances, plates, etc.) and a washer/dryer was so convenient, as was the free internet.  

I felt safe staying at, coming to and leaving from the complex--it is completely secure. It also has a very nice swimming pool and an available parking space.  

Erik couldn't have been more gracious; he gave us tips on places to go and fun things to do. He worked with our travel schedules, and made sure we had the right information far in advance so our trip went smoothly. He was also 100% available if we had questions and/or needed anything.

It was a great time, and I am so glad we stayed at their loft! Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,The loft was great!  A nice space that was plenty for 3 people. I'm not sure the location could be any better.  We walked to everywhere we needed to be with a majority of those walks being 5 minutes or less.  I will definitely consider the loft again on my next trip to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect place for us to stay as a group of five. The parking was convenient and even though the weather was a little too cool and rainy to use it during our stay, the shared pool was lovely. We really appreciated all of the little details the host considered. We would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Erik was a fantastic host, provided plenty of information about the area and made himself available for questions.  The apartment itself is lovely and the location couldn't be better.  It's near 6th St (but not noisy), close to the convention center and public transportation.  I highly recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Erik's loft while attending a conference at the convention center and couldn't have been happier.  The loft, itself, was fantastic ... it was exactly like the photos show it to be.  Plus, you can't beat the location: a block and a half away from the convention center; 2 blocks away from all the bars and restaurants on 6th Street; about 2 blocks away from the river and a great walking/running trail.

This loft will be my top choice to stay each time I return to Austin.  Thanks Erik!"
,,,,,,,,This place was great! It was so close to everything and was big and spacious. We had a great time and Erik was only too willing to help with anything we needed. Thanks Erik. 
,,,,,,,,"Erik and Crystal were amazing hostesses and such kind people. I held my sister bachelorette party here and it was the perfect setting. There was plenty of room for all 8 girls and all our stuff. The condo was in perfect condition and very clean. Extra pillows, sheets, blow up mattresses, and towels were available as well as anything you might need in the kitchen. Erik and Crystal's condo is perfect distance from all the downtown sites, eats, and bars you can think of. I would stay here again, no question about it.  "
,,,,,,,,This is a super location and a great building.  The facilities made us feel right at home.  We could walk almost everywhere.  Close enough to all the fun and craziness of 6th street while being far enough away to not hear it.  Two adults and two kids were a bit snug but it worked for us.  
,,,,,,,,"Erik's loft is sweeping, modern, and comfortable. The photographs on the site are great, but they don't do the place justice: its sweeping details, granite countertops, and colorful accents are truly extraordinary. Five people can stay here comfortably. 

Not only is the space fantastic, but the location can't be beat. Two of my favorite culinary discoveries of Austin - Taco Shack and Max's Wine Dive - are literally across the street from the apartment. 

Erik is also a fantastic host. He provided us with a list of all of his favorite downtown haunts, and he was very accommodating when our flights were delayed and we had to adjust our check-in times. 

I would definitely stay in this loft again!"
16225537,,10,10,10,10,10,10,The host was amazing. She always answered any questions or concerns. Place is great! Very nice for couples or group of friends to stay. Everything was provided. 
4183299,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Had a great stay. The house is in a great location, walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, movie theatre etc.

,,,,,,,,"We just returned home from an amazing ACL experience, made even better by our choice to stay in Kenneth's fantastic home. Location, location, location -- not only were we within comfortable walking distance to Zilker Park, but also close to a ton of amenities (food + Starbucks!) basically out the back door on Lamar. The house was immaculately clean, comfortable (for a party of 4), and met all of our wants and needs. We hope to return to Austin and, when we do, wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Thanks again for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"I would highly recommend this place for anybody that wants to visit Austin. It's the perfect place to mellow out, enjoy the sun, cool off in the pool, or just sit on the patio while it rains (my personal fav). 
The place was so easy to get to from the airport and was right next to a ton of stuff, including the MY favorite theater in the world; The Alamo Drafthouse. Gonna try and stay here every time I come back to Austin..."
,,,,,,,,"This place is fantastic! The location is great and the house is perfect for lounging with friends. We had 3 people staying over a weekend and it was more than accommodating (I can attest, the couch is incredibly comfortable). I didn't get to meet Kenneth in person but he was an excellent host. He was quick to respond to any questions I had and provided us with a super helpful list of what to do in the area. Highly recommended for visitors and locals alike!"
,,,,,,,,"Kenneth was fantastic, quick to answer questions and very friendly! A few days before we arrived we received the welcome packet that had a list of recommendations. We arrived to a very clean and charmingly Austin styled place.  The bottle of champagne welcoming us helped set the trip off in the right direction! A group of us stayed here for ACL. It was perfect walking distance to the park, along with nearby restaurants and bars. You can very easily Uber it to 6th Street as well if that interests you, along with S. Congress. "
,,,,,,,,Beautiful home and great location! Kenneth's house was clean and upon arrival and greater us with a bottle of champagne. Could not have asked for a better experience. 
,,,,,,,,"Kenneth is a fantastic host, super helpful, friendly, really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and the whole process easy. The place is lovely as well - charming, beautiful and clean. I would definitely stay there again when in Austin. "
13802639,5,10,9,10,10,10,10,"There were some items missing in the kitchen but as soon as we informed Dominique, she sent them immediately. This however was uncomfortable because she didn't ask us when would be okay, and showed up unannounced. The wifi was VERY poor (no connection at times and only works if you are sitting on the couch). When told about this she came over again, unannounced, tried to fix it and told us that because all the surrounding rentals were booked it was going to be poor. The matresses and pillows were incredibly soft ie. not comfortable, the pillows felt like enlarged airplane pillows. Mattresses so soft that my father slept on the living room floor 3/4 nights, and 3/4 had very poor nights of sleep. We did mention this to Dominique who told us she would be willing to switch the matresses for firmer ones, however this was on New Years in the middle of the day so we declined, especially after having two unannounced visits we preferred no more interruptions on our family time. If you choose to stay here and want to get a good nights rest I would suggest asking for them to give you firmer matresses ahead of time. 

It was also incredibly loud in the bedrooms at night. One of the bedrooms did not have blinds and the lights from the surrounding buildings came right in. You can hear all of the noise from the street. I would recommend that the hosts put double-pane windows at least in the two first buildings and much darer shades in both of the rooms. For people who want to stay, if you have the option ask for one of the rentals that is furthest away from the road. 

The location of the house is great. The house is average, very much like your typical townhouse, the dining room table is slightly strange and they have art for sale on the walls. 

This is definitely a situational case but a very uncomfortable one. Because my daughter has a service animal we were made to fill out an eight page almost-like a lease agreement, very uncomfortable, never experienced this before, also, because of the service dog we were pre-charged $100 additional.

Overall this could have gone a lot smoother, specially with the dog situation + contract, as well as communicating when you are coming by. It felt like a 5 day Austin rental much more than an AirBnB experience. "
,,,,,,,,Great place and very central
,,,,,,,,"We travelled to Austin to attend a beat-the-crowds early Thanksgiving gathering, and found Dominique's townhouse a fine place to stay:  Very conveniently located for car access to everywhere, impeccably clean, with all-cotton sheets and white towels, and lots of suggestions for nearby things to do and places to eat.  The unit we rented was not the same as the one pictured  (apparently Dominique owns several units in the same private complex - good to know for even bigger family gatherings or a weddings).  But it was identical except for furniture details, so no complaints there.  Advance details, check-in, home instructions and communications with Dominique all worked perfectly(URL HIDDEN)If you look at a map, you'll see the address is on a busy arterial street - that's what makes it so convenient - but the complex is set far back up a steep drive, so it is indeed as quiet and private as promised.  We went for a wander through the Bouldin Creek residential neighborhood in the quiet streets behind, and really enjoyed the glimpse of well-tended old mixed with eclectic new that makes Austin so interesting.  "
,,,,,,,,"The space worked out great for our team! It was really convenient to get up to downtown, over to South Congress, and more. Dominique was super helpful in answering questions we had!"
,,,,,,,,"Dominique was a wonderful host. She was very accommodating and responsive. The townhouse is in a great location and accessible to downtown, Rainey St, SoCo, food trucks & Zilker park. "
,,,,,,,,Well appointed and spacious - our stay was perfect. Very easy walk to Zilker Park for ACL!
,,,,,,,,Nice place! We loved being walking distance to south congress and the waterfront! Would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay during our long weekend in Austin. The location is perfect, close to restaurants and food trucks, music, nightlife, and stores on South Congress, South First, Rainey Street and 6th Street. A short walk to the Colorado River and its riverside parks and trails. And it's just a 5-minute drive to the Barton Creek trails and paddle board/kayak rentals. We were able to experience all of those things.

Everything was there as described and promised when we arrived, it was very comfortable for our family of five (all adults). We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Dominique!"
9500935,,10,10,10,10,8,8,"Stacie was very welcoming and gave a wonderful introduction to her healthy food efforts (which I appreciate as a physician).  The loft is nice.  10 min walk to SXSW Austin Convention Center.  Being used to hotels, the check in and check out logistics can be improved to more scalable over time - right now, it's a pretty manual process for Stacie (which I think is tough on her - she was quite flexible given my delayed flight).  Tough allergies for me because of the outside pollens. "
3739912,5,10,10,9,10,10,9,"Kerin's place was fantastic! Big, clean, and only steps away from the action on 6th St. She was a lovely host who gave clear directions and was reachable throughout my stay for any troubles. I highly recommend her loft for any travelers to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Kerin's apartment is incredible! Impeccably decorated and the location is perfect. Would never stay at a hotel in Austin without first checking to see if Kerin's place is available.
,,,,,,,,"Kerin's condo was right in the middle of everything! The condo itself was clean, organized, and smelled wonderful. The location is perfect and we were able to explore downtown Austin on foot. 6th street is just blocks away where they have live music on the weekends! "
,,,,,,,,"Kerin is very responsive and helpful with anything I needed on the trip. Great location, awesome views, and would highly recommend it.  "
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay! Kerin's condo is beautiful and in an excellent location, we walked all over downtown. Loved checking out city!"
,,,,,,,,"Kerin has a great place, we really enjoyed our stay. She's super thoughtful in her approach to hosting â€“ she sent all the details ahead of time, responded to questions quickly and left clear instructions (and some goodies) in her condo for us. In terms of the space itself, it's very comfy and cool. I can't imagine the location being much better either, it was super central to all the best activities in town. We would definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience! Her beautiful decoration made us feel right at home and the location could not be beat! We will use her again the next time we are in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Amazing views and an Amazing Stay. Kerin was very attentive to the things guests need. She was very accommodating and flexible with. I would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"The condo was beautifully decorated, well laid out and had a great kitchen area, nice views of downtown Austin and of the nightlife in Austin.  The condo was clean, smelled fantastic, in fact, every time we walked in I commented to my husband on how great it smelled.  Kerin was extremely helpful in arranging keys, parking and welcomed us with a nice bottle of Cabernet.  This place is convenient to downtown Austin, is just a block from 6th Street, practically next door to the Convention Center, no not too far from South Congress and from Rainey St.  Our favorite place was Easy Tiger which is just around the corner.  Kerin also made leaving easy and leisurely.  This was our first visit to Austin and this luxury apartment just added to our great experience.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,"Kerin's place was great. Exactly as advertised--centrally located, the pictures are accurate, etc. Kerin was super cool when I got there, gave me the keys and showed me around. Everything was nice and easy. Highly recommended. "
9731339,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"The place was amazing! Close to everything, great place to stay! "
,,,,,,,,"Camille and Ames are very organized, and the information they provided as an introduction to their property was very helpful.

PROS
Check in was very streamlined and easy, and we enjoyed our stay overall. The property is very nice, and the neighborhood is very cute if you like lots of trees and quaint houses. It definitely felt like we lived in a cute neighborhood, and that's a big part of the charm of this spot. We were only two there, but the extra beds would probably make this a good bargain for a family with one or two kids. The TV is also very big.

CONS
Overall, I'd say the place is nice, but we didn't feel like any special touches were put into making our experience exceptional. Not a big deal at all, but sometimes special touches are nice. The pictures make the space appear a bit brighter than it is in reality, and if I were rating and the bed and pillows, I'd give them a 3.5 out of 5, but I realize that could be subjective. Also, for downtime, it would have been nice to have more DVDs to choose from.

OVERALL
This place is very conveniently located if you want to be close to the action of Austin but still experience a quaint neighborhood. Our experience overall was good, so I'd recommend this to friends.

"
,,,,,,,,Good location next to nice restaurants. The hosts are great communicators. Would visit again!
,,,,,,,,"I loved the location of Ames's place. It was only about 10-15 (by car) away from everywhere in Austin that we wanted to visit. It was in a nice, quiet, residential neighborhood which was nice. Wi-Fi was great. The place is very spacious. Check-in was easy. I loved the privacy of the place as well. I didn't personally meet Ames or Camille, but I talked to Camille on the phone about a minor power issue we had and she was extremely nice and helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"The studio was a great fit for our group. Located in a quiet & safe neighborhood but also within walking distance to restaurants, shopping, grocery, and bars. The hosts were very accommodating and provided suggestions on where to eat and what to visit. They were also very responsive to any questions we had.  "
,,,,,,,,"Nothing particularly wrong with this place: it looks nice, very well positioned in the city and quite like the open space structure. The cons are the dust, hairs around and underneath the bed..and worn furniture (bed, old windows, bathroom, kitchen appliances). In short words looks nice but when you look closer...just fine for the price."
,,,,,,,,"Super ideal location, lots if light, comfortable and just plain lovely"
,,,,,,,,Camille was fantastic and very accommodating.  Thank you
,,,,,,,,"Looks just like it does in the pictures. 

Description of everything is spot on. 

Location is a short shared ride to just about anywhere in the city 6th and Rainey Streets included. 

Would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Ames & Camille sent me a very detail email and instructions for my stay! They were super helpful and clear with their instructions on finding the place. they also left great recommendation of places around the home we could visit. Overall great! Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at Ames' place. We stayed at his apartment with three adults and one 5 year old child and we all enjoyed our stay. Everything was prepared, clean and super comfortable. The neighborhood is in walking distance to nice coffee and shopping places. We would definitely recommend to stay at Ames' place. Just make sure to bring some mosquito repellent if you want to stay in the nice backyard at after sunset. : )"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great time at this AirBNB! Camille is super responsive - she even ordered us an extra extension cord and hangers bc we mentioned we needing a few extra. She gave me a ton of yoga suggestions nearby when I asked too  :) She's definitely a happy-to-help local. The place is spacious, super clean and comes with a fully equipped kitchen too! Less than a 10 min drive to the downtown area so it was convenient for us as we were in town for a film festival happening in that area. "
,,,,,,,,"An overall great apartment in a beautiful neighborhood. Loved the space and the garden. The neighborhood is mainly residential but it's a short walk or bike ride to downtown. Camille was great, responded immediately and the handbook is very thorough with instructions for everything. Will definitely consider coming back!"
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. The only negative is we were about a 10-15 minute drive to downtown and it was difficult getting taxis with no Uber in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"This home was absolutely lovely. We loved staying in a nice neighborhood but still able to walk downtown. Communication was quick and easy, can't wait to come back! "
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was nice and quiet, welcoming, and the instructions for accessing everything were relatively straight forward. The A/C unit was confusing on how to get it to work and knowing how to work the A/C is vital in Texas. Those instructions could have been a bit clearer."
,,,,,,,,"The combination of location, spaciousness, price, and kitchen amenities led us to pick this spot for a weekend in Austin. And did not disappoint! In addition to these factors, the hosts had the best ""Home Manual"" (in print and emailed PDF) of any AirBnb I've ever stayed. Ames' communication and suggestions for specific food requests that I had helped us feel well taken care of. There were also plenty of towels, bath robes, etc. that can sometimes feel sparse at rentals. Overall we were very appreciative of the experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Ames and Camille were very responsive and quick to welcome us to their studio. The studio is on a quiet alley in a beautiful neighborhood. We were primarily out and taking in the city of Austin, but enjoyed a peaceful place to come back to and rest for the next day."
,,,,,,,,"Listing description was very accurate and I enjoyed my stay here! Comfy bed and chairs and central location to lots of good restaurants/shops. I was able to book same day and everything was ready before I arrived.  Very easy to reach when I had a question and very clear information/guide provided as well.
Thank you for everything!"
,,,,,,,,I absolutely loved my stay here. It was so close to where we wanted to spend our time during the day. The host was so wonderful to us and answered any questions we had promptly. I would absolutely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"The host was very welcoming, and the neighborhood was super relaxing and close to the majority or places one would want to visit in austin. Great location! If you are planning on spending much time in the house with multiple people I would try to find something a little bigger but great for those of us that just used it to relax, sleep and get ready! "
,,,,,,,,Place was great! Easy directions and great location to stay!
,,,,,,,,We really loved staying at Ames & Camille's spot in Austin! It was in an awesome location and was super clean and spacious with lots of room for people to sleep. It was a huge plus having laundry downstairs for us to use since my friends and I were on a roadtrip and running out of outfits! The welcome binder was also super helpful with recommendations. We chose our lunch and dinner spots from there as well as Barton Springs to go to during the day. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Austin ! 
,,,,,,,,"Leading up to our stay the hosts were very responsive.
Upon arriving at almost midnight after an extremely long flight, which the hosts had been made aware of, I was shocked that no outdoor light had been left on as the accommodation is located above the garage, accessed by a rear laneway. Getting luggage up a flight of stairs and locating the lock box etc would have been made a lot easier. Upon entering we were hit with stifling heat as no cooling had been left on for us...during summer in Texas. The last thing we wanted after for traveling for more than 24 hours was to sit up for several more hours as we waited for the place to cool down. 
As the hosts live on the property if for some reason they couldnt pop in and put on the aircon and the light perhaps they could have at least put some cold water in the fridge.
The hosts never introduced themselves or msgd to see how things were. We didnt introduce ourselves as the guide book listed at least  twice the importance of respecting their privacy. 
 The guidebook hasnt been updated in some time as it only listed Uber and Lyft as the rideshare options, however these have to been present in months. I was aware of this but some guests may not be and it wold be a time save to list actual operating options. The tv isnt connected to an antenna but does have a chrome cast attached, some info in the guide book regarding this could be useful for some guests. 
The location is great. 
Its the little touches and extra though that I like about Air BnB, sadly missing here. The bed was so soft that if two people are lying on it you find yourself in an uncomfortable ditch like situation.  The bed was dressed with a bare old doona wrapped between a sheet and a woolen blanket (in (URL HIDDEN) Texas). Doesnt seem like theres been much true consideration for the guests comfort here. 
At this price I would have preferred to stay at a motel. 
"
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at the home of Camille and Ames. The house is very clean and confortable. The localization is very good, a little minutes of downtown. The place is very charming with a public pool very close, which it was great on a sunday of 104ÂºF.
The place is very quiet and was possible rest all the nights, and always that needed contact, the answers were very fast.
Camile and Ames, thank you so much for giving us these days in your home!"
,,,,,,,,"The neighbourhood was gorgeous & Ames left s a lot of useful tips & local knowledge which came in really handy! I would recommend downloading a ride-share app before your stay (Ames also recommended) as the walk to 6th street can be long in 100Â° heat but pleasant in cooler weather. 
The styling of the home was gorgeous & you can see they have a keen interest in the finer things. 
Would love to stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"I'm a former Austinite who relocated to the West Coast.  I missed my friends, breakfast tacos, and Hippie Hollow, so I convinced my partner to fly down and explore the city with me.  We didn't spend a great deal of time at the airbnb, but our time there was enjoyable overall.  Ames and Camille were friendly and very responsive to communication. The place is simply decorated but cute, and you can't really beat Clarksville location-wise; easy access to pretty much everything you could want to do in Central Austin as well as Mopac if you need to get around.  Pretty sweet.

My only gripe is that we stayed in mid-July and it was over 100 degrees... and the air conditioner just couldn't keep up with the heat outside.  It was miserably hot from late afternoon until 10pm-12am every night, especially in the nook where the bed is, which made it difficult to sleep.  Kind of a bummer- I'm super sensitive to the heat, but even my partner, who's from the tropics and loves the heat, was having a hard time getting used to it.

In short, I'd definitely stay here again... but probably not during the summer. "
,,,,,,,,"Super airbnb place!  Very quiet, convenient, well appointed, amazing location, stylish decor.  Hard to imagine a better place when in Austin.  Great value.  Had a couple of minor issues that Camille resolved within hours, she was very attentive to our needs and a great communicator."
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful time staying in this appt! The location was perfect and the appt had everything we needed. We took advantage of the book of recommendations and had the most amazing trip in Austin thanks to Ames and Camille! Couldn't recommend this place enough.
,,,,,,,,"Camille and Ames were very kind and communicative from the start. They were very accommodating and hospitable with their house guides. The location is great - I really felt like a local. Very close to a lot of fun places, but nicely tucked away and quiet. 

Thank you for a great stay in Austin, Camille and Ames! You helped make our visit so comfortable and fun! Can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,,,,"Place was perfect for us, it was a short walk to down town, apartment was clean and comfortable and Camille gave clear instructions for checking in and out"
,,,,,,,,Great! 
,,,,,,,,"Listing was exactly as pictured, comfortable setting, easy to get in with directions, very communicative. Good spot in Austin hidden away but with some options to walk close, quick ride to downtown, easy access to the main highway. 

Was a little warm when I got to the unit, AC was off, but it cooled down eventually. 

Overall a good experience. Very clean, most important part for me. I would stay again. 

"
,,,,,,,,Ames and Camille made my stay in Austin a breeze. The instructions provided before my arrival made it quick and easy to find the apartment and get settled in. I appreciated how the check-in/check-out process was so streamlined. The space was just as described - very comfortable and conveniently located within walking distance of good food and entertainment. I would definitely recommend staying here.
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I were traveling to Atx to celebrate the end of our first year as teachers. Ames and Camille were very helpful with providing information about the BNB and answering any questions we had. Their feedback was quick and their place was charming! I wanted my friends to get a feel of the Atx lifestyle and we found it at Ames' listing. The neighborhood was quiet, safe and close to everything we wanted to do downtown. Parking was also wonderful! There was plenty of space inside the loft and it came well equipped with all of the essentials you would expect to find in a hotel. Check-in was also a breeze! We were coming in late and instead of rushing to meet them in Atx at a pre-determined time they had the keys ready for us to pick up once we finally arrived. I've stayed in several AirBNBs (Hungary, London, Nashville) and this was cozy, relaxing, affordable and accessible. I'd highly recommend this space to anyone wanting a local experience in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,The place was well supplied and easy to find. I will definitely stay here in the future. 
,,,,,,,,Communication was great throughout the process and the space itself was perfect - it's bigger than it looks! The neighborhood is in a great location which lends itself to exploring central Austin. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"My adult daughter and I loved this place! It was a comfortable haven from the heat. The bed was like a cloud, the shower was perfect, super clean, big TV(we streamed in shows thru (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Chrome) and very quiet!
Great place if you love to walk downtown- it's about a 5-min walk. You can rent city bikes close by and never really need a car!
I loved this house and would DEFINATELY return! "
,,,,,,,,"A hidden gem! The neighborhood is fantastic, close to downtown, and the apartment is spacious and safe. I recommend and hope to be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Ames place was excellent! We had such a great time and the location is AMAZING! Super walkable to almost anywhere you would want to go, RECOMMEND!"
,,,,,,,,"Very comfortable, great location"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great weekend stay here.  It was a great neighborhood and very central.  Getting in and out was simple and communicating with the hosts was easy.
I loved that there was coffee and a couple snacks left for us as well as access to a washer and dryer if we needed.
The shower was nice and hot with great pressure.
All in all it exceeded expectations and we hope to return!"
,,,,,,,,"Stayed in the huge backhouse! Easy to understand how to get there, and good location for walking - about 30min walk to downtown. Very clean, and looks exactly as pictured. 

Would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Hidden away like a secret in historic Clarksville, this is a special gem in Austin. Just a few blocks yo the east awaits the busy vibe of town, but a couple of blocks to the west sits the Clarksville neighborhood center, with old bistro and bar standbys Jeffrey's and Cippolina. Anchoring an immaculate garden, the apartment is airy and filled with light. A perfect stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Ames and Camille left very clear instructions on how to access the house, the place is great, very clean and in a great location."
,,,,,,,,A perfect space in a great part of Ausitn.  Host was a great communicator and everything was as advertised.  It was our first time in Austin and the place helped make it a great trip.
,,,,,,,,We had a great time in Austin and the studio was a great base whilst we were there. The apartment has everything you could need and more and Camille and Ames are very open and generous with sharing their home. Would definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,"An awesome spot for a trip to Austin! A super charming neighborhood -- safe and quiet for a good night's sleep, and close to good food and drink. Check-in and out details were communicated seamlessly, and I appreciated the great recommendations for nearby attractions. "
,,,,,,,,Great experience. Thanks so much! 
,,,,,,,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Excellent location, great value, and a comfortable setting. "
,,,,,,,,"I had the best time in Austin, and the apartment was perfect for my stay. It's exactly as described.  I was travelling alone and felt extremely safe and secure at the apartment. The area, Clarksville, is very safe as well. The apartment is situated very close to the lake and to whole foods as well as other grocery stores and restaurants within a few minutes walk.  The hosts, Camille and Ames, were brilliant. They responded to every message really quickly from before I booked up to my very last day.  The Internet at the apartment is super quick and that's very useful to have.  I used the garden as well so it was really great to be able to have breakfast out there, and catch some sun.  I'm already planning my return and will definitely get back in touch with Camille and Ames to book their lovely apartment for my next stay! "
,,,,,,,,"I was in Austin helping a friend move and found their Bnb to be perfect for what I was looking for. Parking was so easy, their instructions to get inside couldn't have been explained better. The place is bigger than I could have imagined for two people with a bed so comfortable I didn't want to get out of it and just having a general ease about it. Camille was quick to respond when I had a question about the space which I really appreciated. I don't think I realized they had a washer dryer initially but was so thankful because I went through everything I'd packed pretty quickly in the Texas heat. My only complaints would have been the playstation which doubled as a dvd player - it ended up not working which was a little frustrating- so no TV use while there. I'm a survivor though and had packed my laptop for evening Netflix and chill. I would without a doubt stay here again and I'd hope they'd have me back as well!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was great.  Little bit far of a walking distance to downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I adored this place! We had such an amazing time in Austin and it was perfect to have this lovely, spacious, safe place to come back to after shopping or a night out. Comfy bed, shower w great water pressure (it's the little things!), short Uber ride to anywhere that was beyond walking distance, and amazing hosts. They provided so many wonderful tips and ideas for food and where to hang in the city. Check in was a breeze because of clear direction and details. Would certainly stay again if I make it back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Ames and Camille's place was great! Clean, cozy and well kept! It's in a nice quiet neighborhood but also very close to everything fun! Loved our stay :) "
,,,,,,,,"The place was nice, inviting and clean. Neighborhood was great. Close to what we needed. Very suitable for a family, not so much 4 adults sharing. "
,,,,,,,,everything was simple and well sorted. thanks!
,,,,,,,,Ames was an outstanding host with a wonderful home.  He gave a detailed set of instructions for everything we could possibly need to know about the home and neighborhood. We were able to check in and out effortlessly and had plenty of privacy. The location was perfect with a very quiet neighborhood but still just a short trip to 6th St. and other attractions. Everything was very clean and there is plenty of space for 4 people.  
8268045,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"5 Star Location- 5 Star Host -   Rocky went beyond in facilitating a great stay for a quick business trip.  Great for a getaway, a business trip or even a staycation.  Highly Recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Rocky was the perfect host and we couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. Any questions we had, he responded to almost immediately any time of the day. He even came to greet us and make sure everything was ok on our first day but also gave us privacy for the rest of the trip. 
The accommodation was perfect for our purposes. Comfy bed, very clean, lovely feel to the studio. Rocky provided beers, spirits, non-alcoholic drinks and plenty of water in the fridge along with breakfast bars on the side. What a pleasant surprise! We were even able to make use of the outdoor patio with the wonderful view of downtown!! Honestly, we couldn't fault it! 
The studio was in a great neighbourhood, only a short walk to West 6th. We loved the area and would definitely stay there again in the future. Thanks for your hospitality, Rocky! "
,,,,,,,,"Rocky was a fantastic host. My sister and I decided to have a fun ""sister weekend"" in Austin and his place was perfect for just that. We were close to Rainey, 6th street, and South Congress and even spent time exploring the diner and record stores just a short walk away from his place.  The studio was lovely and beautifully decorated. The backyard area was great and we would have enjoyed a few beers out there had it not been raining the whole time! Thanks for the memories, Rocky! "
,,,,,,,,Great location in Downtown. Quiet and pleasant stay. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,"My partner and I stayed in Rocky's studio during our first trip to Austin and Texas. We had a great time in Austin and the studio was a quiet retreat for us. 

When we arrived, we were surprised to discover the studio is near the Hope Outdoor Gallery. This meant finding a car park close by was a bit of a challenge in the day time. The street was busy with tourists visiting the gallery. But we were able to find a park in a nearby street so it's only a minor hassle. 

The studio itself is quite hidden away in back end of a hillside house which meant we didn't hear any noise. It was very private. 

Be prepared to go up a few steps to the studio at the back of the house. The path around the house to the studio is a little narrow (and was wet when we visited) so may be difficult for those with large bags. 

The studio apartment is neat and charming with enough room for 2 people. There is a small kitchenette suitable for only very basic self-catering. 

The bed is ok. The bathroom was clean and tidy. 

We were pleased to be provided with snacks during our stay. Thanks!

Overall we had good experience and I would recommend to couples or single travelers looking for a quiet place to stay close to downtown. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Rocky's studio was fantastic. Beautiful home and a perfect location for exploring Austin! The home was stocked with snacks and drinks, and even had AppleTV for some late night movies! Rocky was a very responsive host, and was quick to give us great recommendations for things to do in the area. I would recommend Rocky's place to any friend!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Studio had plenty of space, was super clean, and the bed was really comfortable! Rocky was really responsive when I had questions about the Wifi. Would definitely stay again! "
,,,,,,,,Rocky was a great Host. I had another host cancel on me the day before my trip and Rocky saved me. He was able to accommodate my early arrival and late check out within 24hrs. I stayed in the back studio where it was very private and the space is fairly large for a studio. I enjoyed the patio with a nice cup of tea in the mornings. The location was close to downtown and easily accessible. I would recommend taking a yoga class at Black Swan Yoga or getting oysters at Clark's Oyster Bar. Enjoy Austin!
,,,,,,,,Just got home from a perfect weekend getaway in Austin! Apartment couldn't have been in a better location. Totally walkable. Room was super clean and had waters and snacks for a nice extra touch. Rockys instructions on getting to and from apartment were super easy. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends! 
,,,,,,,,"Rocky was a great host and responded quickly.

The studio located in a great location. Quite and within walking distance (up to 30 minutes) from every central location in the city.

The studio itself was clean and cosy. "
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I went to Austin for a quick weekend trip and stayed at Rocky's place. This was our first Airbnb experience and thankfully, it was a great one! Although we didn't get to meet Rocky, he was very responsive via text and even suggested some things for us to do. 

His place was amazing! Tucked away at the back of the house was our little area to stay. It was the perfect amount of space and had a great view of downtown Austin! We had a lazy night and came back after dinner to watch Netflix! Thankful for a clean place and all the amenities!"
,,,,,,,,"Rocky was an incredible host.  Accommodating and helpful.  He was quick to respond to text messages and made sure to also give us our privacy.  The room is magical, nestled up in the hills with a great view of the city.  Great food/parks/sights nearby.  Safe, fun neighborhood.  Graffiti Wall two doors down, Waterloo Records down a couple blocks away.  The room was perfect for me and my girlfriend.  The kitchenette has everything you need, comfortable bed, and great windows and lighting.  Rocky even left us a little starter log for the small fireplace outside in the garden, a great place for coffee and an amazing view of the Capitol Building!  We can't say enough good things about this place and during our next trip to Austin we will hope to come back! "
,,,,,,,,"Rocky's place was great. The location was close to everything or an easy uber ride away, it was peaceful, and interesting being a door or two from the huge graffiti gallery. Every time you walked by it was different! Rocky was a very helpful and flexible host, and provided a clean space for us to launch our adventures from. I probably had breakfast at Austin Java around the corner like everyday. "
,,,,,,,,"I just got back from my wonderful stay in Austin at this adorable little studio! Rocky could not have been a more gracious host!! He gave me WONDERFUL suggestions on places to go where I had delicious meals and met some super fantastic people! The studio was located in a perfect area. I walked mostly everywhere. There is a great graffiti park just a little ways down from the house w/some really beautiful pieces. The studio had everything I needed and I was super comfortable. My favorite thing about it was the little patio area for morning coffee. It was perfect for me, as I was traveling alone. The steps are a great workout and provide for the lovely view. Rocky couldn't have been more sweet. Making sure I had everything I needed and even offered to lend me a jacket as it was a bit chiller than expected. Truly a wonderful trip. I will definitely be back soon!   "
,,,,,,,,Rocky was simply awesome. It was a last minute hosting request but he made it happen with grace and warmth. The stairs from the street are worth it since you get deposited in a quiet sanctuary nestled on the edge of downtown.
,,,,,,,,Rocky was very helpful.  The location is good for walking to shops and restaurants.
,,,,,,,,"We had an increadible weekend in Austin and Rocky's personality and house was a great complement for the trip. Excellent host that was very informative recommending places to visit plus the location was perfect, specially if you are interested in having fun in sixth Street and not worrying to drive because it's walking distance. The place it's kept very clean and it has a very charming outdoor. 

Very grateful with Rocky for letting us renting your home."
,,,,,,,,"The listing is accurately depicted. Rocky was a responsive and welcoming host. He was kind enough to give us dining suggestions for the many neighborhood spots.
One of the benefits to staying at this place was the choices for breakfast. We liked 24 Diner, Austin Java and Whole Foods- they were all short walks from Rocky's place.  
We would certainly stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Rocky is a great host. He did everything possible to make me feel at home. The place was really cool with every possible convenience. The neighborhood is in transition but was safe. The stairs are a killer so if you're a senior or have bad knees, you met be challenged. All in all, it was a good experience. "
,,,,,,,,Great little cozy hideaway.  Very comfortable and well furnished.  Walking distance to many great spots.  Rocky was a very attentive host and I would stay again.  
,,,,,,,,"I loved my experience with Rocky and as a frequent Austin visitor will definitely be staying there again (including next weekend hopefully!)

Here's why Rocky's place is so great:
LOCATION: I lived in Austin for 5 years and Rocky's place is in THE best location in the city. Walking distance from lots of my fave places (Whole Foods, many brunch spots, Josephine House, Caffe Medici) and spitting distance from the HOPE Outdoor Graffiti gallery.
QUIET: Got great sleep the entire time I was there.
STYLE: Great feng shui in there! I loved hanging out in the studio.
RESPONSIVE: Rocky was super available the entire time I was in the studio and helped me arrange things with AirBnB to make my stay the best and easiest it could be. A+ for Rocky!"
,,,,,,,,I had a wonderful and relaxing time.  I was able to walk everywhere from running on town lake to reading at the local coffee shop.  The place is perfectly maintained and tailored to your every need.  It was the perfect escape and I will be back.
,,,,,,,,"You MUST stay here when you're in Austin. Rocky was a dream host. The studio was straight out of a magazine - cozy, comfortable, natural in the best way. There was a full supply of towels, soaps, and anything else you could want to use. Rocky stopped by to drop off fresh pairs and change out the towels mid-stay, and was always available whenever I needed him. I felt like I was in a high-end bed and breakfast, minus the breakfast! :) "
,,,,,,,,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Rocky's place. Rocky was there to greet me and make sure that I could get in okay. Prior to the visit and during the visit Rocky was very responsive to any questions I had. The place itself was a little oasis. The room was very comfortable and a nice size. It had a lovely outside seating area on the property that you could enjoy as well. The neighborhood is one of my favorite's in Austin, the Clarksville area. It is walking distance to Whole Foods and many great restaurants in the downtown area. I was able to run from the place and run the trails of Lady Bird Lake as well. I would highly recommend this place to anyone as it is charming and the house feels private and secluded yet right in the heart of Austin. I loved everything about it. 
"
,,,,,,,,"If Jack Kerouac was around to use Airbnb this is the kind of place that would inspire a novel. Totally hair place, clean comfortable with everything you need. Stocked with towels, toiletries, there was even a beer in the fridge. Walking distance to tons of cool restaurants, Whole Foods, and Book People bookstore. I definitely recommend the chicken and waffles at 24 diner. Rocky was super communicative and accommodating. I will be back. "
,,,,,,,,"Rocky's place great! In an amazing location (walkable to downtown, the original Whole Foods, Waterloo, etc). He had some amazing recommendations on where to eat and what to do locally! He was super attentive and flexible and made our stay really amazing! The place is great and ample space! The Apple TV was an awesome addition. Would definitely stay there again. Very great and Texas feel. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was charming and very comfortable. Loved sitting out on the porch watching the sunrise against the Austin skyline. 

Rocky was awesome and made me feel very comfortable. Will be back soon. "
,,,,,,,,"Al was timely, polite, and accommodating. The neighborhood is close to downtown, and right by the flagship Whole Foods. The apartment was clean and tidy, along with clean linens, and nice beverages and snacks. He even picked up and Apple TV, which he didn't have to do. All around a great experience in Austin, TX!"
,,,,,,,,Couldn't have asked for a better first time experience on AirBnb. Al was quick to respond and filled me in on all the necessary info. The apartment is perfectly comfortable and ideal for someone who simply needs the basics. The area is great too with there being a huge outdoor graffiti gallery just down the street. I would highly recommend staying here if you're in town for a couple days and want to be close to the action. Thanks again Al. 
1250575,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Great for a large group that wants to be near Rainey street. The bunk beds were a little uncomfortable and noisy but not terrible. Good space for groups. Nice kitchen area and having the three bathrooms was good too. Jason was responsive and helpful. 
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is very sweet and at a convenient spot. Although it's not super spacious, it's comfortable enough for 5 people to stay. The place overall is pretty cozy. The location is only several minutes' drive away from Sixth Street, where the nightlife happens. We really enjoyed staying there. We'll definitely recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,Was great minus the roommate style bunk beds in every room. Would have liked a big bed/master bedroom 
,,,,,,,,Jason was a great host! Would definitely stay at his house in the future.
,,,,,,,,David was a great host! Very efficient and quick to respond to emails and texts. The home was a perfect location and short walk to Rainey street. We had such a great time in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Jason's place is awesome. A welcoming environment.
,,,,,,,,Great place and definitely walking distance to Rainey and 6th. The house was exactly what we were looking for. Kind of inflexible on early check in unless we paid half for the night before that we weren't even staying there. There was an issue with getting the code for checkin but was quickly resolved by Jason. Great place overall!
,,,,,,,,"The house is so fantastic that it is the best Airbnb I've ever had so far! It is a three-floor house, and the furnitures are pretty charming. Don't hesitate if the pictures consist to the house. It's definitely the same! The location of the house is great. And Jason is pretty helpful! He gave me a lot help before we checked in. I highly recommend this house."
,,,,,,,,The check in process was so easy since Jason was in constant communication with us.  The location was perfect for Rainey St. and it was the perfect home for visiting with family.  
,,,,,,,,Your place was really nice. It was close to a number of great restaurants and coffee shops all within walking distance. We will definitely  return to your house on our next trip to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place was in an amazing location on the East side of Austin. It's an up and coming neighborhood with a ton of great restruants and coffee shops, but still less than 10 minutes away from South Congress. The rooms were clean and the house had everything we needed. Jason was a great communicator and quick to answer questions. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"Jason was very communicative throughout the entire process leading up to my stay, as we were checking in, and during the stay. The place was incredible in an amazing location while I was traveling for a work conference. I'd love to stay there again and would recommend this place for anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The house is definitely close enough to walk to nightlife and downtown. Very easy access from the highway if you are driving in. We did explore East Austin and had a great time along with the usual downtown locations. 

The house is three levels and was large enough for our group of 6. The 2.5 bathrooms really made the difference. Most of our days were spent at our convention or exploring the city The house just became a place to rest for the next day. Beds are fine and maybe a little on the noisy side if you roll around a lot.

For the location and amenities it is a solid choice for all visits to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Great place in a great location!
,,,,,,,,"Great location adjacent to Rainey St. and Downtown. Also right next to Interstate, making for easy access to everywhere. Plenty of room. "
,,,,,,,,The house way a great place to stay for a conference at the convention center.
,,,,,,,,"The host made sure that we have all the details for the stay and was available to text right away if anything was wrong. The amenities were great including wi-fi. Only problem was cleanliness of the living room because it was apparent someone was either using it before us or that it was not cleaned before we got there. Also the linens, including the futon cover were dirty with stains and bed hair. Otherwise everything else was fine."
,,,,,,,,"Jason did a great job at providing info, being responsive and providing great spots in the neighborhood to check out. Location was great... walking distance to Rainey, 6th Street, and the hip East Austin area.  Also very close to the lake/river, parks down there and the jogging path.  Nice comfortable space as well."
,,,,,,,,Great location.
,,,,,,,,Great Trip
,,,,,,,,We checked in last minute and Jason was quick to respond and very helpful and accommodating. This is in a great location and was plenty of space for us. 
,,,,,,,,Great stay in a great neighborhood. Jason was easy and responsive to communicate with. Would stay again.
,,,,,,,,Positive experience. Would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,oved the house... Super clean and the style was amazing... Location was perfect..the host was the best... Super sweet... I would recommend this house over any house so far.
,,,,,,,,Amazing location and a perfect setup for an extended weekend in Austin! Six of us stayed comfortably at Jason's place. He was easy to communicate with and responded quickly to both texts and emails. I would definitely recommend Jason's place to anyone looking to enjoy Rainey Street and the rest of downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,"House was in an Amazing location close walking distance to Rainy Street, 5th street and Downtown!! Jason was very quick in responding via email. Would defiantly recommend Jason's place to friends and family!!"
,,,,,,,,"House is very cool and in an amazing location.  We had three people in our party, but we would have been comfortable with a few more.  Great location for a large group of friends.  The house was not as clean as I'd expected."
,,,,,,,,Awesome!!
,,,,,,,,Great communication and quick response. Very helpful and everything was as advertised.
,,,,,,,,Jason was very responsive when I had questions which was very helpful and the place was spacious and perfect for our stay.
,,,,,,,,"Our host Jason was very easy to communicate with. The property was perfect for groups of friends traveling to Austin. Clean, plenty of space. The location was also fantasic. Neighbour Jerry is a few doors down and can cook up a mean brisket for your group at a great price. Would recommend this property to anyone. "
,,,,,,,,Great house.  Great location.  It was perfect for our group. Jason was very accommodating and made the whole process super easy. 
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay at Jason's house near Rainey!  It was very well put together and easy walk to the fantastic bars/restaurants on rainey street.  I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Austin!
,,,,,,,,My friends and I had a great experience in Jason's house! It was a fantastic location and   we loved everything about the house. Jason was also very easily contacted and responded quickly to any questions that I had. Definitely recommend his home! Thanks Jason! 
,,,,,,,,"The house is in a great a location.  Walking distance to anything you could possibly want in Austin.  The neighborhood is quiet and felt very safe even at night.  The house itself is very nice but wasn't entirely clean when we arrived despite the host charging a $100 cleaning fee and having extensive rules around cleanliness.  The bathrooms could use a deep cleaning (moldy shower & curtain), there were cigarette butts and other trash strewn throughout the backyard, and there was dirt/leaves from outside on the floor.  You would think the place would be spotless given the cleaning fee and the amount of rules the host has but that was not the case.  The bedrooms have 3 bunk beds in each room that reminded me of a low-priced South American hostel (wobbly frames, thin mattresses and worn linens).  The host was not flexible whatsoever regarding early arrival or late checkout regardless as to if the house was rented or not before or after our stay.  No guests are allowed on the property and there are more rules that are required to be agreed to (via a signed contract and $2,000 deposit) than I have ever seen when renting a place.  For the $$$ we spent per night (granted it was a holiday weekend), there are probably nicer cleaner places out there with more flexible hosts in Austin.    "
,,,,,,,,We stayed here while attending a conference at the Austin Convention Center and found the location very convenient. Jason was very responsive and helped us accomodating last minute guest additions. We enjoyed our stay. 
,,,,,,,,The house was just as described by Jason.  It was a great location with plenty of room to our guest didn't feel 'on top of eachother'.  I would absolutely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,Jason was great to work with. He had patience in answering all of my questions and was easy to get a hold of. Our stay was great and we enjoyed that it was a short walk to several restaurants/bars in downtown. Thanks again!
,,,,,,,,This house is in a great location and fits medium sized groups very well.
,,,,,,,,The house was exactly what we were looking for. It is conveniently located near downtown. The house is clean and checking in and out was a breeze.  Great experience.
,,,,,,,,Great house with a lot of space and an amazing location (walk to very cool Rainey street bars). Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,The house was great.  Lots of space and a few blocks walk to popular Rainey street and 6th street.   Jason was very attentive and helpful.  I would def stay there again if traveling to Austin again. 
,,,,,,,,Our stay in Austin was great from start to finish.  The house was in a perfect location and everything was clean and modern.  All the accomadations inside were well maintained and everything we needed was provided.  Would absolutely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"The place is amazing. It has perfect walking access to both Rainey and 6th street. It is clean, modern and has plenty of fun stuff to do when not enjoying the town (cornhole, beerpong, foosball). Jason was great to work with, coordinating reservation, arrival, and departure extremely well. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a good time in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a bachelor party here, and we were ecstatic with the area.  A close walk to rainey street bars and food trucks, and a close jog to a running track on the water.  The house was perfect for a bachelor party, Jason has a beer pong table, and a fenced in yard so we didn't have to worry about neighbor complaints. Cab rides were cheap to 6th street. Seven of us stayed the weekend and we were all happy we didn't get a hotel room.  Jason was very cool and accommodating about check in and check out.  I definitely recommend this place for bachelor parties, or if you just want to see Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Jason was great. He went above and beyond to accomidate us. We had 18 people for a bachelor party. That in itself is incredibly stressful. I am glad I was able to deal with someone that understood we needed transparency in the renting process and Jason did that for us. He answered all questions quickly and clearly. The house was great. All 18 of us had a place to sleep and even though the house is not that large (for 18 people at least)... we were by no means bumping into each other. It was such a great location to walk to Rainey and 6th Street. We did not use a cab for the entire weekend wich allowed us to spend all of our money at the bars instead. I recommend the house and Jason to anyone wanting to take in what Austin has to offer. 
,,,,,,,,"Jason was an excellent host and the house was amazing. We took full advantage of the Foosball table, ping pong table, and Apple TV. The house was within walking distance of Rainey Street, which our group thoroughly enjoyed. We had a group of 15 stay for 2 nights and everyone was able to find a comfortable place to sleep. I would definitely stay at this house when I visit Austin again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place for a group trip to Austin!  We held my brother's bachelor party here. The location is super-convenient to cool areas of Austin, including walking distance to 6th Street for bar-hopping.

The house accommodated 12 people, although it was a tight fit for that many guys. 12 people is a bit of a stretch, but it's perfect for a slightly smaller group.

We made good use of the Apple TV for music, and the beer pong table was a huge hit with the group.

Jason was a fabulous host, always reachable for questions before our visit, as well as during. Can't ask for anyone easier to deal with!"
,,,,,,,,"This has to be one of the best places in Austin as far as location, quality of house, price, and how great Jason is.  He was very flexible with our check in and out and was great with cleanup.  Could not recommend more!"
9616657,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Excellent home in a great neighborhood close to downtown! Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"A lovely home and very convenient to downtown Austin. We walked all over- Ladybird Lake, state capitol, Whole Foods, restaurants. Comfortable, sparking clean, great kitchen. We really enjoyed it! "
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful home. It was such a cute cozy place. The house was very comfortable and clean. The location couldn't have been better. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend to others! :-)
,,,,,,,,We had a great time at this place. The location is perfect and the house is beautiful. 
,,,,,,,,"Gorgeous house, great location as we could walk downtown in less than 30 minutes. Would definitely stay here again"
,,,,,,,,"The home is beautiful and we had everything we needed for our weekend.  Great location was close to everything, including nice running trails.  The only negative would be the noise from the apartment tenants next door.  "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed here for a long weekend trip to Austin. We were 4 adults and 1 baby.  The house was in a central location and it was very easy to get to downtown and east Austin.  The house was clean and modern. 

Our only complaint is that the house wasn't a great fit for our 8 month old. I wouldn't recommend the house for babies. Although the rental company was very helpful in providing a pack n play and high chair, each room had a skylight and our baby was unable to nap. Also, the neighborhood isn't very quiet - we heard the play by play of the local high school football game late on Friday night. "
,,,,,,,,Enjoyed the 4th weekend. House was nice and beds were comfortable. Thanks for everything. 
,,,,,,,,"This being my first AirBnB experience I can only hope they are all as great.  We arrived to a gorgeous, well kept house in a fantastic part of Austin and our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.  The property is clean with a lovely layout and perfect for accessing downtown. I highly recommend this listing to anyone looking to visit Austin."
12954899,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Sarah's place was great. It was super clean, smelled great. The bed was ahhhhmazing. It was so soft. Everything about it. The mattress. The pillows. The sheets. We also really loved Tilly (her pup). Just be careful and make sure you close your door all the day or Tilly will try to jump into bed with you. Though we loved and welcomed it, that may not be everyone's thing. There is also private parking. We only used it once because it was VERY steep (which Sarah said straight up and was honest about). We didn't feel comfortable going up and down it so we parked on the street which wasn't difficult to find. What was also great about it, was the location. It's right next to graffiti park. If we ever find ourselves in Austin again (and we definitely plan to come back) we'll definitely check out Sarah's place again. "
,,,,,,,,Spacious room with great host. Not for people afraid of dogs / cats even though I loved them! :)
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a complete lifesaver as I ended up having to find a place to stay overnight last minute. She was on-point when it came to providing all the necessary information, and extremely friendly as well, providing great insights on the downtown area and what to do! Doesn't hurt that she's literally right next to Castle Hill's grafitti park either! Highly recommended"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah and her boyfriend made me feel right at home. They also have a dog and cat who are both very friendly. The listing was just as advertised: clean, convenient location, and the Internet worked great. I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Sarah's place is simply perfect! Great location to all the good spots on West 6th and a 24 hour diner with great food 2 mins walk around the corner. The bedroom is adorable and the bed couldn't be more comfortable! The pets are a nice homely touch too and the decor is very unique and stylish. Sarah is the type of girl you will love straight off the bat and was very accommodating and helpful to me and my best friend who just moved to town! We loved it and I will most certainly recommend Sarah's place to friends and family who visit us in Austin :) 
,,,,,,,,We had a pleasant stay at Sarah's. Everything was as described. The app to open the front door can be a little tricky. Pull the door towards you while it's unlocking and it should work.
,,,,,,,,"Very comfortable bed and welcoming host. As mentioned, it is pretty close quarters with the guests staying in the adjacent room and with whom you share the bathroom. The graffiti park next door is cool! 35 min walk to conference center. 10 minutes to Whole Foods "
,,,,,,,,Sarah's place was great. Literally next door to the graffiti park. Bed was huge and comfy and bathroom was clean with all the amenities you could need. Sarah was super friendly and helpful and we absolutely loved cuddles with her dog and cat. Would highly recommend Sarah's place :)
,,,,,,,,I stayed here while attending a conference downtown. The room is nice and clean. I did not have any issues or problems. Sarah was very helpful coordinating keys for my late night arrival.
,,,,,,,,It was a very smooth experience. Enjoyed my stay at Sarah's place. 
,,,,,,,,I had a very comfortable stay at Sarah's. The house was nice and the room was as described. Would recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Amazing stay and host!! Sarah was such a joy as a hostess. Her communication was super. The house was so cute, our bedroom extra nice with very comfy king bed!! Location, location, location  this airbnb is next to the Hope Outdoor Gallery, an amazing outdoor installation that changes daily!!!! Sarah was very helpful and we felt as home from the first second. We also loved Tilly her big puppy! Thank you Sarah, hope to see you again soon! Cheers Angela"
,,,,,,,,The best experience so far. 
,,,,,,,,Great room! Fun house and cool neighborhood! We loved the king size bed and the location - easy walk to ACL. Thank you Sarah!
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a pleasure to stay with, and her puppy is adorable."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah is awesome! Very responsive to questions/concerns. I had reservations about access to the front door, but it was super simple and she sent additional instructions. 
 
Most comfortable bed we've ever slept in and if you can't tell from the picture, it's a KING! I miss that bed...

Location is central to many Austin attractions and restaurants. Bring your spray paint cans if you want to mark the graffiti wall just next door;)"
,,,,,,,,"House is very clean, bed and pillow rival top hotels. Easy walk to 6th street. Dog was super friendly, cat was just cat."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay. Great host. Location is perfect it is close to everything. Would stay again when we are in Austin next time for sure. 
,,,,,,,,Great host!
,,,,,,,,"While this is a good location and the bed is a nice size (and very comfortable!), we did not have a great experience at Sarah's home, unfortunately. Sarah sent me a link to an app to use to open the front door for arrival and instructions for where a spare key was in case the app was not working. Sarah provided no instructions on how to use the app and once I figured it out, the app told me that the door was jammed. Sarah's instructions stated that there was a lock box close to the door and listed a code, which I used to open the box however there was no key! Sarah was not very responsive to my texts and when she finally responded, she asked who I was. I was finally able to locate a key (extremely confusing on how to eventually locate the key), and in the end we had been at the house for 45 minutes before we were able to get inside. The app did not work for the entire duration of our stay and getting in and out was a nightmare. When we arrived inside, I was surprised to find that there was another room being rented out to other Airbnb guests as well, and that we would have to share one tiny bathroom with them! It was difficult to try and coordinate going to the bathroom/showering with the random other guests. They were very nice and it worked out fine, but would've been nice to know. The host also has a dog (VERY large dog) that is in the home, which was fine, but Sarah left the dog for an entire day and free to roam around the house. We were able to take him outside to go to the bathroom and feed him, however felt it was inappropriate for Sarah to leave him unattended for that many hours (8+). The dog is also a young dog and very excited, running throughout the house and barging into rooms if the door is not shut completely. Sweet dog, but just a little strange that he was left unattended and free to roam about. Unfortunately, there was some tension between Sarah and my friends once these issues were brought to light. Again, great location and comfortable bed, but unfortunately will not be back. "
,,,,,,,,Sara and her roommate were super sweet.  Bed is super comfortable.  Very clean and updated house.  Fair walking distance to 6th street but totally doable for the adventurous.  And yet far enough from party central to be quiet and restful at night.  They have a cool pay it forward gift concept that is optional for guests who wish to participate.  It was perfect for our needs!
,,,,,,,,I had a wonderful experience! The location is great and Sarah was extremely friendly. 
,,,,,,,,Convienent stay. Appreciated the door access for late travelers.
,,,,,,,,"I would simply call it home away from home . Amazing comfy bed , exactly what I needed after a long flight . Sarah is a 5star host and showed great hospitality certainly made my stay amazing . No wonder her rooms are always booked . Great comfy clean room , location is perfect for me also great value ! Yes will definitely stay here again !"
,,,,,,,,Interesting and convenient location. My host greeted me and helped me get settled.
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was an awesome host. She was so friendly and helpful. The place was very cute, clean and convenient. We really enjoyed staying our weekend at her place!!! "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a great host! We had a short but sweet stay in Austin, and she greeted us at the door and showed us our room. She was super friendly, although we didn't have much interaction since we were there for such a short time. The room was super comfortable (I slept for 10 hours!) and the place was overall clean. The location was close to downtown, and we were able to park in front of the house up a steep hill (non street parking), which was nice since we had a lot of belongings in our car. Would stay here again if we're ever in Austin again!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was very helpful, nice and accommodating, as was her boyfriend. The location is very convenient and the room and the bed are awesome!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was an amazing host! This cozy hilltop home was a pleasure to stay at. The room and restrooms were spotless. The home has plenty of restaurants near by and not that far from the Austin ""scene'.  I would recommend this location to friends and others living in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a fantastic host, even remotely!  She was able to accommodate me with a quick turnaround and was very communicative at every step of the way.  Everything was as described in the listing and her guide was very detailed.  Overall, a great experience in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was very helpful; the room was perfectly clean and there were convenient amenities provided (tissues, towels, washclothes, etc.) that were easily accessible. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah is an excellent host!  We loved her use of technology (keyless entry)-- she sent us an app that allowed for easy in/out during our stay. Loved the locations.  It's is near a cool surprise gem of Austin. I won't tell you anymore as it would spoil the surprise :)  Room, bath, linens, floors, kitchen where extremely well kept but comfy to our enjoyment.  We even ran into our new friend downtown while we on a brew tour and had (1) with her.  If your in Austin, it's probably to enjoy the sites and sounds --- this location was a 5-10min car service to the LAKE RESTAURANT piers.  A must...  Back to Sarah and her COZY HILLTOP HOME.  It is most definitely all she claimed before our arrival.  We'd definitely stay at her place in the future. GREAT VALUE COMPARED TO ANY HOTEL IN THE AREA."
,,,,,,,,"This location was amazing. I was close to everything and literally next door to one of Austen's most photographed park. Sarah was extremely hospitable, we even ended up going to the same event. The house was very clean and nicely decorated. Only downside was that we missed sunrise at castle hill because we couldn't get out of the comfortable bed. "
,,,,,,,,The experience was fantastic.  Sarah and the gang were spectacular hosts and the location was phenomenal.
,,,,,,,,"Great amenities, beautiful place, great location, and super friendly hostess. I highly recommended.  "
,,,,,,,,"This was a wonderful experience.  The house is beautiful, Sara is caring and the location is great.  Sara went above and beyond what is expected out of a good host.  In addition, her boyfriend even went and picked up some OTC medication for us.  I would recommend my friends to stay here."
5106222,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Everything was exactly as pictured. Communication was perfect. Great stay!
,,,,,,,,Great stay at a great place! I highly recommend to anyone and everyone going to Austin 
,,,,,,,,"This is a beautiful, modern property with *extremely* comfy beds. Laura, the property manager, was available via text whenever we needed her. 5 coworkers and I stayed here for a work trip to Austin and it was delightful."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay.  Everything in this place is high end with no expense spared on high end furniture.   I highly recommend this place.   
,,,,,,,,"We loved working with the Property Manager, Laura, leading up to our stay here at this amazing home!  We were in town visiting for a friend's wedding weekend and 10 adults (and one adorable 6 week old) all slept super comfortably here at the home.  Plenty of comfy spaces to relax here either in the awesomely modern combo kitchen/dining, living room, screened in patio or enjoying a little sun poolside!  The property was exactly as pictured and Laura was so easy to work with.  Super thankful for the many memories made here at this wonderful home!"
,,,,,,,,Our stay at Wallerspace could not have been more enjoyable! The location and the attentiveness to our every need were unsurpassed by other vacation home rentals. Laura and Kevin are first class in every way! 5 stars on all fronts! Rent this space if you want your accommodations  in Austin to be perfect for you and your group. 
,,,,,,,,"When I originally booked this Airbnb I thought - this is crazy expensive, but it was the only one near rainy street available so I booked it. 

Now, I'll stay here every time I come to Austin with a group - amazing!!! Laura is ridiculously helpful & responsive with suggestions on what to do, where to go, and any questions you have. The house itself is spacious so people can hangout in various parts or all together. They even have an app with info on a concierge service, how to get into the house, info on the sonos speakers etc. I cannot rave enough about this place - worth every penny!"
,,,,,,,,We had such an amazing time in Austin! The house is so close to rainy street. It's extremely clean and packed with entertainment. The pool/house is larger then in the pictures. I am inspired to build a home like this one day.
,,,,,,,,"Excellent experience with the house! Great location, amenities and feel. I would definitely bring a group back to Waller Street!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was beautiful and perfect for a large group! The location was perfect as well! We enjoyed being able to walk to Rainey street and down to ladybird lake for paddle boarding. The pool and out door lounging space was also perfect for relaxing with my girlfriends! Would definitely stay here again, we felt like we were staying in a Real World house!!!"
,,,,,,,,"House was just as expected from the pictures. Great pool area for our hot trip and it is walking distance to Rainey St or Caesar Chavez for nightlife, food, and shops.

The best part was host was very accommodating and was in constant communication by email and text for anything we needed or any issues we had."
,,,,,,,,"Great house, perfect location and the team was highly communicative throughout the rental period and days leading to our trip."
,,,,,,,,"Kevin's place was the perfect spot for our group of 10! The house is spacious (yet still feels intimate), impeccably decorated, and in such a great location (within walking distance to countless bars, restaurants, etc.). Laura (the house manager) was always available if we had any questions, and was super helpful in accommodating our early check-in and late check-out. We loved our stay and would absolutely recommend it to anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The host, property and location could not have been better for our group! The house manager Laura was exceptional in her attention to detail a trait that was visible throughout the property. Everything was perfect! I cannot understate how impressed my group of 6 guys were with the property! "
,,,,,,,,"Me and my group had an excellent time at this house! We were conveniently located to the downtown area. When we weren't eating BBQ, we were at the house relaxing in the pool or the large common area. Would return in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed in this home for ~5 days for a conference being held in downtown Austin. First, the location is excellent -- safe, well-lit and within walking distance (.3 miles/.5 km) of lots of great restaurants/bars on Rainey street. It's easy to grab an Uber/Lyft and head into the city, and it's only 15 minutes from the airport. The house itself is better than the pictures, super clean and has great amenities. We appreciated the well-stocked kitchen and double washer/dryer. Nest thermostats make it easy to keep the house at the temperature you like.

Everyone also really liked the Sonos sound system (one in the living room, one in an upstairs bedroom) which was easy to connect to and great for music (there was a Spotify/Pandora account already connected). The WiFi is very good and has repeaters for each floor so you get a good signal in any room of the house.

Check-in and Check-out was easy and the house manager kept in touch with us throughout the week via text message. They were attentive to our questions and even dropped off a huge inflated swan for the pool mid-week which made the already very nice pool even better.

Overall we had an outstanding experience at this home and would highly recommend it for anyone looking to stay in Austin. We'll definitely be back next year!"
,,,,,,,,"This house is nothing short of spectacular. Clean, well designed, and extremely comfortable, this was the perfect accommodation for our party of 9 guys as we made our way through 4 days and 3 nights of incredible golf and BBQ. Kevin and Laura were absolutely amazing and made us feel right at home form the moment we arrived in town."
,,,,,,,,"Such a wonderful house and location. We spent a long weekend in Austin for a bachelorette party and couldn't have asked for a better location or accommodations. The house is beautifully designed-so you really feel like you are being pampered- and it is equipped with all the essentials. 
The house manager was in contact but not imposing making it easy to ask questions. 
The house is close to the river path for easy access to exercising and kayaks in our case. It is also close walking to the party/bar scene on Rainey St. Up the street are more coffee shops and restaurants. There is also a park for kids a few blocks away. 
Five stars! "
,,,,,,,,"Laura is a great host. Really friendly, flexible and available. House is great for a big group looking to explore Austin but also have some quiet time at the house. "
,,,,,,,,We had an amazing girls getaway at this house. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very clean and decorated beautifully. The pool and screened in porch were perfect for us! The house is located near (URL HIDDEN) was easy to get anywhere from the house.  We could not be happier with our choice of this house!
,,,,,,,,"Loved our stay in this gorgeous house. Beds were comfortable, the house was clean, the kitchens are enormous and impressive, plus plenty of space for our large group. Dealing with Laura was easy and she was super helpful throughout our stay. Can't wait to come back."
,,,,,,,,"This listing is as beautiful as the pictures portray.  The bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable.   The modern decor was so urban and chic and the natural light flooding the house really made it feel like vacation.  This was the perfect house for our group of 5 couples from Chicago who left 16 kids behind to have some fun in Austin.  The sonos speakers in the house were put to good use.  We even used the pool in February!  In addition, the location allowed us to walk everywhere we needed to get to.   Rainey street is a fun party and I strongly recommend the Rocket Electrics gastro pub bike tour.  So fun discovering dive bars with amazing food trucks in the back.  The house manager Laura was quick to reply and very helpful.  This place lived up to the reviews I had read.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful house with plenty of space to relax, enjoy a meal at home, and sleep comfortably for a big group. Very convenient location for 6th St, Rainey St, and the generally downtown area. Kevin and Laura were both very responsive to requests we had during our stay and made sure we had everything included in the listing. They also made the scheduling process a breeze!"
,,,,,,,,Great house in a great location to explore Austin. Well-designed for a large group with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms. The host and house manager were extremely responsive and answered all questions immediately. Austin is a really fun city.  There were a few small problems. The pool was not clean so was unusable. There was no door to top bedroom so no privacy and no shades so hard to sleep past sunrise. The second floor smaller suite needs darker shades and reading lights next to the bed. The air mattress provided was not inflated so could not be used.  
,,,,,,,,"This property and the kind folks managing were the best we have experienced.  The property was as described and maintained wonderfully.  We had Thanksgiving dinner for 10 and there was space and equipment for perfect entertainment. The location was incredibly convenient to downtown and a quiet neighborhood.  Thank you and we are coming back, so please don't book it when we want it.  "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent house, well stocked with necessary items, comfortable, good wi-fi and climate control - everything one could ask for.  6 of us stayed without any issues and really enjoyed the house.  Host was really responsive and professional, great interacting with them.  Would definitely stay here again if we return."
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing place! Great location, lots of space for a group of 14. In addition, we were mostly couples so there was plenty of privacy (5 priv bedrooms and the 6th room was the top floor with two beds)  We were close to all of the action on Rainey street and it was very easy to get to the stadium and south congress area. Having access to the pool made the 95 degree manageable and great for all of us to hang out in. 

The hosts were great, easily accessible via phone or email.  They keep the place in tip top shape. DONT LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE, you will not regret staying here. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was amazing and I think even more impressive than the pictures portray. We had a large group and everyone was able to sleep comfortably.  Every bedroom is unique, clean and very comfortable. WiFi, sound system, pool, everything was functional and easy to use. I would definitely stay with Kevin again if the opportunity arose. "
,,,,,,,,"Kevin and his team were great hosts; accessible and very accommodating. The house was very clean and in great condition. Everything you could think of from bath towels, pool towels, grill, entertainment/sound system, body wash/shampoo, etc. not only did his house have but was high quality. There is plenty of common space perfect for relaxing and hanging out with your friends. The bedrooms were private and beds extremely comfortable (better than most high end hotels I've stayed in). The locations is outstanding. Rainey St. was less than a 10 minute walk and located close enough to the highway anytime we requested an Uber to go anywhere else we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes and the house was easy for drivers to find. I would highly recommend Kevin to anyone visiting Austin and hope to stay at this or one of his other properties on future visits.   "
,,,,,,,,"The house was amazing, and communication with David was super easy.  Our group had an A+ experience.   Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"Went down to Austin for a Bachelor party with a group of guys.  The house was fantastic and met all of my expectations.  It was clean, well maintained, and well equipped with modern technology including multiple large flat screen TVs, Wi-Fi, Sonos, and an awesome in ground pool.  Kevin was a great host and a quick responder with questions/concerns.  Definitely recommend booking with him and this house."
,,,,,,,,"My group had a fantastic experience in this beautifully designed house.  We were greeted with a sweet welcome bag, and extremely clean, well stocked (with clean towels, shampoo/conditioner/body wash) house.  We had a great time and would love to stay again next time we are in Austin!  Thank you Kevin!"
,,,,,,,,"This house is amazing - the pictures don't even do it justice. It's spacious, comfortable, beautiful and tasteful. There is great attention to detail: from the shampoo/body wash/soap in every bathroom, to comfortable beds, and great linens. It slept 13 of us comfortably and could have slept 14 of us. Lots of great communal space, too. We had two big meals at the house, and ate comfortably as well. The house was spotless. Kevin and his house manager were fabulous - they were very quick to respond before arrival and during our stay they were incredibly responsive with our questions. The location is great - walkable to bars on Rainey Street, and coffee/juice shops too. I'd recommend this house to anyone, and would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at the house with 10 other girls for a Bachelorette Party and had the best time.  The host made us feel very welcome and the house was just as the photos looked, VERY NICE & CLEAN! We enjoyed the outdoor space, grill and all the beds were really comfortable. It was really nice to be able to walk to Rainey Street ! We were able to get Ubers easily as well. I highly recommend this home ! "
,,,,,,,,"Kevin is a great host. From the moment we first started messaging, he's been super helpful.

The best part though is the house itself. It's just awesome. Booked it for a bachelor's party of 14 people and everyone fit, had a place to sleep and had a great time. The decorating is really hip -- overall a great house and guest that I'd recommend to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"the house was great and super clean/new. we unfortunately didn't get great weather while there but the pool looked great at least, and were still able to make the quick walk (around 10 mins) down to Rainey. Kevin was great and super accessible and offered up some great suggestions for things to do. we had a bachelor party of 10 and the house worked out perfectly for us. "
,,,,,,,,"This is a house meant for a party and celebrating with family and friends. It's perfectly laid out for entertaining and you can't beat the proximity to Rainey Street (4 block walk), East 6th street and downtown. We had a guys weekend with a group of 8 and thoroughly enjoyed hanging out in the house. The house is furnished in a modern style with a fantastic kitchen in an open layout...every room is very cool. The entire ground floor can be opened to the pool area which makes it great for hanging by the pool while others watch television. 

The neighborhood is being turned with several homes being remodeled. It felt very safe and there were lots of folks jogging throughout the day and several families with strollers walking around. Our group walked to Rainey street both days and also walked to East 6th street for dinner. The only driving we did was to the lake and for breakfast tacos at Juan in a Million which is approx. a mile away. 

Lastly, Kevin was a great host. He made sure we were comfortable, made recommendations and checked in a couple of times to make sure we had what we needed. He also started us off with some great local beers and left us a stocked bar. 

I highly recommend this house for a group. If I can convince a group of 6+ friends to join me in Austin again then this will be the first house I check. "
,,,,,,,,"Kevin was a great host. He was very responsive and attentive without being intrusive. The process with Kevin was best in class.

The house is incredible. The photos do not do it justice. Everything was beyond expectation - brand new, high quality, and tasteful. Super comfortable beds.

The location is tough to beat if you're going to be spending time downtown and need a central spot to jump on the freeway. Very short walk to Rainey. Easy uber all over the city. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything about our stay was excellent!  
Host:  
When we arrived at the airport I received a call from Kevin and got all the arrival info (house, wifi, and sonos codes), as well as great restaurant recommendations for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and some late night areas.  I text him a few times during our stay and he always responded right away and was very helpful.  Overall pleasure to deal with.   When we arrived at the house there was a a little welcome bag/gift with a nice note from the host.
Location:  
Great location in an up and coming neighborhood, with a quick 5 to 7 minute walk to the bars on Rainy St, and another 10 minutes from Rainy to 6th, but we spent 90% of our nights on Rainy.  
House:  
Amazing!!  We had a group of 12 guys and we were very comfortable.  Each area (living room, screened in patio, and pool area/backyard) were large enough for the entire group to hang out together.  The pool was a little chilly, but nice to jump in, especially for a group of us from Illinois in March!  All of the couches, beds, chairs, etc, were very comfortable and stylish.  The house was decked out with everything we needed, and then some.  Multi-room sonos system for great music, plenty of hd tv's, wifi, a nice grill on the patio, and gourmet kitchen fully equipped w/ cookware, high end appliances, and everything needed for us to cook and enjoy some meals at the house.  Everyone in our group thought the house was great, and would definitely stay here again!   I'm used to staying at 4/5 star resorts, and this was one of the best places I've stayed. 
I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a memorable house/experience in Austin.  Stop wasting time looking for anything else, and book this place if it's available.  You will not be disappointed! "
,,,,,,,,"The home was spectacularly furnished with brand new & modern pieces that created a fresh, clean feeling throughout. Kevin Burns and his team did a wonderful job in making sure we were all setup for SXSW, and were willing to go over backwards to help us. We plan on making this our destination for SXSW for the next coming years! "
,,,,,,,,"After another house fell through, our group of 5 needed a good place, and needed it fast. Kevin was exceptionally communicative and easygoing, and made the reservation a breeze. And the house...the house was amazing! It was brand new in early 2015, so it had a very ""new house"" feel. Bedrooms & bathrooms are perfectly arranged for a large group, the kitchen and living areas are stylish and spacious, and the neighborhood was very pleasant. All in all a great spot - highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"This house is pretty amazing! It's brand new and filled with stunning custom-made furniture and high end finishes (from the high thread count sheets and oversized heavy towels to the amazing sound system). All rooms were beautifully designed and finished and overall it was a perfect place from which to enjoy Austin.

Kevin was great: extremely responsive prior to and during the trip and very helpful and friendly throughout.

The location of the house was perfect, a 3 min walk to Rainey, close to the entire east side and a short uber or 15 min walk from downtown.

There was a strange cold front in town when we were there so we didn't get to enjoy the pool, but we plan in going back later in the year and will certainly be staying here."
,,,,,,,,"This place fit our needs perfectly and we all agreed we would stay here again in a heartbeat. The place is beautifully furnished and you can tell they took the time with all the details. Perfect for entertaining, we wish it was warmer outside so we could have fully taken advantage of the pool and screened in patio. Walking distance from rainy street and we could get a uber/lyft within five minutes any time of day. Kevin was a gracious and easily accessible host to try to accommodate our every need."
254232,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Eric's photos and description of the home are very accurate. He is a wonderful host, leaving us some basic food and treats, as well as a nice note, wifi and emergency instructions. Toiletries were also provided. Little touches that meant so much.
There is a beautiful patio for watching the birds and relaxing outside. 
This home is only a 5-minute ride away from downtown, but feels quiet enough to relax away from the craziness (SXSW week!).
The best airbnb experience I've had yet!"
,,,,,,,,"Great host, great house, great experience "
,,,,,,,,"Eric was very professional and answered any questions, comments, or concerns we had with booking. The house was great for my boss and colleague during their trip for SXSW. "
,,,,,,,,Eric was welcoming and wonderful!  His home is beautiful and is in a great neighborhood in Austin.  We can't wait to stay there again!  
,,,,,,,,Extremely nice home. Very comfortable. The pictures don't even do it justice. 
4059183,4,8,9,10,9,10,9,"The Good: The apartment was very nice, great view, outstanding common areas with poo, gym, large lounge ( with TV and internet and areas to hang out). Apartment is on top floor of the building, with a spectacular view of Austin.

Location: While not the host's fault, the train tracks run right next to the apartment and the freight trains run throughout the night. So guest will hear plenty of noise 3 times each night for 5-10 minutes or so. 

Listing Amenities inaccurate: The apartment was advertised to come with wireless high speed internet service and cable TV. It did not have these amenities. these were only available in the common area which is 15 floors below the apartment. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment with view of the river, Zilker Park and Downtown.  Beautiful modern finishes.  

Only downside was wifi access was only available in the building common space."
,,,,,,,,"Ed is great, so is his beautiful apartment. Great views with even better location, perfect for ACL. "
2918176,4.5,10,9,10,10,10,9,Erica's place was great; and was our second time staying there.  The location is quiet and very close to the downtown scene (west end); and the place is well-appointed.  
,,,,,,,,Everything you need in a convenient location.
,,,,,,,,"The key to this property is not to message them via Airbnb, but call the hotline phone #. In our short 3 day stay, I had 3 different people responding to my messages with a very long response time of around 10 hours each. This is possibly the biggest difference between booking with a private hosts and a rental company, it felt quite impersonal compared to other places we've stayed. However, in saying that, when we called (to request late check out, tell them the keypad # locked us out due to said late check out) they were professional, friendly, and very helpful. The apartment itself is beautiful with pretty much every amenity you'd ever need. Wifi was good, location is fantastic (walking distance to 6th st bars/restaurants). Parking spot was convenient. The only cons: The top floor was quite warm at night b/c it is heated by the sun during the day. Also, it seemed a little excessive to request guests to throw out trash and start a load of laundry upon check out when they charge you  $170 for a cleaning service. Overall though, we enjoyed our stay. "
,,,,,,,,"We came to stay for about 5 days in early January.  The house itself is great for a work visit because it had 2 ensuite bedroom/bathrooms.  The location is great - an easy walk from Whole Foods, some cute neighborhood
Restaurants and 6th street bars.  There some outdoor balcony space that would be nice in warmer weather too.  Overall nice  house in a
Nice location! "
,,,,,,,,"Communication prior to arrival was good - access easy. Home was well equiped and very comfortable. Unfortunately, there were only the two of us staying so the spare bedroom was not used. Kitchen was very well equiped.
"
,,,,,,,,Great & very convenient apartment!
,,,,,,,,"The place was very nicely appointed.   We were within walking distance of almost everything.  When not, Uber was a short $5.00 ride away.  We were on 6th St which made it easy to get to the restaurants and bars.   My daughter and son in law were in from NC and they really enjoyed downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Home felt very comfortable. Everything we needed was included. 
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience at this condo! There were four of us (two couples) and plenty of room! I loved having a bathroom downstairs too. The AC was ice cold, kitchen was beautiful, and the beds were comfy! There were extra towels in the upstairs closet which was helpful too. I loved having the washer and dryer in the unit as well. We spent one night cooking in, and the rest we went out to eat. It was great being able to walk everywhere downtown to eat. First thing we did was walk to whole foods and get a few groceries! Thanks for everything! "
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"We definitely got what we expected...great location, clean and comfortable accommodations.  Would have been five stars if we didn't have to check out at 10am...  Getting the group up and out after a long Saturday night was not exactly easy, but we still had a great time.  "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean and very comfortable. It's in an excellent location, a short walk to good restaurants, Whole Foods, Waterloo Records, etc. and a short drive to Barton Springs/Zilker Park and other locations of interest.  We had no contact with the owner but that was fine as we know the area well and didn't need recommendations and if someone does want that the rental agent sent an email with recommendations and there were maps and brochures in the unit. The rental agent also sent an email right after we got in checking to make sure everything was okay, which it was. I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"The communication from TurnKey prior to the booking was good. Efficient and accurate. We were booked for 5 nights. 
Access on arrival was easy - the keypad and code worked. The apartment itself was  very clean, well specified and thought had clearly gone into making guests feel at home. A very nice place to stay. 
However one serious issue arose. 
On arrival to the apartment we noticed the front door did not lock securely. The safe also did not work. This was highlighted to TurnKey later that evening on Monday. Assurances were given it would be addressed - particularly the front door which we tried to impress the concerns about. 
However what followed over the next few days was poor. 
Unreturned phone calls, no answer at the TurnKey number, no response to emails and lack of updates. In all a very poor show indeed.
The door did not lock securely until Thursday, so 3 days and nights were spent concerned for our safety over night, and concerned for our possessions when we were out of the apartment. It resulted in us changing our plans to stay more local to the apartment, and missing a number of events further afield we had organised. 
Finally we were locked out of our apartment on the day of our departure: our bags were inside the apartment and the key code no longer worked. At least we managed to get through on the phone this time (after 20 mins of holding on the phone) and gained access to the apartment in time to get to the airport. 

It should have been very simple to organise the fixing of the door within one business day - however busy they were. It was a serious safety situation and the business should have been able to deal with it. 
I am leaving this review, as the service from TurnKey needs to be highlighted. It was terrible, and a real shame for the owners of the property - who have a very nice home and clearly have put a lot of thought into the property. 
We have raised our concerns and requested a partial refund of the very high premium we paid for this apartment and the service. We will see what Air BnB decide as we have put it into their hands now. . . . 

It is a 5 star apartment, but as the review is for TurnKey and their service -  1 star.

2021663,4.5,9,9,9,9,9,9,Great little room! Very close to the city and convenient. 
,,,,,,,,"I recommend this place. Chris and Loni, although I did not meet them, seem like very genuine people. They responded in a timely manner and were very nice to us. I loved the fact that we just needed to use our codes to get in. The house was very close to everywhere we needed to go downtown! It was clean and efficient for what we paid. I would definitely stay there again. Thank you for our amazing stay in Austin â¤"
,,,,,,,,great location and well managed!
,,,,,,,,"Good place to stay, near to Austin downtown. "
,,,,,,,,Good quiet place.
,,,,,,,,"Oh my goodness STAY AWAY FROM HERE!!

I was looking to spend the night of at a BNB in Austin and i saw this place got a lot of good reviews, but I should have just gotten a hotel. This place is disgusting. The photos are accurate yes but they don't show you the terrible odor, the DIRTY linen, and the room was in the SHED of the backyard. And when I messaged the helper, he just replied ""We have professional cleaners that come everyday!"" The living rooms couch is torn up.

I did not even spend the night there, the neighborhood did NOT seem safe at all. Sitting in the car alone in the dark, a large group of people who look like theyre up to no good start walking in my direction and starts YELLING at me. It was so scary. I drove back to houston the night of but i couldn't get any of my money back which I couldn't believe. Pick somewhere else seriously."
,,,,,,,,Great communication and very close to nightlife!
,,,,,,,,"The room was very nice and it was very easy with the keyless door-system. The area was close to a lot of very cool bars, and close to downtown as well."
,,,,,,,,The location is perfect! I had a conference to attend and this location was very convenient to the Convention Center. 
,,,,,,,,Hosts were very friendly and responsive.
,,,,,,,,Good location but might not be the safest to walk back at night (if single female traveller). 
,,,,,,,,"The bad: this house is pretty run down. It's in a part of town that's gentrifying but not all the way there. There was a homeless dude who seemed to have taken up residence across the street. $110 isn't that much, but to me it was too much for this place. You can get a shared bath at the San Jose for the same price, and that hotel is swanky and right on South Congress. I'd say $60 or $70 would be more fair.

The good: all that said, its right next to downtown, which was where I needed to be. Also, it was clean. The door locks were code, so no keys involved. Most of all, the hosts (who don't appear to live in town) have responsiveness DOWN. Really easy to get a hold of. Shower works great. "
,,,,,,,,Everything was as expected. Very clean room and bathroom. Plenty of towels provided. Comfortable bed. Room #4 is the way to go.
,,,,,,,,"I wanted to give feedback on my recent stay with Airbnb.

I booked a one-night stay in Austin, TX on 10/20/2016.  

The place was advertised as a 'Chic Downtown Room.'  Unfortunately, it was anything but.  The conditions were next to deplorable.  See photos to illustrate the filth and worn out furniture.

You'll see in the photos that the room advertised is separate from the main house, so you have to go outside to gain access to the bathroom-- Not stated on Airbnb.  When we arrived, the bathroom was disgusting and had not been cleaned.  Photos will illustrate feces on the rim of the toilet and vomit on the floor.  This is unacceptable, as we were charged a cleaning fee upon exit.  In addition, the room had a lipstick kiss sealed on the wall-- a distasteful addition to this so called, 'chic' place.

I'm bringing this to your attention so you're aware, that according to my experience, this place is misrepresented on the Airbnb site.

Thanks. "
,,,,,,,,Bad experience.  Just a cheap motel room with no bathroom - or walk outside in the rain to get to the back door of the house to use the bathroom.  Bugs in room.  Strangers walking around at night in the neighborhood...seems not safe. 
,,,,,,,,"the security on the doors was very easy to handle and easy to operate. The room I stayed in does not have a hallway to the house so getting to the bathroom means stepping outside and through the back door, so i carried the lock codes with me just in case.
The room was clean but sparse and the bed was super comfortable. I didn't care for the cycling of the air conditioner as it was quite noisy through the night but needed for the heat. The neighbourhood was safe to walk through for me."
,,,,,,,,"Satisfied with this house, but did not love it. The house itself is fine - has everything basic you need. It felt a bit more like staying in a private room in a hostel than an airbnb, which depending on how you feel about hostels isn't necessarily a bad thing. The hosts were very communicative, sent me messages everyday to see if I needed anything. I would stay there again, but I would look for other options first. First off - you are not in downtown.  The area is not nice, and I did not feel safe walking around by myself to get to the bus stop or trying to walk to downtown. Second - you enter this room from the outside. Not an issue unless you have to pee in the middle of the night. But more importantly, your room is connected to room 3 by a bathroom, but you cannot use this bathroom, it is only for room 3. It was locked from our side, but we never knew if they could access our room from their side - so that was a safety concern. We also could hear them when they were in there, which was frustrating, especially when they were yelling and/or singing in the bathroom. Overall just strange (and a bit concerning) to be connected to a bathroom that you could not access. Parking was super easy, perhaps I would be more likely to stay here again if I had a car to get around. "
,,,,,,,,"The hosts were very communicative, which I appreciated. The room was completely adequate but absolutely bare-bones (no coffee for the coffee maker) nothing much in the room except the bed, etc.  The map indicates that this home is west of the highway, but it is NOT. The home is under the highway and I felt a little uncomfortable walking back in the dark having to walk through a neighborhood where homeless people were wandering around under the bridge. I was not expecting the location to be under the highway since it wasn't depicted to me like that on the website map. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying in room 4 was great. It was super close to downtown, had its own entrance, a bar fridge, and A/C that you control. Spacious and simple for one person. 

There were a couple of problems, but the hosts fixed them very quickly, the sign of a good host.

The only warnings I'd give is that the sound proofing between Room 4 and Room 3 is non existent in that you can hear them basically as if they are in the same room as you. Also, you have to go outside to get into the main house to use the bathroom, but that didn't bother me personally. "
,,,,,,,,Great small beautiful place in a great location. Everything is in a walking distance if you want to know the CBD.
,,,,,,,,"Staying here was perfect for me! It was well situated near everything I wanted to do. The room check in and check out, was very easy and stress free. Even as a shared house situation, the whole experience was very private. I highly recommend this spot for any Austin visitors"
,,,,,,,,Spacious and convenient location
,,,,,,,,Thank you for the fast response and the communication is very efficient. I hope you guys may change the AC system in that room it is too loud and prevent me from a good sleep. I woke up several times last night and was not able to get in to a deep sleep.
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay. Easy to access. Very clean. Comfortable bed. I got in late after 9 pm and was off the next day. The codes to get into the house and room made this super convenient. I have stayed at another Austin location by the same host. Both experiences were excellent.
,,,,,,,,"Overall place is fine for a location to sleep at night, but you don't deal with C&L or ever see them. The air conditioner in the room needs to be replaced, it made so much noise we couldn't sleep. The location marker is also misleading as it is not WEST of the 35 highway where its shown but EAST,  so considering people would stay here because of the proximity to Rainey and 6th st it is a shady walk under a bridge full of vagrants to get there. If a budget friendly place to rest your head is what you're looking for this is definitely an option, we just ended up paying a bit more than we would have liked as it was opening weekend for Texas football. "
,,,,,,,,"This room is at the back of the house and the only access is through yard. It uses a separated  AC unit instead of central AC. The AC unit in the room is very noisy. I woke up several times during the night. Also, There are lots of mosquitos in the room when I arrived. I got bitten and left several mosquitos bites in 10 minutes. The host came and spray something to get rid of the mosquitos in 2 hours. Their response system is good. But it left a strong smell in the room which I am allergic to. I asked them to switch room for me but they declined. Everything else is considered ok to me. "
,,,,,,,,"Had great time in Chris e Loni's place, the position is perfect, and you can use a nice kitchen and living room.
The only complain is the AC, too noisy.."
,,,,,,,,"The room looked very nice, and the bed was very comfortable. The air-conditioning unit was very loud though. I liked the privacy of the room's location, but it was inconvenient to have to walk outside to use the restroom."
,,,,,,,,"The room was great, the house was clean and stocked. It was located in a perfect spot to access downtown and the freeways. The housekeepers were really nice and helpful. My only complaint was the air-conditioner was a little loud. 

I went out at night and during t day, and never felt unsafe in the neighborhood. Great place.

I definitely think Chris and Loni have a great place and I would recommend them to anyone looking for an inexpensive place to stay while in town."
,,,,,,,,"Chris and Loni's place was great! Super convenient location, and the entire setup (access codes, parking, bedrooms/bathrooms/shared space) was really nice and easy. Perfect for anyone checking out Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Honestly, it's a great location, downtown is a 8 minute walk away, but the area is a little sketchy if you're walking back alone anytime after the sun goes down. The room is decent, fairly small, seems like a tool shed turned bedroom. There's another room adjacent to it that you can hear everything in. The AC is great but VERY loud and will probably scare the crap out of you while you're trying to sleep. Bathroom requires you to go outside and through the back of the house, so bring some sandals if you don't wanna get your feet dirty. Had a couple mice and cockroaches scuttle through the bedroom. I don't know, it's just fine for a place to crash but honestly it is nothing fancy."
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 212 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Nice and easy stay. 
,,,,,,,,I was assigned room 4 which was privately located in the back of the house. Check-in was smooth and the door codes worked just fine. The location couldn't have been better for going to the convention center. I'll keep this place in mind for next year!
,,,,,,,,"I had a very good experience in the apt. I had my privacy I expected to. 
The room was clean and well organized, so as the toilet, the kitchen and the rest of the facilities. Totally recommend, and can be feat to couples as well. "
,,,,,,,,Thanks!
,,,,,,,,This room was very comfortable with AC in the heat of Austin. The neighborhood was within short walking distance to downtown Austin. It was a great place to sleep after a long day out in Austin. I also appreciated how the hosts reached out to ask if there was anything I needed. 
,,,,,,,,"It's a good choice for a last resort but overpriced for what we got.
The room was not very clean and you had to go outside to get to the bathroom that is located in the main house.
Other than that the bed was pretty comfortable. And despite the fact that we didn't see the hosts at all they were pretty responsive on the phone.
So recommended for a last resort but not for a comfortable stay."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time to Austin and first time using AirBnB.  I felt like I was crashing at my brother's place.  Having stayed largely at hotels when I travel, this was a change to be sure.  For 1/3 what I would have paid at the conference hotel, I got a chance to experience  a bit more of Austin walking downtown each morning.  Some good things - like the Ironworks BBQ and some not as nice like; walking past and aropund the homeless camped out on the sidewalk."
,,,,,,,,"The room is adequate for a quick trip
into town. We stayed for one night and it was very convenient, close to downtown and the bed was very comfortable. Yes the bathroom is inaccessible from the room, however, it is not a big deal just a door away. I will encourage anyone to stay here for a reasonable price and a comfortable bed! "
,,,,,,,,"Well located on east downtown , it's a ""ghost"" hotel meaning you get a code to the door of your room and the apartment's and you don't ever meet the hosts. Overall, it's a good experience if nothing go wrong. But if it does, or you have an irregular request (e.g, parking..) expect miss-communication as Chris & Loni use a 3rd party service for communicating with the guests. 
"
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I had a great stay at Chris and Loni's house.  Comfy bed, cold AC, personal fridge, very close to convention center and downtown.  Door code system worked great.  We did end up having to park a little down the street as there was really only room in the driveway for one car and only room for one other car in front of the house.  We were in room 4 which did not have a private bathroom, though the bathroom we shared was nice despite being small.  Kitchen was great with plenty of silverware, plates, water filter, stove, microwave, etc.  Overall we were very pleased with our stay and would likely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,The text message with directions to the room were good and I was able to book on short notice with no problems.
,,,,,,,,"Chris and Loni's place did the job as a place to sleep while I was attending a conference at the Austin conference center. The best features are its proximity to the conference center and the bars/restaurants nearby and the supremely comfortable bed! I was staying in room 4, which is attached on to the back of the house. I know others didn't like that room 4 has a separate entrance but it didn't bother me (in fact it made it feel less hostel like). The minuses were that you could clearly hear conversation, the water running etc. in the bathroom on the other side of the wall. If I hadn't been using this place as just a place to sleep it would have got to me. That said, as a base in a great location, it's great value."
,,,,,,,,The location was not quite where it originally showed on the map which was a little bit upsetting because that was the main reason we chose this place but luckily it was only a few blocks off. The room was very clean and safe. I didn't have to converse with anyone. Everything was settled via Airbnb and all I had to do was walk in and sleep. They even left towels on the bed for us! Lovely place. 10/10 would recommend to a friend 
,,,,,,,,"I did not see Chris and Loni when I stayed, but they were quick to reply to my messages. I stayed in room 4, so it was very private and felt safe because of the number lock on the door. However, visiting the bathroom was a bit of a hassle because I had to remember two door codes to get in and out of the house every time. Keep in mind this is a good stop-over place and is convenient and clean, but it does not feel like a home, more like a hostel.
Location was pretty convenient for Austin downtown."
,,,,,,,,"This place is convenient, it is only 5 minutes walk from Austin Conference Center, on the other side of the highway.  The neighborhood is quiet, but watch out where you cross under the highway, the parking lot has lots of homeless people at night.

The house is pretty good.  The host does not live there, it has 4 rooms (each with individual lock on the door) and 2 bathrooms.  It has full kitchen and fridge, so you can prepare your meals.  

The entrance to my room (#4) is actually outside of the house, I have go thru the backyard and to enter.  It's both good and bad.  Good is quieter at night, bad is I have to remember the code if I have to go to bathroom."
,,,,,,,,I stayed in one of the 4 rooms that are available in the house.  There is good access to the kitchen and living room too.  The room is quiet and the bed very comfortable.  This is on a nice quiet street in an area of homes that is essentially a few blocks from the high end Downtown Hotels and shopping.  It is a very easy walk taking the 4th street bike/walking path.  I went everywhere by Austin B-cycle near their place.  I highly recommend this place for visiting Downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,"I did not see Chris and Loni when I stayed, but they were quick to reply to my messages. I stayed in room 4, so it was very private and felt safe because of the number lock on the door. However, visiting the bathroom was a bit of a hassle because I had to remember two door codes to get in and out of the house everytime. Keep in mind this is a good stop-over place and is convenient and clean, but it does not feel like a home, more like a hostel. Which is totally fine! And the instant book option was really nice, considering the time crunnch window in which I had to book this room."
,,,,,,,,Everything with my stay went really well. Everything was as described and the directions given by the host were clear and concise. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,Great location. The hosts were very responsive and always checking on me to make sure I was having a good time or if I needed something. Definitely recommend them.
,,,,,,,,We stayed here for an even at the Austin Convention Center. House and room were both very clean and in a convenient location. All questions we had were quickly answered via the AirBnb app. Community bathroom was clean and shower had good pressure.
,,,,,,,,"Overall, the house is in a convenient location and does the job. We stayed in Room 4 for two nights and Room 3 for one night and definitely preferred Room 3. Room 4 is attached to the house, but only accessible by going outside. We didn't think this was an issue, until you have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Long story short, it's a good deal on budget."
,,,,,,,,"Bed was comfortable and house was within walking distance of everything that I wanted and hoped for. Some bug issues and a leaky ceiling in the laundry room were discovered on the last day of the stay, but were promised to be remedied. 

Be advised, there's a door to a connected bathroom so if you're sleeping and someone in another room in the house uses that bathroom you may be woken up. "
,,,,,,,,"The location of the house was fantastic. Easy walk to bars to the east, as well as the convention ctr and downtown bars/bat bridge. The house is clean and well appointed. Room 4 is out the back and attached to room 3's private bath (the door locks). There is noise from the rm 3 bathroom, but if they close the door to their room it is not too bad. Going outside to get to the shared bath in the main house is annoying in the rain, but the room definitely has more privacy. Good stay over all, would be great with a group."
,,,,,,,,"Clean and quiet.  Easy walking distance from nice old neighborhood to downtown.  Shared bathroom, but that was fine.   Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"The codes worked, the room and common facilities were spacious and clean. I saw no one else during my first, two-day stay here, and that was just fine. This would be the start of a very good review, if it were not for what happened and the way I was treated during my second, one-day stay a few days later."
,,,,,,,,"The room is as large and clean and private as advertised. It was a very short...like a few seconds...walk out the back of the main section, but I actually liked that. It felt exclusive.

I didnâ€™t spend any real time in the main section of the house, but it was also large, clean and well-equipped.

Bathroom (especially the shower) was great. Big, clean, separate from the rest of the house.

The automated nature of this operation blew up a bit in my (and the hostâ€™s) faces. I couldnâ€™t get in touch with anyone when I needed to, and then went through a tough few messages back and forth, after the fact, trying to resolve the issue.

I faced more resistance than I had thought I would and am, in the end, satisfied-ish, but tired of dealing with it.

With a little better, faster customer service (and starting with giving the customer the benefit of the doubt about issues), I think this could easily be a consistently great place to stay.

P.S. The issues all stemmed from my second stay here, 2 days after my first. After just the first stay, I was right ready to give a five-star review."
,,,,,,,,"FYI the walls between rooms 3 & 4 keep out no sound, so if you have people staying in the other room, you will hear everything they say. 

However, the location and parking were quite good. No interaction with host, but Guesty was useful to us when we had questions. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was great. It was a good location, nice and clean. I enjoyed my stay."
,,,,,,,,"Very convenient location. 5 min walk from downtown Austin. Our room was very clean, cozy and private, and no noise, so we had a great sleep there :). There is a coffee shop two blocks away (by the book store), which was very convenient for morning coffee."
,,,,,,,,It was nice and close to downtown! I went during SXSW and you felt like you never left the scene. The only thing is room #3 have access to your room.. So that can make you a bit uncomfortable but besides that it was quick in and out. 
,,,,,,,,"Julia is a great host with excellent communication skills. Her home is centrally located to downtown area, less than 10 minutes walk. The room is exactly as pictured with convenient access by keypad and very comfortable bed. I would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Julia's place was a great fit for my needs: private, conveniently located, and comfortable.  I didn't interact with the hosts directly at all -- bookings are managed by a third party -- but check-in arrangements were very smooth and easy.  "
,,,,,,,,Great! Very convenient!
,,,,,,,,"House was in great shape very clean, was able to come and go whenever I would like it was very nice"
,,,,,,,,Great experience! Easy and convenient entry/exit. Clean room. Great area.
,,,,,,,,"This is place was exactly what I needed - simple, clean, private and at a very convenient location. The hosts were very considerate and responsive. It has been a great pleasure staying here."
,,,,,,,,"My stay at Julia's was peaceful, convenient and comfortable. Room 4 has a very comfortable bed, and since its in the back of the house, it enjoys extra privacy and quiet. The house is kept very clean.  Location is great, ample parking on street and, lots of restaurants within walking distance. I would be happy to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Never saw host. No instructions at all. Could use some friendly what to expect of us and from you.  But would stay again.   Overall good experience.
,,,,,,,,The apartment was as advertised - comfortable and clean and in a great location.  
,,,,,,,,"Great little place, very comfy bed, and a nice house! well located with secure entry, and comprehensive instructions from the host. easy parking as well."
,,,,,,,,My room was ready and clean for my arrival. I felt everything was as described in the listing. It was only a few blocks from the convention center. It was a much more affordable option for spending a week downtown. 
,,,,,,,,I was really happy with my experience at Julia's place. All of the check in instructions were clear and the room was perfectly set up waiting for me. No hassle at all and very close to downtown. Was the perfect location for going out on foot or by car.
,,,,,,,,Great place. Easy to access. Clean and perfect location for downtown. Lots of coffee shops and restaurants in the area   and easy parking on the street. Great place.
,,,,,,,,"Super cozy! Loved how close it was to work for me, I work DT. I also loved that I didn't have to pay to park my car on the street overnight....huge plus for an Austinite like myself that has to pay for overnight parking at most places. Walls are thin, but still slept peacefully. Definitely recommend it! "
,,,,,,,,"Check in and check out was easy,  the location was great, there was space heater, the place was relatively clean and the bed was comfy. 

Staying in room 4 however means you have to go outside to access the bathroom even though there is a bathroom connected to the room. So even though you have no access to the bathroom adjoining the room,  you are still able to clearly hear people going to the bathroom and showering. The house is advertised as having 3 bathrooms when in reality only room 3 has access to the third bathroom. 

The room is accessed through a key code and on our second morning someone came into our room using the code, so I would recommend locking any bags you have when you are not in the room. 

Essentially, when staying in this room you are paying for the location. If I were to visit Austin again I would probably pay extra to stay somewhere else with a comparable location but access to a bathroom."
,,,,,,,,"The room was excellent, clean and comfortable. Although walking outside to go to the bathroom wasn't ideal, the mild Austin weather didn't make it too much of burden. I interacted with Jordan a bit (never met Julia). He was very friendly and provided good recommendations for local places. The location, however, is the best feature with easy access to several Austin hotspots including 6th Street, Rainey Street, and East 6th/E Cesar. If I went back to Austin , I would consider staying again."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent and just as described. Very much an ""automated hostel"" feel, but was perfect for my need to find a place to crash for a night."
,,,,,,,,"This is a comfortable and convenient room in East Austin and I really liked staying here. You have a lot of privacy, and the keyless entry made checking in and out super easy because you can come and go as you please. The room was clean, had a mini-fridge, a space heater, and the bed was super soft. You can easily walk to the main streets in East Austin and the downtown area. There are also bike share stations near by which was great."
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful time in Austin. The location is perfect and right next to down town.
,,,,,,,,The room was good and close to downtown attractions which was nice. I did think it was a bit pricey considering that you had to walk outside and go into the house to use the bathroom and there were no working tvs in the house. All in all it worked out for what we needed but I will likely stay elsewhere if I come back to stay in Austin. Julia and her staff were pretty quick to respond to any inquiries and everything was pretty clean.
,,,,,,,,"Convenient location and very easy stay. The bathroom is not connected to the room and you have to walk a few steps outside to get into the main house to use the bathroom.  It is not as bad as it sounds. I did not talk to anyone in the house, but Julia made any questions/concerns very clear and got back to me quickly. I would definitely stay again when I am back to visit. "
,,,,,,,,"It was a very last minute decision to stay with Julia, but everything was still arranged smoothly and professionally."
,,,,,,,,"Remarkable multi-room house on autopilot. Useful location within easy walking distance of 6th St and Caesar Chavez St.

NB: No one actually lives there, and I never met Julia. If youâ€™re looking for the feeling of a small modern automated hostel, this is a great spot. If you need any hand holding, it might not be the place for you."
,,,,,,,,Stayed in a small room out back without attached bathroom. Location was very close to downtown. Easy access with door codes. Other guests were nice. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay, rexomended 100%"
,,,,,,,,Great room in a quiet house.  Spent one night there and did not run into any other travelers.  It was the perfect place for me.  Also located near great food and nightlife options.  Would definitely recommend...
,,,,,,,,It was a nice stay. The room is quiet and people are friendly. The house is quite near downtown and the convention center. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location in Austin! And super easy access. Bathroom was also easily accessible, high speed WiFi, and super private room. "
,,,,,,,,"Wow, great 1st Airbnb experience! Everything was very clean and tidy. The room's entrance is on the exterior of the house in the backyard, making it feel very private. The bathroom is roomy and I loved the walk-in shower. The host and guests were friendly and welcoming. Location is optimal -- short walk to cafes, restaurants, and nightlife and convenient to the highway (quick trip to the airport). The nighttime noise level was lower than what I expected for the location. If I return to Austin I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Room is big and the main house has all the anemities you need. Checkin was a breeze and Jordan and Julia were super helpful. I liked it so much, I stayed here again when I had to leave another terrible airbnb in Austin. Location is great - next to Rainey and East 6th street, the best part of Austin IMO.

Guests should understand this place is a travel house and you will need to walk outside use the bathroom. This room also had some weirds quirks - there were 2 mattresses on top of a box spring, which made the bed an awkward height. Also, there is a locked private bathroom adjoining this room that you cannot have access to, but you will still hear other guests showering etc. if you are a light sleeper. 

But overall, it was a good experience and an good value."
,,,,,,,,"The location was very good, the access to the house was easy and parking was easy to find as well. 
On the other hand, I think the price was too high for what it was worth.  I did not like the room that much, because it does not look quiet the same as the picture, for some reason they had 2 mattresses on top the the bed base so it made bed too high so that made uncomfortable.  
Also, the room it not inside of the house, it's like an attachment in the back of the house, so in order to go to the bathroom you need to go out to the patio then enter the house, the problem was that it was raining a lot, so every time I needed to go to the bathroom I've soaking wet.
I never quiet understood if the people in the house were either the owners or other guests, because no one greeted us or welcomed us to the house.
I've had great experiences with Airbnb before, but this time I was not very please."
,,,,,,,,I felt completely home and the room was exactly was I am expecting. Jordan and Julie were very warm and nice during my period there. I really recommend their place and will be there again next year.
,,,,,,,,"Great room, simple and to the point.  Great value for staying so close to dt Austin, would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Quiet, close to downtown, and cheap. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"I found the room to be just as described, nothing fancy but a clean, comfortable room and bed to sleep in after a day of travel.  I loved the privacy and heard no noises from the main part of the house.  I didn't even mind walking the few steps outside between the bedroom and the main house to potty (even in the middle of the nite -- no biggie).  The keyless lock worked great -- no key to deal with.  My only criticism was the noisy A/C window unit -- it clicked on and off way too frequently and I found it annoying while trying to fall asleep.  But I'm sure I would've had a much harder time falling asleep without any A/C at all!  The temp was great, just the constant on/off irritating.  Other than that, a great experience and I would definitely come back."
,,,,,,,,"This room was perfect for our downtown stay in Austin. Just a few blocks away from the B-cycle Share station, We were able to ride about the town with ease.  The room was comfortable and clean; also the entry was smooth and effortless. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,Julia was helpful and accommodating following up to and throughout the trip. The room and bathroom were clean and spacious. Would recommend especially if you're staying in Austin for a few days. 
,,,,,,,,"Everything was as described, keyless entry eliminated the worry of key exchanges. Very good experience. "
,,,,,,,,"The building was easy to get in and out of, our room had air conditioning and was very comfortable in the heat. Bathrooms were cleaned whilst we were there, the rest of the house was mostly clean as well. Location was excellent! Lots of amazing places a close walk away, and we walked back to the room late at night with no issues. Would highly recommend, and would revisit if back in Austin again. "
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I had a great stay at Julia's Airbnb. The house is located only about a mile from downtown Austin, and has some amazing barbecue/coffee/tacos/brunch all within walking distance in East Austin. 

We stayed in room #4, the space was very clean, bed was comfortable and a great spot have as a home base. One thing we didn't realize was that the room was slightly removed from the house so we needed to walk outside (only about 20 ft) back to the house to use the bathroom. 

We had a great stay and would definitely recommend to any friends who wanted to explore the city!"
,,,,,,,,"Good stay, good host, super communicative. 

The place has a bit of a hostel feel, but I liked that. No check-in's, everything was automated. The place was super close and convenient. "
,,,,,,,,Great experience. Felt like my own little place with a shared bathroom in the other part of the house. Good location and overall chill experience. Recommend her place if you are in the area. 
,,,,,,,,"Rented a room from Julie on the way to Austin for a last minute get away. Had absolutely no hassle. Clean, orderly, and great place! Easy walk to Rainey St and 6th St, as well as Lady Bird Lake. Highly recommend and would rent this room again."
,,,,,,,,"I didn't have any interactions with Julia personally, but did have pleasant interactions with the on site host (my apologies for forgetting your name).  Overall I feel that the price was somewhat higher than I would expect for the neighborhood (somewhat depressed, and an industrial area a block away) and accommodations (basic), but I was satisfied with the experience.    I agree with some of the other reviews that it has more of a hostel feel, which I didn't have an issue with.  The common area was fine, and I had a bathroom to myself, as far as I could tell.  You do have to walk through a small private courtyard to enter the main house in order to use the bathroom, which was a minor inconvenience.  I was at a conference at the convention center, and while it was a short walk (less than 10 minutes), it was somewhat sketchy, and I don't think I would have been comfortable walking it at night as a single woman (I'm male).  It is really much better set up for people with a car, where this wouldn't be an issue, but I didn't have one.  There is a good coffee shop to the north, across the light rail tracks, and up on 6th (3 blocks) there is an awesome and cheap Mexican food truck that has great breakfast tacos.  There are also some food trucks close by, including La Barbecue, with phenomenal BBQ and also REALLY long lines.  They have free beer and a band at lunch on the weekends, but expect a 2+ hour wait, or order ahead at least 4 days in advance and skip the lines (worth it!).  "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was well automated, while it may be a little weird to rent a place with no host, I was fine with it, I would rent it again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, cosy room and great communication throughout. Highly recommended "
,,,,,,,,"The room and house was very clean and in a great location for my needs. My only issue is that my room (#4) is actually outside of the house, so you have to walk outside to go to bathroom, use the kitchen, etc. I did not know this before booking the room and since I was traveling alone and coming in late at night after a work event, this made me a bit nervous. If I had known this ahead of time I would have booked a different room in the house that was inside. Loved the keyless entry. "
,,,,,,,,"La habitaciÃ³n es muy cÃ³moda, limpia, tranquila. Con todo lo bÃ¡sico. La casa estÃ¡ totalmente equipada. Lo tiene todo. Es ideal para una estadÃ­a larga. "
,,,,,,,,I loved Austin and the room was very close to downtown which was perfect. I could walk there within 10min. The room was nice and comfortable. I would stay there again :)
,,,,,,,,"Soggiorno veramente ""strano"".. di Julia manco l'ombra, nÃ¨ di nessun altro. Codici per entrare e uscire dalla stanza ed assoluta libertÃ . Siamo rimasti un po' stupiti, anche perchÃ© ci arrivavano messaggi in ""automatico"" da Julia senza senso tipo ""spero vi siate trovati bene, vi ricordo domani mattina di lasciare la stanza presto"".. ma in realtÃ , non eravamo neanche arrivati al B&B!! Stanza comunque pulita, 1 solo asciugamano fornito, la scomoditÃ  era che la stanza era ""distaccata"" dal resto della casa e quindi dal bagno. Per raggiungerlo bisognava uscire dalla stanza, attraversare il cortile, digitare il codice, entrare in casa ed arrivare finalmente al bagno..  un tantino scomodo. Si salva la posizione strategica ed il vicinato tranquillo. "
,,,,,,,,Got directions to eveywhere we needed to go had a great experience. Had a construction crew wake us up super early the first night but emailed them about it and postponed construction the next morning until 10 to allow us to get some sleep. Although we had this initial problem they were so quick to get it fixed for us and had no issues after quiet area had a blast
,,,,,,,,"Had a great first AirBNB experience. It was more of a hostel style, with communal areas, but each had their own private room with a specific code for the door.  Instructions were provided in messages, so it was nice to not need any orientation or deal with keys. Room was clean and comfortable, had it's own AC unit, and all in all great. I liked that I could leave some extra food/drink behind in the communal fridge so other patrons could use them. No waste!"
,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately, I had a emergency, had to go home and wasn't able to stay in the room.  "
,,,,,,,,Everything listed was accurate and we had no problems getting in at any point. For the little time we were there it was pleasant.
,,,,,,,,"Pros
-Quiet
-Clean
Cons
- bathroom inside the house
-Price/value"
,,,,,,,,"Very nice and clean place, good for staying one or some more nights "
,,,,,,,,"My 1st ever airbnb experience was perfect. I landed at 1030 on was able to get into my room quick and easy. Stepped out on the town and had the same easy access at the end of the night. Chic and cozy it def is and fit my needs to a ""T"". Thanks Julia and the community people there my night to make it an awesome experience.  Cheers!"
,,,,,,,,"Starting with the positives the space is very clean and in a great location. The bed was comfortable and we had towels and everything we needed. On the negative side the bathroom is inside the main house where we had to go through the courtyard to access it. There is a bathroom attached to our room but it was blocked off for the owners to use for themselves. This was quite an inconvenience in the night, mainly as it let in lots of mosquitos and we got really heavily bitten. There was no real communication before we arrived as it was an instant book but it would have been nice to get a welcome message. When we got there we spoke to Jordan who helped us with where we had to go but when we had other questions after we did get the feeling we were inconveniencing him as he was working. We had to find our own way around the town as had no information about where to go etc. when we got back in the evening we met Julie who offered us information but we had already found it all out ourselves. Julie was very friendly. Our main issue was that the door to our room didn't lock at all as there was a problem with the code. As this opened outside we didn't feel comfortable with this as anyone could have walked in from outside, or another guest. It turned out there were no other guests staying but if this was the case we could have been moved into one of the other rooms. Another person offered to fix the lock while we went into town but when we got back it was still unlocked, and when we asked about it they said he would be back soon and would come in. We asked Julie about this a third time and were reassured he would be coming but never did. We didn't feel 100% safe while we were sleeping even though we were assured it was a safe neighbourhood. Overall we didn't feel this was the usual airbnb experience we were used to as it had a real business feel to the set up. If you just need a clean room with good location then this is great but if you want to have a more personal experience then I would advise looking for somewhere else. "
,,,,,,,,"This stay was everything I wanted-- great price, convenient and clean-- with an emphasis on all three.  Some reviewers say it has a hostel feel with other guests they don't know there, but I would say this is better than that-- with much more privacy and sophistication but the same simple necessities and independence for vagabond travelers. The 24 hour check in service is a dream for travelers like me with changing plans and client needs. Will stay again."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in this place. 
It's closer to an hostel than the previous airbnb I've been but the stay was perfect. 
Met some other travelers and had a blast in the city. 

You can walk to downtown and there is a wonderful coffee just one block away. 
Also lot of parking space in the street. 
So if you're not afraid to share the bathroom with other guest you should definitely book. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in this place. 
It is close to downtown, you can walk there in 10 minutes. 
If you are fine to share bathrooms with other guests you should definitely book. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a perfect place for my first time in Austin. In a great location, just a short walk to downtown. Even better if you have a bike to explore with. Checking in and out was hassle free and easy and i felt safe and secure. Would stay again!   "
,,,,,,,,"This airbnb was more like a luxury hostel, in many ways, with shared bathrooms, a shared kitchen and lounge area between several bedrooms housing the guests. That being said, it was a very pleasant experience staying here; the room was basic but very clean and comfortable and with great air conditionin. The kitchen and lounge area were also well decorated and well equipped. We didn't get to meet Julia, but her communication was great and the gentleman who welcomed us in her place was friendly and welcoming. "
,,,,,,,,"Julia's room downtown is fantastic! Just as advertised, clean, comfy and a quick walk to downtown Austin. The room itself is very private, and it's attached to a main house with a great sitting room that has binders full of info for places to go in Austin. Also a quick walk to Rainey street which is full of old houses converted into bars and restaurants. Overall a great experience. "
,,,,,,,,The key code setup was very convenient and allowed me come in and out as I pleased without worrying that I would disturb anyone.  The living room and bedroom was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The hosts were very friendly and even took me out on a bike ride to check out Austin.  Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"The stay was great, thanks so much! Everyone was accommodating, and the location is a stone's throw away from the bus stop. Short walk to all the fun you can find! Glad I stayed here, room was exactly what I hoped for and I was not disappointed in the least."
,,,,,,,,"Great, simple set up. Very easy and convenient for hanging out downtown."
,,,,,,,,"I had a very positive experience. 

The location is close to downtown, and has a cool cafe, Cenote, close by. The room was clean and quiet, the hosts friendly.

There was a bit of a glitch as some of the information (phone numbers, keys) had changed between when I booked and the time I showed up. The hosts were present on site and took care of it. "
,,,,,,,,Nice clean room. Easy access and close to all the Austin fun. Will stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Neighborhood was nice and convenient for getting around to HH spots, nightlife, restos, etc.  The information for what to expect when we arrive was descriptive, accurate and helpful when we arrived.  Overall our stay was everything we could've asked for and lived up to expectations!"
,,,,,,,,"The house is on a quiet street around 10-15 minutes walk from downtown Austin. The living room and kitchen are nice, although I didn't actually cook in the latter.

The bedroom is small and contains nothing except a bed and a small fridge. The air conditioning is *extremely* loud and kicks in every minute or two - I had to shut it down completely in order to sleep. The room I stayed in is actually separate from the main house, which means you need to go outside to get to the bathroom. There was some sort of connecting door to the next bedroom and its ensuite, which I couldn't lock. The neighbour decided to play loud music in the bathroom at 6:30am."
,,,,,,,,Julia's place was the perfect fit for our needs.  My girlfriend and I were in Austin for only 1 night and this place was not only affordable but only a $4 uber ride away from DT Austin.  Great for guests just passing through Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location, the check-in/check-out process was seamless. Great location if you are planning to stay/work/play in the downtown area. The only issue I had was I had to walk outside to go to the bathroom, so as long as you don't mind that, this was a great value for the location."
,,,,,,,,"This was a bit more like a hotel/hostel experience than other airbnb experiences I've had. I think Julia was out of town so I think there was a staff member overseeing the rooms and lots of guests for the holiday weekend. 

It was a little weird that you had to travel outside to get to the bathroom (which was a little rough during the crazy weather this past weekend) but still a nice place overall with a cozy mattress, clean bathroom, and fresh towels. "
,,,,,,,,Overall our first airbnb experience was very smooth. The house was very conveniently located and easy to access!
,,,,,,,,"We loved this house. It was an easy walk into the heart of downtown. The room was small, but very comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"I had an adequate experience, and the room was in close proximity to the Convention Center and various East Austin eateries, bars and venues. The place is more of a ""hostel"" than I was expecting, with six rooms in a house totally converted and no one seeming to live there. Cleanliness of the shared bathroom space was so-so, which makes sense given how many people are staying there. I never saw any of the hosts during my stay. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay in Austin!  It was right near everything we wanted to do.  A short walk Downtown and steps away from Rainey street which is an awesome place for night life.  The room was clean and so was the rest of the house.  All of the needed amenities were available and we never had a mishap.  Smooth sailing! If you are looking for a place to stay in Austin and you are not expecting to be home for much of the trip, this is your absolute best bet.  My girlfriend and I had a blast! Thanks Julia"
,,,,,,,,Ok
,,,,,,,,"Even though I did not get to meet Julia she was a fantastic host, great communication and great room with comfy bed close to downtown. Fully recommend staying with her."
,,,,,,,,Place was clean. Enjoyed my stay. 
,,,,,,,,"Communicating with Julia was a breeze, I had a great time staying at her place and the room was comfortable and clean. The area was awesome with it being close to the airport, downtown Austin, and 6th street."
,,,,,,,,"Just a simple, no-frills room with shared bathroom very close to downtown austin."
,,,,,,,,"The room was clean and attractive as were the common spaces. I had a room on a back courtyard which was somewhat less convenient to the bathroom.  The host provided the access codes to the front door and to the room by email, so we never actually met.    

I was attending a conference in downtown Austin which was within walking distance.  Also close by are the restaurants and bars on E 6th Street and, in the other direction, the nightlife on Rainey St was about a ten minute walk. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Julia's over Easter weekend was great! Amazing location, a quick walk to 6th St. And pretty much any downtown area you want to go. Only about a 10 minute uber ride from the airport. Meeting the other people renting rooms was a neat experience. Cost is great for the location! Never met Julia but she was very responsive and helpful before, during, and after the renting process. 5/5 stars"
,,,,,,,,Great location.
,,,,,,,,"Julia was very accommodating and easy to communicate with, even though we didn't meet in person. The room I stayed in was located outside of the main house which meant it was really cold at night and you had to walk through the backyard to use the bathroom in the main house. If you don't mind a cold room/outdoor trek to the bathroom, then otherwise this place is in a great location. I could easily walk to where I needed to go. "
,,,,,,,,"I didn't need to check in with anyone and the directions to access the home and room were straightforward. Very easy. The house was impeccable and looks newly remodeled. Everything was very clean and neat. Spacious rooms, nice big kitchen and the bathrooms were nice as well. My room (#4) didn't have a full length mirror or a mirror for me to do my hair or makeup which I think would help ease up the bathrooms a bit but overall I was very happy with my stay here. The bathrooms were stocked with toilet paper, toiletries and washcloths.  My room had two towels and clean sheets. I was very happy to have a small space heater in my room as well. I only used it the first two nights but it warmed the room up nicely. I stayed here to attend a conference going on at the Austin Convention Center. It was about an 8 minute walk in the morning. Very close and I would definitely recommend this house to anyone looking to stay near downtown Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Overall great stay. Room small,clean,perfect location. Was as described. Housemates were great. Would def use again. Ads can be confusing. Some rooms inside house, some outside detached. Be sure to contact for layout information if this matters to you (detached probably more quiet, but inside easier to restroom)."
,,,,,,,,"I visited Austin to see a show on 6th St. I was looking for a relatively inexpensive place within walking distance of the show. This place met my criteria quite well.

Positives: 
1. the transaction was very smooth. I booked the room the day before check in, received comprehensive instructions by email.
2. plentiful street parking.
3. the room was clean, towels and adequate bedding were provided.
4. the location is a short walk from 6th St, which meant I didn't have to worry about finding parking before the show or driving back afterwards.

Negatives: 
1. there are only two bathrooms shared between eight double rooms.  Both bathrooms were in use when I got up. Frowny face.
2. there is no central air and no window unit. There is a silly little heater which plugs into the wall. I was comfortable enough in February but I don't think I'd want to have to sleep in this room anytime between May and September.
3. my room, #4, shares a bathroom with room #3. The door was locked from the other side but there was no way to secure the door on my side. Also the dividing wall is pretty thin. Frowny face.
4. the neighborhood is best described as ""mixed use"". Many people might not feel comfortable walking around alone at night."
,,,,,,,,"Once I get settled, the location was great for a Crossfit box, the convention center and 6th street.  I was not expecting to have to go outside to use the bathroom, but it worked just fine. "
,,,,,,,,"There are several rooms on the property. I stayed in room #4 for one night. The room is small yet efficient. My room was clean, had a comfortable bed, a mini fridge, a small closet with hangers, a night stand with a lamp, an area heater (which was definitely needed at night), and a couple bath towels. The bathroom is inside the main house. So from room #4 you have to walk a couple feet outside to get to it. I had no issue with this as the weather was agreeable. The location was convenient and the neighborhood calm. It took me about a minute to walk up to the Shangri La bar on 6th street. And about 5 minutes to walk into downtown Austin for coffee and breakfast in the morning. I enjoyed the fact that there were others staying there and I got to kick it with some interesting and good people. In my opinion, a big bonus was the keyless entry locks. No keys to worry with, and probably a bit more secure."
,,,,,,,,"The place is super clean! Sarah and. Julia were very responsive, always available by phone. Great place to stay. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect spot. super comfortable bed and room. great bathroom. super friendly host. would stay hear again without any hesitation.
,,,,,,,,Julia's place was clean and peaceful. We booked the room late but she responded immediately and was super pleasant. I would suggest it for a cheap short stay anytime!
,,,,,,,,This was an awesome place to stay! The room furniture was bare minimum but totally fit our needs. Good kitchen with appliances. 
,,,,,,,,"GREAT East Austin location, Julia & Co. were fast and effective communicators and went out of their way to make me feel welcome.  Room was basic but good for the price.

I will say that the room I got was not as pictured (it had less furniture, but more windows and its own entrance).  I had told Julia a bit about my trip and what I got was actually a better match.  I'd suggest if you stay at her place you discuss beforehand as well.  I'd definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"We had a mixed experience staying at Julia's. When we arrived, it was clear that the house was undergoing a major renovation that we didn't expect; the kitchen didn't have countertops, the bedroom was missing blinds on one window, our room did not have heat, the door to the (shared) bathroom didn't close, and construction materials were laying all about the inside and outside of the house. And our room did not have a desk, lamp or dresser pictured in the listing.

That said, Sara was extremely helpful in getting us what we needed. The room that we shared a bathroom with was unoccupied for most of our stay so the door that wouldn't shut was less of an issue, though it would still have been nice to have some privacy in our own room. We were offered to have blinds installed during our stay, which we politely declined. Sara provided a heater as soon as we let her know we needed one, and her response time was remarkable.

Unfortunately all of Sara's help couldn't erase the feeling that we were staying in a construction site. Our stay may have been better if we had been able to anticipate the ongoing construction. Once it's done and all the kinks are out, I'm sure it will be a comfortable place to stay."
,,,,,,,,"Room was lacking a cover of any kind over the window and there was no chair.  Entire facility was still very much under renovation but the room was fine and the location was OK.  I felt entirely safe even though I was probably the only renter one or two nights.  I did meet one of the hosts, Sarah, and she was very pleasant.  "
,,,,,,,,"Julia was extremely helpful and was waiting for me at the door when I arrived. There was a slight issue with the room I booked, but she had already arranged a fix to a bigger and better room! This was my very first Air BnB and I had an excellent first experience. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a good experience. The home is clean, spacious and close to a lot of the sights. I did not meet Julia but she responded promptly to all my questions via text. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"The Host was out of town for the 4 days I've stayed, so I could not get the chance to meet her. The room was small with little room to walk around in, but had a comfortable bed to make up for it. I wasn't to pleased with the neighborhood as it had graffiti on the alleys, a lot of homeless people in the vicinity, and the curb view of the neighborhood was not kept nicely."
,,,,,,,,"Enjoyed my stay here! The room was decent size and the bed was comfortable. The location was really good, especially for the price. I was here for the Formula 1 race so it was perfect location for access to the highways. The host was nice. The only downside was having the bathroom in the other house but even that wasn't as inconvenient as I was expecting. Having a mirror would have been nice so I didn't have to go to the other house just to put make up on or use a mirror. Overall good experience, thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Conveniently located with access to downtown Austin. Peaceful neighbourhood. 
,,,,,,,,The house was rundown and the neighbourhood was unsafe. Having the outside room with a indoor toilet was a massive negative. 
,,,,,,,,There was a little construction going on during my visit but overall my experience was good. The room is lovely and the hosts were very friendly. 
,,,,,,,,Julia did an excellent job of making me feel welcome by wonderful amenities and a great room. I had no trouble checking in or out. I almost felt like it never happened! I would highly recommend Julia and her Private East Austin Room.
,,,,,,,,"I did not really see the host, but it was a quiet neighborhood and a private room. The only thing I had known was that the bathroom was not located in the bedroom, but rather in another house. Aside from that, it was cozy."
,,,,,,,,"So, it's 1:38am and I am awake. Expect this at this house and have fun. "
,,,,,,,,"Just what I expected , simple and comfortable carriage house , good bed and with AC , location is great in terms of proximity to downtown , but the area going from and to is a bit sketchy at night , homeless people tend to congregate there , I learned my lesson the first night and from that moment on I used uber and taxies , and then everything was great"
,,,,,,,,"Julia was very welcoming and responsive. The bedroom space was small but clean and well-kept, as was the bathroom. Location was great. Far enough away that parking was not a problem, but an easy 15ish minute walk to entertainment, shopping and restaurants. Thank you!!"
,,,,,,,,Great location. Clean room. Only negative was the bathroom was inside the house and the bedroom was detached. Ended up waiting for the bathroom a few times. Enjoyed my trip. Great response time from Julia  
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect! 
,,,,,,,,"It was easy to come and go from Room 3 - lots of privacy, air con, pretty central for walking and cabs. 

The only issue was that, since Rm 3 is outside the main house, the bathroom was sometimes a bit of a mission, and sometimes there was a wait since the house was full. 

Clean sheets, kitchen access... Overall a good experience. Thanks Jordan!"
,,,,,,,,"excellent location in east austin. the room was clean and comfortable. easy walk to both downtown austin and restaurants/nightlife in east austin - would recommend to friends! thanks julia!
"
,,,,,,,,Nice neighborhood
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Julia's place was great. Julia was out of town but Jordan and Sara were super helpful with everything, with pro tips on what to do (and eat!) around Austin. The location is great, with tasty food  2 minutes away. I stayed in the separate room out back, which had aircon (and is much needed for Austin's scorching summers) and was cosy. 

I highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a good stray, however never had a chance to meet my host."
,,,,,,,,Siamo stati 3 notti nella carriage house room 3. Julia Ã¨ stata disponibile via mail. Per entrare in camera e nella casa dove c'Ã¨ il bagno ci Ã¨ stato inviato un codice il giorno prima dell'arrivo. Nei 3 giorni non abbiamo incontrato nessuno ma non ci sono stati problemi. Il quartiere Ã¨ tranquillo e la posizione comoda per raggiungere il centro e la 6th strada. L'aria condizionata era un pÃ² rumorosa ma fondamentale per l'estate di Austin.
,,,,,,,,"In general, I have good experience staying at that place. I had a professional conference in Austin convention center. This place is close to the meeting place within walk distance. The biggest concern to me is walking in the evening around the neighborhood. After I had dinner with my friends after meeting, I notice that some street light were broken and a couple of homeless people were around the neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,My experience was a good one.  If I had questions they were quickly responded to in a very friendly and welcoming manner.  I loved the neighborhood.  It was very quiet and safe and convenient to public transportation or walking into downtown and beyond. 
,,,,,,,,"I never met the host, but every bit of information was sent to me very quickly. I had no problems getting into the room or main residence. I would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,I didn't end up going to Austin and staying at Julia's place but I do have nice things to say about her. She was always making sure that everything was going to be ok and when I told her I wasn't going to make it she took it well. 
,,,,,,,,"I had a fantastic time staying at this little gem of a place. The host, Jordan, was courteous and very helpful. This room is situated behind the main house, thus has excellent privacy and is very quiet. The price is very reasonable considering how well-equipped and how close it is to Austin downtown. Overall, a great place and I would certainly return the next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We needed a room at the last minute after something else fell through, and contacting Sara, the house manager was seamless.  We booked quickly and got our confirmation information within a matter of a half an hour.   Staying at this place was comfortable and easy.  We had our own room in a small house in the back of a main house.  The kitchen was ours to cook in and laundry was available.  "
,,,,,,,,Great location - easy walk downtown. Room clean and tidy. All requests for information dealt with super fast. Many thanks.
,,,,,,,,"The backhouse/carriage house room at Julia's B&B was a lovely place to stay for two nights in Austin (and my first airbnb experience). It's a basic, clean room at a great price in an well-located and hip part of town. I recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"The room was super quiet, clean and simple, with plenty of power outlets!!! And it has a private entrance. The property is super close to the downtown nightlife - a quick cab ride home (we could have walked easily in 10mins). We didn't use the kitchen (which looked super user friendly), nor did I shower (as we had a super early plane ride) so I can't comment on those. We are super happy with Julia and would not hesitate to book again if needed."
,,,,,,,,Julia was a fantastic host and there were no issues whatsoever. Great communication - she even helped me on the phone while she was on international travel before I arrived! 5/5 Stars! :-)
,,,,,,,,Great location. The hosts were very helpful and available. The room was tidy and clean. With air conditioning!
,,,,,,,,Great place in a very convenient location close to downtown and all the fun places in Austin. I definitely know where to stay next time I am in town. 
,,,,,,,,The room was exactly as described. The location can't be beat. It's perfect for anyone who wants to be close to all the action and probably won't be spending a ton of time in the roomâ€“ and why would you? There's so much awesome stuff to do! I was kinda worried about the bathroom being in the house but it really wasn't a big deal. And the codes on the doors makes it really easy to get in and out and not have to worry about keys and stuff. There is also beer and wine available with a suggested donation. We didn't have any but it's a thoughtful touch. 
,,,,,,,,I had a very positive experience staying in Julia's carriage home.  It was the perfect distance between both the conference center and East 6th street.  Also a close walk to Rainey.  Perfect location.  The house was clean and I did not have any problems. Great service!
,,,,,,,,"Communication with the host was good, was easy to come and go, there was a bit of an ant problem when I arrived, but they were sure to send an exterminator through and spray in and around the house on the day before I left.  The room is as described nothing special, but nice clean comfortable sheets. The bathroom was nice but it is inside the house so a bit inconvenient. 
I probably would not stay here again, but if you just need cheep place to stay, the house is quite and in a good neighborhood. "
,,,,,,,,"I had an unfortunate circumstance upon arrival, as I could not get into the carriage house with code given. I received response from owner and thankfully, there was another available room in the home. I was glad to have an option. In the morning, Sarah, who manages property, stopped by and rectified the situation. On the second day, I was able to stay in the carriage house, which is minimalist but has all the essentials I needed for a brief trip to Austin. The home is in a quiet residential neighborhood with ample street parking and walkable streets. It was close to popular running trail and some cool restaurants and shops. 

In regards to the main house and carriage house, the bathroom was not as tidy as expected but was not filthy either. In the carriage house, there is a small issue with ants that populate the entryway. The kitchen and living area were impeccable, though. 

I would recommend if you have a brief stop in Austin and require few amenities. "
,,,,,,,,The host was very helpful and it was a great location.
,,,,,,,,"I travel a lot, mostly for work. So I needed a place to stay in a pinch and Julia came through in, literally, a matter of minutes. It's a room in a small carriage house in the backyard. It's clean, has a comfortable bed, 4 walls and a place to put your stuff. I don't ask much. Bathroom and kitchen are inside the house so, its a few steps outside. It's also close to Rainey Street, the hot spot for all the cool new bar houses and many food trucks. Thanks Julia!"
,,,,,,,,In a cool neighborhood close to bars and eateries.  Clean quiet private room.  They even had beer and coconut water with a reasonable suggested donation.  I'd stay here again.
,,,,,,,,Nice private room in a decent location for a good rate.
,,,,,,,,"I loved the carriage house and the neighborhood. Very close and central to many interesting spots, including E. 6th with all of it's great bars, clubs and food trucks. Juliet was very nice and accommodating. The only thing I wished differently is that the bathroom were attached to the carriage house. It's in the main house which was a little inconvenient, but no biggie. "
,,,,,,,,Convenient location to downtown. Hosts very nice.
,,,,,,,,"What a gem! This little carriage house was perfect for my needs since I was only going to be in Austin a short time and wanted to be close to 6th Street but also come back to someplace quiet. The location is perfect for both access to entertainment as well as transportation. 

Juliet was an EXCELLENT host, although sadly we never crossed paths. She was quick to respond and made it feel like I already had a friend in Austin. 

I highly recommend Juliet's Carriage House, and hope to be back again! "
,,,,,,,,"Juliet was great - very prompt, friendly and accommodating."
,,,,,,,,"Juliet is as nice and beautiful as she looks! This room is separate to the house so it's private and very clean and comfortable. The location is a quick walk up to east 6th (east of 35) to various bars and food trucks including live such as Hotel Vegas and The White Horse.
"
,,,,,,,,"Jordan was an accommodating and friendly host, and his place is very close to downtown without being in the hectic middle of it all. The carriage house is spare, but nice, and the mattress is insanely comfortable. Would definitely stay again! Great coffee, breakfast and beer all right around the corner."
,,,,,,,,"The only problem with this rental is that you have to go outside into the main house to go to the bathroom.

Location was awesome...i could walk to where I wanted to go."
,,,,,,,,Great location! Right next to a bunch of neat places on east 6th. Wish there was a TV but the bed was comfy and exactly what I was looking for. 
,,,,,,,,"I couldn't imagine a better place to stay if you're looking to get the most out of your trip to Austin. Jordan's house is right in the middle of just about everything. It's about 5 blocks from the downtown tourist bar district and the bike trail along the river. But the best part is how close you are to East 6th street, which is the best part of the city in my opinion. I feel like I got really lucky finding Jordan's place. He was a really great host and was more than happy to tell me all the great places to go in Austin. Jordan also had a bike available for use, which turned out to be an invaluable part of my trip.

The detached part of the house where I stayed was great. It's bigger than I thought it would be. Really nice bed, a dresser, a desk and a place to hang your clothes. You don't really need much else. You need to go inside the house for the bathroom/shower which was totally fine. The place was clean and there were towels and soap and everything provided. 

I'm SUPER happy with my stay in Austin. Thank you Jordan for sharing your house and letting me feel like a local, not a tourist. "
,,,,,,,,"Jordan was a wonderful Host.  Very friendly and informative about the area.  I had a comfortable nightâ€™s sleep in the back carriage house.  The room was clean and met my needs.  Jordan has some renovation going on in the main house, but the bathroom and shower also met my needs.  I am especially grateful for the use of Jordanâ€™s bicycle.   What a great city to explore by bike.  Thank you Jordan.  "
,,,,,,,,"Jordan was super nice and laid back.  He accommodated me in the back house at the LAST MINUTE which was super kind. It was very clean and comfortable.  I didn't LOVE that I needed to go into the main house to use the restroom, especially when I needed to go at like 7AM!  Haha.  The BEST PART OF JORDAN'S PLACE IS THE LOCATION.  Soooo close to everything and so convenient.  I would stay again!  Oh and the bed was the most comfortable ever!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed in a unattached room behind the main house. One needs to enter the house to use the bathroom facilities.
The location is wonderful as I could walk to many areas although I did have a car.
Jordan had time the night I arrived to greet me although he was leaving the next morning on a trip so he would be gone for the duration of my stay.
 His brother Chris was a delightful host and was more than willing to answer any questions, give directions and he gave me his phone number in case I had any problems whatsoever.
Yet there came an issue one morning when I entered the house and Jordan had rented it out for a professional television shoot. I was unable to shower, went to the room in the back and as I was going to exit they were filming in the yard so I was rather stuck in the little back room until that was over.
Once all quiet, I gathered my things to go inside to shower (assuming they were gone after a few hours) only to run into someone in the back laundry room giving me the sign to be quiet as he said they were now filming inside the house.
By the time I did return to the room the floor and tables were crawling with ants. I had left but one whole apple.
I called Chris and asked him to return my call. I ended up doing the clean up myself after the morning and early afternoon of stress with the t.v. shoot. My experience was less than favorable.
I felt frustrated by a loss of time visiting Austin. I had noticed that the room wasn't spot on clean but it wasn't dirty. I'm a mother and these are two young men. I can't say I expected more. But when I mentioned the ants, the response I received was, ""I did clean thr floor with bleach a couple of months ago,"" Yikes! Months!
I think that renting out his house while having an airbnb guest was merely a poor call on Jordan's account. I felt badly for Chris as he was left in the middle not able to do anything about the situation and he felt badly.
But Jordan, as a host himself is great, the location is wonderful. I was barely there minutes and Jordan was offering me a glass of wine. 
I wouldn't let my experience deter you from booking with this host, but I suggest to always get full disclosure. Perhaps he needs to hire a house cleaner and wash the comforter or learn how. I surely felt/feel I should have been refunded for that last night. But his heart and his house are in the right place."
,,,,,,,,"Jordan's place was exactly what I needed for my trip to Austin. Nothing fancy but it was clean, comfortable, very close to downtown, and a good value. He was a very gracious host, providing me with recommendations and directions around Austin. I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend it to others looking for a place to crash. "
,,,,,,,,"I booked this room in order to attend a conference and was very happy with the proximity to the 6th st and the conference venue. Also the room was fantastic; had great space, a comfy bed, a desk and a hanger. It was a little chilly for me at night, and was great to have an electric heater available.  In overall, I was it was a good experience. 

The only thing i did not like was that when i arrived, the bathroom wasn't very clean. However, the cleaning lady did clean it after a few days.  "
,,,,,,,,Jordan was wonderful. He was very friendly and made sure that we were comfortable and that we had everything we needed. He is located in a great part of town just a short walk from the Capitol building and 6th street.
,,,,,,,,Great deal!  Jordan's a good host.  He is fair and honest.  Very good location with great access to downtown and the light rail. Safe neighborhood and very private.  I'd would highly recommend staying at this location.  
7400741,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Great home to accommodate large family.  1930 charm with comfortable set-up.  Large dining room and table which is great for sharing a meal with friends & family.
,,,,,,,,This was a great place to enjoy a vacation with my extended family!
,,,,,,,,This house was absolutely amazing! Stayed here with a group of 10 girls for a bachelorette party. It was very easy to communicate with Lindsay and The Renter's Club was available 24/7 with any questions we had. Check in/out was so easy! I would definitely recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,I absolutely loved this house! I stayed here with a group of 8 for a bachelorette party and this house was perfect. There is room for 10 to sleep comfortably (sharing beds) and the house is decorated impeccably for Austin. The Renter's Club manages the house and they were available to answer any questions (even at 10 p.m. when the A/C wasn't blowing strongly). I would definitely recommend large groups of girls or couples to stay here when visiting Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Home was exactly as pictured, a lot of great outdoor space, using renters club made it easy to accommodate coming and going. Only issue was the lockpad on the door was not locking properly making it harder when we tried to leave the house. other than that it was great!"
,,,,,,,,"The host and I never met or even spoke but she was very responsive and communicative via email and that was just fine.  The home was in a great location, tucked back away from the road but within easy access to nearby bars and restaurants and a quick ride to downtown.  When we arrived the house was immaculate and the furnishings were very comfortable.  For comfort, convenience and an overall great experience I would highly recommend this home to others and I would stay here again in a heart beat in the future."
,,,,,,,,"This house was amazing and Lindsay was a fantastic host who was more than accommodating when we had 12 girls stay here for a bachelorette party! It was the perfect house for our large group, but IMHO I would say although the house sleeps 12, it is better suited for 8-10. The front house sleeps 6 (2 to a bed) and is spacious with 3 rooms and 3 bathrooms.  Very comfortable with an AC unit that worked great (thank goodness!). The treehouse/back house sleeps 6 as well (3 people in a king bed) + the upstairs of the treehouse is a very neat little nest and sleeps 3 on twin beds, but can get HOT in the summer.  With that being said, we had no real complaints and had a wonderful experience with both the host, the house, and the location. I would highly recommend to anyone! "
,,,,,,,,Lindsay was fantastic! I'm from California and was planning a bachelorette party in Austin.  A package was lost in the mail a few days before our trip and Lindsay said I could mail it to her house.  She was so accommodating!  The house was great too.  9 of us stayed there and we didn't feel crammed. 
,,,,,,,,The listing is located super conveniently between downtown and UT Austin. The emails and notifications from the Renters Club made check in and out super easy.
,,,,,,,,"House was big, beautiful and plenty big enough to accommodate our girls weekend.  They were nice enough to allow us an early check in. Ample parking. Close to downtown areas. AC could have been more powerful."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent house and great communication. I'd come back to this house in a heartbeat.

We had 10 guys and there was plenty of space for us. The house is in great shape and very unique, lots of common area and patios for people to hang out in. I asked for early check in and late check out and they were able to accommodate my requests (and they answered me super fast). 

The house is in a great location. Very secluded from other houses so there's not a lot of noise. We went to dinners and bars around downtown and no cabs cost more than $10. This house is just close enough to the action but not right in the middle of it. 

"
,,,,,,,,The house was great and had more than enough space for my party of 7. I especially enjoyed the treehouse with its patios and views. I would definitely recommend this place to any future travelers to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"We rented the entire house and the adjacent apartment for 3 days for a women's retreat. They're both really cute and there was plenty of meeting space for our group of 20 (half the women just came for the day while the other half stayed at the house).

The only problem we ran into was the house not cooling off. Even when we first showed up and there were just two of us, it was around 78 degrees. As most of the women arrived it was well over 80. We alerted the renters club and they sent someone over that night while we were at dinner. Unfortunately, the house was still hot (I believe the thermostat said it was 86 degrees) so we had a pretty tough time sleeping. As the host, being sleep deprived and feeling awful for making the women stay in the house for the retreat put a real damper on my time here.

An A/C guy finally arrived the next evening and said it was a part he'd have to order that would take a few days. By then we were gone.

Luckily, the other women understood that it was out of our hands. 

Aside from that, this would've been the perfect house for our retreat. It's a great location, and a beautiful property. Also, the renter's club did an excellent job helping us out-of-towners plan our itinerary with  great recommendations for restaurants in the weeks preceding our stay. "
,,,,,,,,The cutest house! Perfect for a girls weekend getaway in Austin. Great location. Clean. 
,,,,,,,,The property was amazing. A perfect location for our event. The house was spacious and had most of the amenities we needed. It was a joy to cook in the house and had plenty of space for activities. The Renters Club was super helpful. I would book this property again in a heartbeat!
,,,,,,,,"This was our first Air BnB experience and it did not disappoint! The place was perfect and had everything we could possibly need. The house never felt cramped or too small for a group of 8 and had plenty of places to hangout with great friends, including a beautiful secluded back patio. The beds were comfy and clean, we couldn't have asked for a better experience!!"
,,,,,,,,"Best AirBnB experience to date!  The company that manages the property sends out an email the day prior to arrival with the address, directions, activity links, and a key code to enter the house - no stopping by an office or coordinating a meeting place/time in order to access the home! The homie is perfect for a large group.  Shady, intimate back yard, lots of spaces to sit and chat, and a perfect Austin location.  I highly recommend this property."
,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed our stay! My friends from school and I got together for a reunion. There were 10 of us total. I agree with the other reviewers that it never felt cramped! It was nice to have access to both the house and treehouse. A lot of room and amenities...everyone got a bed! Great porch and outdoor space in the back courtyard. The house was clean, check in/out was easy, and it was convenient to have access to The Renters Club for any immediate help/questions. They responded very quickly. Great location...quiet street and neighbors. No noise pollution at night. Less than 2 miles to downtown Austin and only a little farther to Rainey St. There are other shops, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance as well. Great running/biking trails across the street. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone! "
,,,,,,,,"We booked the Treehouse Fusion for 3 nights.  Being from Austin, I have to say this house and the treehouse were  perfectly Austin.  We were celebrating our wedding with friends from across the country.  All of our guests left wanting to stay here again.  A new tradition has begun.  Without a doubt it was the best possible location, vibe, and space one could want for a truly Austin celebration.  Hands down everyone loved the place.  We plan on doing this again next year."
,,,,,,,,"This house is just INCREDIBLE! I stayed here with 4 other coworkers on a business trip to Austin, and we were so bummed that we didn't get to take full advantage of this place. It is huge, gorgeously decorated, so unique, so many different outdoor areas to hang out in...I cannot say enough good things. We each had own own room, and I can see how this can easily and way comfortably fit more people. The Renters Club, who help manage the property, were so helpful - they were able to answer all my questions, and they maintain the property beautifully. If I'm ever back in Austin with a lot of people, I will definitely be trying to stay here! "
,,,,,,,,The house was clean and well stocked with toiletries. The wifi codes were readily available.
,,,,,,,,"This house was perfect for my bachelorette weekend. The location is awesome. Short uber rides to anything you would like to see. The house itself is adorable and huge! We had 12 girls and it never felt cramped. I have nothing bad to say. 

The renter's club thing was nice. Their response rate was instant when I had issues (couldn't get wifi to work at first) and questions. I regret not using the renter's club more for things like supplying groceries! "
,,,,,,,,"What a lovely home & location. It was perfect for a wedding/ family get-together. Private sleeping quarters & plenty of bathrooms made it very comfortable for 10 people. The outdoor courtyard was a perfect gathering spot for visiting and enjoying the weather. The AUSTIN lights above the fireplace are a big hit, beautiful way to welcome your guests."
,,,,,,,,We had a fabulous experience at Lindsay's home! This was the perfect location for our girls' college reunion trip. Lindsay was super responsive and helpful whenever we had questions. I highly recommend staying here! 
,,,,,,,,"House is well located close to restaurants, bars, etc.  The setup of the house is unorthodox, but really interesting and fun.  There's lots of nice porches and plenty of bedroom space.  Overall, a great experience.  Lindsay was a great communicator and very accommodating through the entire process.  Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,A wonderful property - the whole group were blown away with how awesome it was. 
,,,,,,,,"This place was PERFECT for our girl's weekend! It was super spacious with three bedrooms and two and a half baths in the main house and then two bedrooms and a full bath in the tree house. We had plenty of room to hang out and get ready in and the little courtyard was perfect to sit outside and enjoy the nice Austin weather. Thanks, Lindsay! Hope to come back soon!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a group of six and Lindsay's property was perfect.  We especially enjoyed the courtyard and the upper deck next to the Treehouse.  Great trip to Austin and awesome accommodations!  Thanks, Lindsay!"
,,,,,,,,"The host as well as the associated Renter's Club (that provided the additional services) were amazing. They were all very welcoming and accommodating to our needs every step of the way.  The house was quaint and so comfortable with plenty of space for everyone (we took a group of girls for a bachelorette trip). The location of the house was also awesome, we never paid more than $10 for a Lyft (for a Lyft plus, split between 6 people). View of downtown peeks through the trees from the patio of the treehouse. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was in a great location with easy access to downtown, UT campus and other central points in Austin.   We had a great stay with plenty of space for everyone."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Lindsay's was perfect! Once you book, you are connected to the Renter's Club, who you work with for the remainder of your time. We were allowed to both check in early and leave our bags late --  beyond accommodating! 12 of us stayed here, and it was the ideal girls' weekend. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, easily accessible to downtown by Uber (maybe 5-7 minutes), and within walking distance of a liquor store and restaurants. 

All 12 of us said a number of times that we couldn't wait to return in coming years. Austin is wonderful, Lindsay's place sublime, and the Renter's Club so easy to work with. Highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"What a great house with a perfect location.  Exactly as described. Perfectly clean and organized.  Plenty of room and amenities for our large group.  It really made our trip to Austin special.
Thank you"
,,,,,,,,"Very responsive host, however, we didn't need much other  than a few small things. The house is off a busy street, but walking distance for the adventurers-we used Uber too.
"
,,,,,,,,The place was just what we needed and more.
,,,,,,,,"Great house, everything as advertised on listing."
,,,,,,,,"The Tree House home was typical Austin, a little unusual in the BEST sense of the word. The layout of the 5 bedrooms was divided between 2 buildings that shared a courtyard patio as described in the posting. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was clean with good appliances. The bathrooms were well lit with nice fluffy towels. The location was convenient to all the main Austin attractions. Though just off a busy street, the house itself was quiet and the grounds had many nice shady trees. We would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"The house is very comfortable and the location is well placed near downtown Austin.  The spacious Tree House accommodations and our host provided everything we needed to thoroughly enjoy our ""guys weekend"" in Austin.  Loved the large dining room table for games and the courtyard style patio for hanging out in the morning.  Would definitely want to stay here again if we return to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The Downtown Treehouse combo was amazing! Perfect location and plenty of space for my 10 person group. 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was very accommodating, very attentive and helpful. The stay was excellent and the property was extremely comfortable and convenient. Would definitely stay again and will look it up next time we are in town. "
1645161,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Debbie was a wonderful host! A coworker and I were attending a conference at the convention center, and Debbie even had the house ready early which was great considering we were able to get settled before the conference began. The location is easy to find, and the house fit our needs perfectly. Thank you, Debbie, for a pleasant stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience while staying in Debbie's house. The house exceeded expectations and Debbie was very friendly, flexible and easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Debbie's amazing little home is the perfect ""home base"" if you're looking to explore Austin and feel like you're really part of the city while you're there. On top of this, the location puts you in a great upcoming part of the town with new and really unique restaurants and bars on the east side. This was my first trip to Austin, and Debbie not only prepared the house perfectly, but offered some great suggestions to check out while I was there (she's a true local and that is always helpful). 

On top of all this, you really can't beat the charm of this well-cared-for historic property. 

"
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying at Debbie's home in East Austin! Here are some highlights.

The house:
The house was beautiful and historic; we loved that we got our very own skeleton key for the front door. The rooms were spacious and we enjoyed her CD collection, playing music with the front door open at night. Beds were really comfy and everything we needed was in the kitchen. We fit five comfortably but keep in mind there's only one bathroom. 

The neighborhood:
East Austin is perfect and charming. The house is only a 10-15 minute walk to 6th street and the convention center. There are plenty of good restaurants and coffee shops within 5-15 minutes walk around there too; Blue Dahlia, Cenote and Easy Tiger were our favorites and were really close. It was just far enough away from the crowds to be quiet, but close enough to be walkable.

The host:
Debbie was great! She was so thoughtful, leaving a bag of her favorite coffee beans for us in the kitchen and walking us through the history of the house. She was also easily reachable if we needed her. We felt like we were saying goodbye to an old friend when we left!"
,,,,,,,,"Debbie's property was beautiful and impeccably maintained, and situated in a great location for the work we were doing in Austin during our stay. Highly recommended!"
15249439,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Tal and Guni were excellent hosts. They were extremely responsive and made sure checking in/out was easy. The apartment itself was well kept and in a perfect location (right on South Congress, with several great restaurants and shops). "
,,,,,,,,"Tal and Guni were very welcoming and accomodating upon my arrival, place was beautiful and in a great location!"
,,,,,,,,"Coordinating with Tal & Guni was simple and they were extremely responsive. My schedule wasn't very solid and Tal was super flexible with my arrival. 

The apartment was in a great location and not only clear but well appointed. I'd definitely stay again!"
5419307,4.5,8,10,9,10,10,8,"Mireille was able to provide us a cozy place to rest with wifi, Netflix, a washer and dryer, and the basic amenities you'd expect.  Her place is conveniently located in Austin and she was able to point us in the right direction to local activities and recommendations.  The neighborhood is quiet and we enjoyed our stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Good and bad. First of all, what a great, responsive, accommodating host! And the back yard sitting area is awesome, made the stay worth it. It's an older property in need of some TLC, and the stairs to the upper level are a little narrow and, well, scary. Great location close to everything cool in Austin. They are building a new subdivision next door, but I didn't find the noise to be an issue."
,,,,,,,,All of the pictures describe the place to be what it is. It's a great location with a lot of different food vendors and shopping areas around. Close to downtown 
,,,,,,,,"Mireille's place is cute and in a great location.
The downsides are: early morning construction immediately behind the bedroom wall. Also, for a place that costs $150/night the house rules required me to do a lot of cleaning. "
,,,,,,,,It was a good last minute booking. 
,,,,,,,,Super cozy and convenient.
,,,,,,,,"The location is perfect! Just an easy walk to 6th, n. Lamar and if your up for a little longer walk the s.congress bridge and capital. Remember Austin doesn't have Uber or Lyft so its walk, cab, bike, pedi cab or public transit. It was such an easy walk everywhere i never took my car. The place is small and old, but fine for one person that is planning on only sleeping there. There was building construction RIGHT behind the apartment that started at 6 am--- HORRIBLY Loud. The walls are also paper thin.  It was great for a night out on 6th though since i wasnt there Long. "
,,,,,,,,"I would highly, highly recommend this space to anyone visiting Austin. 

Not because it is a perfect experience, but because it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

Why is it a once-in-a-lifetime experience?

Well. 

You will notice that all of the pictures make this place seem fairly normal-sized. 

That's because everything in it *is* normal-sized. Relative to everything else. 

What is *not* clear from the pictures is that the reason everything is proportionally the correct size is that EVERYTHING IS MINIATURE. 

ACTUALLY MINIATURE. 

You see that couch? That is a 1.2-person-sized couch. 

The stove? The stove is literally thinner than I am. As in, I am horizontally wider than it. Seriously. 

The top of the nightstand table is actually the size of both my hands stuck together.

The bathroom requires me literally sticking my leg outside of it in order to successfully sit on the toilet. 

And the stairs require walking up and down it diagonally, because when I walk straight my shoulders DO NOT FIT BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE STAIRWELL. 

So. I genuinely enjoyed my stay, because I have never stayed in an actual hobbit house before and it was a charmingly novel experience. 

I also got to send my friends pictures of myself next to all of the miniature items, which provided social validation.

Again: highly recommended that you stay here. You will never experience another home like it with the possible exception of VIP backstage visitations to the set used in The Fellowship of the Ring by Peter Jackson. "
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful location with access to amazing restaurants, shops, and lovely (though hilly) strolls through my favorite neighborhood in Austin. The apartment is very clean, though quite small and would be uncomfortable for anyone very tall or large. As a fan of firm mattresses, I found the bed to be uncomfortable but others may not mind. Overall a good experience in a unique part of Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Mireille's place is perfect for couples or single travellers. It has all the necessities and is tucked away in a quant neighbourhood. It is within walking distance of great cafes, restaurants, bakeries and supermarkets. Mirieille was most accomodating and very responsive to requests and queries. We had a ball! "
,,,,,,,,Mireille made the entire process very easy. The place is in a great location and contributed to our wonderful time :). 
,,,,,,,,had a great stay! Lovely place to be and right next to 6th street. im defiantly coming back 
,,,,,,,,Mireille's place was clean and cozy.  It is in a nice neighborhood in Austin.  Great location to walk downtown.  I would recommend staying at this space whenever in Austin.  Mireille was fast at communication and made my stay nice and easy.  Thank you! 
,,,,,,,,"Very open communication. Easy process to check in. Size is small, but had everything we needed. I felt confident that Mirielle was just a text away if we had needed her for anything. Location is really convenient."
,,,,,,,,"It's a great little flat in a perfect location. It is very basically furnished, small but a perfect pad for one, who doesn't intend spending much time there. Communication with the host was very good and the very detailed guidelines helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice and cozy. Perfect for a single traveler. Surprisingly quiet. Close to Whole Foods and good restaurants. Fasten's are cheap to use to get to downtown Austin. It was very ideal for my needs. Would recommend, no doubt. Only downside is that the code Mireille sends you is very long and hard to memorize so you got to have it written down or have your phone be fully charged to make sure you don't accidentally lock yourself out of the airbnb."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, cozy cottage, easy!"
,,,,,,,,"This loft was small, but inviting - just enough space for me and my boyfriend.  Great location and the Oyster bar recommendation was top-notch!  Thank you for the detailed instructions.  I would recommend staying at this loft and look forward to our next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was a fantastic host! We booked the loft last minute and she was extremely accommodating, got us checked in no problems. The loft was cozy as listed! Awesome location! Walkable and close to all of the usual tourist spots, bars, restaurants but also on a nice quiet street. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great. Welcomed with a bottle of wine and some candy. 

House was neat and clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Can't beat this location either. In a very safe and friendly neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,Awesome location allows for walking to so many great restaurants & retail shops. The rental was cozy and small. Had all the necessities for a short stay. The hostess left a bottle of wine in the fridge & chocolates to snack on. My small dog did well there with a short walk to a nearby dog park. He could not get up the very steep stairs though.
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place! Close to everything! Very clean, and mireille was a great host! We booked within a few hours and stayed in Austin that night, we will be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Great little place for one or a couple. Mireille was informative and responsive even though I booked less than 24 hours in advance. Well located nearby bars and restaurants, and only 10ish minute walk from downtown."
,,,,,,,,Super cute unit located in Clarksville. I needed a place to stay with little notice and was able to book instantly and check in within one hour of my booking. Mireille was quick to response and the place was very accommodating. Location is great for walking to nearby shops and restaurants. I would definitely recommend staying here.
,,,,,,,,"Very beautiful neighborhood in Austin.  The residence was a bit under the weather as there was some construction going on in the adjacent units, but overall it was a charming and nice place to stay.  "
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I had the best time at Mireille's place.  The location is in the gorgeous Clarksville neighborhood of Austin, with tons of great bars, restaurants and shops walking distance or a short drive. Mireille was very responsive if I had any questions or needed anything...I would definitely stay with her again!  "
,,,,,,,,We had a great time staying in Austin! The apartment was great and we didn't have any trouble checking in/out
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time in Austin! We stayed in the C unit, which is a little smaller than the photos lead you to believe but still a very cute and charming place. The bed was very comfortable and my husband and I slept well each night (despite the slightly noisy neighbors one of the nights). I highly recommend this location and would love to stay there again :)"
,,,,,,,,Great location.. Easy access.. Very accomodating
,,,,,,,,"
Pros-
-air conditioning
-hot water lasted
-lots of windows (but con below negates this)
-quality blow dryer 
-lots of pillows for the bed
-sheets were soft and kept very clean
-amazing part of town: quiet, safe, walking distance from everything
-given the many cons listed below my husband and I would still consider staying here in the future because of the location. However; the bed may be something that ends up deterring us. 

Cons
-bed was too small for a person 6 ft or taller
-bed was small for two adults
-windows upstairs sealed shut-lack of fresh air
-unit c was a lot smaller than appears in pictures
-house looks very different from the pictures show; especially the front view
-unit c is slightly un-level"
,,,,,,,,"Really convenient location. Quiet but right on the edge of downtown.  I walked to 4th and Congress in about 25 minutes and had a quick Uber back. The other reviews are right about it being small, but as long as you are expecting it, it's not a big deal.  The ease of parking on the street right in front is HUGE downtown.  Mireille was very responsive to my questions about checking in.  Much better option than downtown hotels at 2-3x the cost."
,,,,,,,,"We felt very welcome! What a nice area, and close to everything. We were only in Austin a few days and this airbnb was perfect for 2. We didn't need food but being welcomed with candy and wine was a nice surprise!"
,,,,,,,,Small & simple. All the essentials for a quick stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,This place was nice and cozy! Had everything we needed. 
,,,,,,,,"There were pros and cons to my stay here and the property itself. I'll start with the pros: it's a safe, clean and quiet yet well situated neighborhood. The apartment itself is clean.

Cons: The photos on the listing are a little deceiving. The apartment is TINY. Sleeps two is a bit of an overstatement. Make sure you're very comfortable with the person you're staying with. 

Our air conditioning wasn't working and I had called on a Tuesday afternoon and didn't hear back until Thursday afternoon so there were some very hot, restless evenings in the apartment.

I wouldn't discourage people from staying here but I think being aware of the size is my biggest take away. Also, the pricing during SXSW was insane. Yes, I understand everyone raises their prices but the amount charged for this tiny place was a big absurd."
,,,,,,,,"The description of the loft is accurate.  It's cozy for sure - tiny.  Everything is functional, just tight.  The neighborhood is fine - quiet yet close to stores, restaurants and downtown.  Easy access with keyless entry."
,,,,,,,,"Pros: The location was good. Walkable to a few restaurants and about a $5 Lyft/Uber ride to downtown/6th street. The check in and welcome email were convenient, and we had no trouble finding parking. The apartment was clean. Cons: The apartment itself was very small. The bed was smaller than I pictured and wouldn't be good for anyone very tall; it also was kind of loud/squeaky if you got up in the middle of the night. The bathroom was also small and there was nowhere to put your things both by the sink and in the shower (a shower rack would go a long way). The stairs were quite steep and narrow and on the second floor it felt a little dangerous as the railing is only about a couple feet tall. Overall: We enjoyed our trip and the place was fine but next time in Austin I'd find somewhere else to stay."
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was a fantastic host and provided a clean, quiet, inviting home for us to enjoy and relax in during our first trip to Austin! We will definitely stay here again if available!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was in a great location for my trip, and a great value."
,,,,,,,,"This place is truly at a great location in Austin. A short walk to some nice places and you can jog to lady bird lake for a very pleasant work out. Oh and the welcome goodies were a very sweet and tasty touch! The unit we staid in is actually around the side, the door is not either of the 2 pictured on the front porch. So it was small, but pleasant. The only thing that was kinda annoying was the stairs up to the bed and bathroom, they were very narrow and slightly slanted so it was kinda difficult to walk up and down quickly. "
,,,,,,,,This is a great location!!! It's a bit small size wise but an incredible find off West 7th. Close to everything and the amenities are excellent. You can't get any closer to the best Austin has to offer. 
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay! The house was clean and everything was what we expected.  The space was cute, convenient, and located in an adorable neighborhood close to everything. I would recommend this place as a great alternative to an over priced, boring Austin hotel"
,,,,,,,,"Has to be the best location in Austin! Walking distance to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's along with a lot of other great Austin restaurants. Perfect size apt for two people although the bed is a little small, if you're tall. Host was lovely! "
,,,,,,,,"This loft was located in the best part of Austin and was clean and welcoming. Parking was a breeze but the loft was more cramped  than I expected and has very limited bathroom space to store your toiletries. The bed is very comfy so for a great night sleep, this is a good choice. "
,,,,,,,,This was a great airbnb. The host was excellent with communication and even left some welcome treats for me. Location was great. Next to cute bakery and in walking distance to downtown. I would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Mireille's loft was true to form - comfy, cozy, clean and very, very close to the great action on West 6th Street. It was a great place!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Dandy little room. The bed was comfy... the rooms were clean. As a tall man (6'4"") I found it a little cramped (hit my head on the light fixture downstairs... doh!). But regular-sized humans should have no problem. "
,,,,,,,,"Had an awesome trip to Austin! Mireille's spot was in a great location, central to a lot of the places we visited. You'll definitely go for an uber or bike if you're heading to campus, downtown, rainey, or south congress, but you can easily walk to West 6th. 

The place itself was cozy and delightful, although the pillows were a bit fluffier than we are used to :). As for Clarksville, it's pretty quiet and very residential. No nights of interrupted sleep which was nice.

For a quick tip, we walked to cafe medici for coffee each morning and had breakfast at the galaxy cafe across the street. Highly recommend both."
,,,,,,,,Great location! Very accommodating host. 
,,,,,,,,"Pictures are accurate, listing was as advertised."
,,,,,,,,"Cute little apartment. Clean. Great location! Walking distance to tons of restaurants, shops, Whole Foods, and much more. Ample parking. Great shared outdoor space in the back. Mireille even left us a bottle of wine! Would recommend this listing to a friend. "
,,,,,,,,This place is a really quaint loft in a really cool neighborhood really close to downtown.  Easy access to everything Austin has to offer.  Was just as described.
,,,,,,,,"Very cozy and quaint and in a great location!  The apartment was very clean and equipped with everything you could need.  The neighbors were a little loud but I do not think they were permanent residences.  We were able to turn on the fan to drown out the noise so it wasn't an issue.  All in all, a great stay.  I would certainly stay here again.   "
,,,,,,,,"Easy to get in, easy to find, comfortable and clean inside. Close to plenty of restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,"The place looked exactly like the pictures.  Mireille provided a complimentary bottle of wine and Halloween candy, which was a nice touch and was much appreciated.  The apartment was clean, everything smelled good, and the bed was comfortable.

The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful despite the fact that I saw many college-aged individuals in many of the nearby residences.

It is a great location for accessing downtown and there are some awesome restaurants within walking distance."
,,,,,,,,"The space was as described, spacious and a well equipped kitchen area. The neighbor is great, very quiet street and just a few blocks to many eating destinations. Walk to a  great bakery, whole foods, restaurants.  There is a shared parking space but street parking right in front was readily available."
,,,,,,,,"The pictures of the outside of the house were old the outside was a bit  rundown, the inside was very small the kitchen table you couldn't even sit at without your knees above the table.  We only had 3 towels to share between the 2 of us. the washer didn't work."
,,,,,,,,Great location near to bars and restaurants! Basic and yet cozy. 
,,,,,,,,The space was clean and cozy.  It was located in a beautiful neighborhood with tree-lined streets and interesting houses.  We were able to walk everywhere that we wanted to go.  It was a perfect size for two people.  The shower head had great pressure and the air conditioning combined with the ceiling fan made for very comfortable sleeping conditions.  There were no issues in any facet of our visit.  We would absolutely stay there again.  
,,,,,,,,Loved this rental! Super cute and in a really great location. Check in was super easy (I got in pretty late) and didn't need to meet anyone so I didn't feel like I was putting anyone out! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location - could walk to lots of great Austin locations including Town Lake, bakeries, great bars and eateries, REI, Whole Foods, Trader Joes.  The host left a bottle of wine and chocolate candy - nice touch.  "
,,,,,,,,"Yep, it was great. Felt right at home. Bed was comfy. "
,,,,,,,,Quaint little spot.  Had a blast.
,,,,,,,,Very nice and clean place to stay. The bottle of wine and chocolates were a very nice touch. Very close to downtown activities. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, close to downtown. "
,,,,,,,,"Very cute and clean bungalow near downtown Austin! The sleeping area is a bit tight up some steep stairs but it's comfy and cosy. I would stay here again! Also, the host was nice enough to leave us a welcoming treat :)"
,,,,,,,,Great for a short stay in Austin! The loft was cozy and convenient. Mireille was super responsive and check in/check out was seamless. 
,,,,,,,,A nice apartment in a nice neighborhood. Within a walking distance to the west 6th street with some restaurants but not to the east side which is popular with bars and night life. The welcoming wine and chocolate is appreciated.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location for a city trip to Austin. Appartement is quite small but well equipped. 

We never met Mireille in person but she was very helpful, responded super fast and gave proper instructions. 
Thanks for the lovely welcome-gift!"
,,,,,,,,Check-in was pretty seamless and the apartment was cozy and comfortable. Close walking distance to a handful of restaurants. Great stay overall!
,,,,,,,,groovy. 
,,,,,,,,We had a great time. The apartment was cozy and very convenient to downtown.
,,,,,,,,"This is an excellent lodging accommodation in Austin. It is conveniently located walking distance from many different things to do in the city. Just a few blocks from 6th Street (although not walking distance from the part of 6th most popular for nightlife.) It was easy to use Uber to get around very cheap.

I would not recommend more than two people staying here since there is only a full size bed available (although you could squeeze in three if you had to). The host had a nice bottle of white wine awaiting us upon check-in. And the there were plenty of clean towels and wash cloths for our use. Check-in and changing the lock code was easy per the instructions given.

We walked the first two mornings to Galaxy Cafe for breakfast. It was delicious. We also walked to a Whole Foods to stock up on water and snacks for the apartment. Although we did not use them, it was nice to have a coffee maker, toaster, and stove available. Wi-fi connection worked great."
,,,,,,,,The apartment was perfect for two for our one night stay in Austin.  The location is fantastic and the apartment was clean and comfortable.  We really enjoyed our stay!  Mireille was a great host and shared all of the information about the apartment with us to let us know how to get in and how to access the internet.  She even stayed in touch with us the day of our arrival to make sure that everything would be ready.  All of the photos of the apartment are accurate.  We would definitely stay again on our next visit to Austin!  Thank you again Mireille!
,,,,,,,,"We had the chance to rent Mireille Apartment for 4 days and it was perfect. The location is amazing with good restaurants, parks and grocery near by. Mireille is a wonderful host and respond super quickly to her emails. Thank you again for everything! "
,,,,,,,,"I can't say enough good things about this apt. VERY well appointed and spotlessly clean. The AC kept the Apt at an optimum temperature for the duration of the stay. It's not the largest space, but more that adequately accommodated my needs and is in a great location. Mireille was very responsive and I also had a bottle of wine and chocolate for my arrival, which was very welcomed after my long flight! "
,,,,,,,,"Charming, quaint hobbit house. Ceilings were low on the 1st Minnie floor. Although the Internet was great at first, in the evening when I needed to prep for meetings it did not allow me to down load My files. Place served it purpose."
,,,,,,,,Mireille was very responsive and helpful when booking this accommodation. The loft is cozy and a good size for 1-2 people and was a great base for my partner and I. Thank you to Mireille for the arrival treats! 
,,,,,,,,"While small and cozy, the loft was comfortable and exactly what we were needing for an Austin weekend trip. We really enjoyed the location, as we were in walking distance to great restaurants, shops, grocery stores, and downtown attractions. The bed was super comfortable and cable TV was a perk! My only complaint was that there weren't enough outlets near the mirrors for blow-drying/straightening my hair ;) But I was able to make it work. The place was very clean, which was much appreciated!"
,,,,,,,,Our stay in this loft was a perfect size for my wife and pup. We were walking distance from several restaurants and the drive time everywhere else we wanted to go to was less than 15 minutes away. The neighborhood is very quiet considering that it's 2 blocks away from west 6th st. Mireille was available to answer a few questions we had. There was a small welcoming gift when we arrived so it added an extra touch (bottle of wine and chocolate treats). Definitely recommend this place for 1 or 2 people. 
2934061,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,Great location. Perfect for exploring the 6th St scene. 
,,,,,,,,"Check in was easy. Besides the cable internet and TV issue, the rest of the home was in fine working order. The living room is definitely not designed for comfort, but, since I was there mainly to sleep, I just decided not to use the sofa and chair. Check out was a bit more complicated than check in due to the need to leave the gate opener in the apartment but still having the need to open the gate when driving out. Luckily, a kind resident helped us out. All in all, the building is convenient to everything for a business traveler and the unit is inexpensive but it could use updating in the kitchen."
,,,,,,,,"Erica's place was great, it was very clean, and the listing was accurate. It was in a convenient location downtown, within walking distance to all the best bars and restaurants. I would definitely choose to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The condo was clean, conveniently located, and completely accurate to the information given. The keypad entry was very convenient, as I did not need to obtain keys or worry about keeping them with me. I had two great nights of sleep in Austin because of this condo. "
,,,,,,,,Nice place in Austin downtown with fare prices. The apartment is well equiped and near to all the main atractions in Austin downtown.
,,,,,,,,"The place was just as described.  A bit loud at nights and more on weekends, but that was somewhat expected considering the prime location and the time we went (Cinco de Mayo!).  Bed comfy, AC worked great.  Street views and overall location were my favorite.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, clean, cozy. Very easy to access upon arrival. Had a great time in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Thank you for your flexibility with our dates!
,,,,,,,,"Great experience.  The apartment was easy to find and access thanks to the detailed instructions given prior to check-in.  When my flight arrived earlier than expected, I called and asked for an early check-in, which was not only granted but I was also given a late check out.  The apartment was very clean and stocked with the expected amenities.  Location was quiet thanks to the Quiet Hours in the complex. "
,,,,,,,,"Super central, great location!
Spacious, clean and comfortable. 
Loved it. 
Would def stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Very convenient location, we were able to walk to most places. The condo itself was very clean and spacious. We had a great time. I did, however ask about laundry detergent prior to arrival and was told that it was provided but there was none to be found and when I sent an email I didn't get a response. Aside from that this was a great find and we would definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great condo and a great location, with easy access to most of downtown Austin.  The property was as described, it was neat and clean when we arrived and the management company, TurnKey, was very responsive. The parking, while tight, came in very handy as did the washer and dryer. The biggest negative was that the wifi is so slow that it is nearly unusable. It is a 6 mbs open access point shared by the entire condo association and anyone else nearby that has figured out the password. Still, it is a good value and a great place to spend a week."
,,,,,,,,"Nice location, clean apartment. Perfect if you are going to Austin to party. 2 blocks from east 6th. Loud residents during nighttime and hard to park in lot. Good for short stays. "
,,,,,,,,"I booked the condo/location but did not stay there. A colleague stayed there and had the following to say about it:

It was noisy. The place was clean and fine except it was noisy.
There's a pool in the middle of the courtyard and every night around 10pm people would hang out and chat, the sound echoed and the apt is right above that pool."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is exactly as the photos in the webpage. The location is really good and it was clean. On the other hand I WOULDN'T RETURN to this apartment. It was in the second floor next to the pool and there were people partying there all night long and when I had to wake up at 8 am next morning they were still there. I literally couldn't sleep. The second night was a little bit quieter but it was loud until 3 am. The walls are really thin and there is nobody controlling the ""no parties, excessive noise"" policy. 
The communication at first was really good but after our first night I sent a message asking what to do regarding the noise and nobody answered."
,,,,,,,,Loved the code access to the building and apartment. The location was great. Enjoyed my time here!
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 113 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Great email communication leading up to my stay.  Simple and easy to use codes for entry to the building and the condo made my arrival pretty seamless.  The unit was just like the photos and in a great location! 
,,,,,,,,This was a great condo to stay in and was very conveniently located. The condo itself was beautiful and very clean! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, yet peaceful. Just steps from the pool, although we did not utilize during our two night stay. We did not use the kitchen at all, but seemed to have everything you would need (except glasses? we were using coffee cups for our am/pm ice waters) All in all a good stay. Thank you."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and logistics were smooth, but there were problems with noise from the pool area on my first two nights between midnight and 3am.  The walls are thin, and the bedroom faces the inner courtyard where the pool is, so noise and light filter in clearly throughout the night. Things happen, so I was fine with it the first night, but once the issue was flagged, the rental company just suggested waiting for the party to get going and then calling security. All in all, it's a good apartment for someone who is in Austin to party, but not for work or family trips. "
,,,,,,,,"The host sent specific instructions and directions twice in the days leading up to the trip so we knew exactly how to find and get into the condo. The pictures were accurate, it was quite clean, and most of all it was in a perfect location for us as it was walking distance to most places we wanted to go. It was our first time in Austin and we wanted to hit up all the touristy sights but didn't want the hassle of renting a car, and this location was perfect for that. If you're flying in from out of town and take the airport express bus in for $1.75, the bus stop is two blocks away. Unfortunately the building it's housed in, The Railyards, seems to have quite a few vacation properties. The late night pool parties, starting around 2 am and continuing until 3, kept me up for 2 of the nights and my wife a third night. There are signs everywhere reminding people of quiet time beginning at 10 in the courtyard, but people are jerks, so what can you do?  "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was true to the pictures and was a comfortable place to stay for a few days. Erica's team provided great customer service -- I had an issue with the combination on the key pad entry and they promptly reset it for me. The apartment has some small signs of wear and tear and there are some noisy neighbors, but it was overall a very convenient place to stay while in town for a conference.  "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was exactly as expected, amazing! Extremely clean with all the linens and toiletries we needed. All appliances were up to date, and the futon that was used as a second bed was comfortable. Loved the two door access to the bathroom so the main bedroom was not disturbed. Location was absolutely perfect, right downtown in the middle of everything- restaurants, bars, kayak rentals 2 blocks away, bike rentals 3 blocks away. The host was also great and extremely attentive!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 86 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed the space and the neighborhood, plenty of amenities all around.  There was a lot of communication from Erica right away and again in the days leading up to our stay, letting us know we could check in early and--as it turned out, check out late."
,,,,,,,,Great location and the condo was as advertised. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,The communication from Erica and her team was excellent.
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Clean flat. Quick resolution of any issues.

The cleaning fees (100$ approximately) are quite exorbitant though especially considering that you're supposed to take out the trash and start a batch of laundry for the towels before you leave."
,,,,,,,,Erica's company TurnKey made the entire rental process easy and painless. They were always available 24/7 and were happy to help. Would rent with them again and I probably will!
,,,,,,,,"When we initially checked in, the place wasn't cleaned.  I contacted Erica and she made things right.  She sent the maid over immediately, apologized and offered to pick up some food for us that evening.

The location is great for being downtown and close to all the action.  Probably not the best place if you are wanting a good nights rest though... the apartment complex was like a frat house and people were up yelling until like 4:30 a.m. both evenings.

Not sure why there is a TV there as there is no cable/satellite/dvd/blu ray.  It literally is just 'bring your own hdmi and device' I guess which was lame.  Also, it wasn't stated so no blame to renters but no wifi available.  No TV/Wifi makes it hard to unwind or work from this place.

Overall, probably wouldn't stay there again but did have great service and promptness from Erica and the Turnkey crew.  They were very great to work with."
,,,,,,,,"Clean, like the pictures, really nice and super close to the Convention Center. Was perfect."
14091567,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Overall experience was awesome. Jeff got in touch me as soon as I made the reservation and connected me to Kerensa. Kerensa helped us all through our stay with recommendations for restaurants, bar or anything we were interesting in. Kerensa is very knowledgeable and friendly. Our check-in/check-out was very smooth. Location is amazing. Would definitely book with Utopian again whenever possible."
11018787,,10,10,10,8,10,10,Junior was a wonderful host. He was proactive about greeting us and exchanging the key. He checked in to make sure we had what we needed. His space was well kept and very nice. I would happily stay again and recommend to others.
1232987,5,9,10,9,9,10,9,"Vincent was very accessible and responsive both before and during our trip! The place was clean and we had everything we needed. He even stocked the fridge with a few things for us, which was amazing!  

The apartment is in an amazing location and we really enjoyed our stay. "
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Very clean and comfortable place, and Vincent was great."
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriends and I took a weekend trip to Austin. Vincent's flat was perfect! It was clean, spacious and well equipped. The pictures don't do it justice.  The location couldn't get any better. It is truly in the middle of everything! Sixth street, Congress St, restaurants, bars, discotheques, live music, capital building, all within walking distance. Even though his flat is in the thick of things, it is quiet enough at night to get a good night sleep. Vincent himself is a very nice, easy going guy. It was easy to communicate with him and he made good recommendations for restaurants. I highly recommend this flat for a stay in Austin. I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,he was great and so was the place!
5103926,5,10,10,10,9,10,10,"My family and I stayed in Chelsea's Airbnb for a weekend and we had an outstanding experience. This house is very nice, clean and comfortable. It is located in a good area and close to all of the cool spots in Austin by walking distance. Chelsea is an excellent host. She left the house clean and ready and made us all feel like at home. She was always available for any help and inquiries. This Airbnb is perfect for anyone - family's, couples, group of friends, and for any occasion. I strongly suggest you book this place for a great time. "
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea's place was great for a visit to Austin. Walking distance to La Barbeque and other fun bars, food trucks and restaurants. Thanks for having us! "
,,,,,,,,Our stay in Chelsea's home was wonderful! The house was very clean and felt very cozy. Check in was quick and easy. The location s great! It was walking distance to a few of our favorite neighborhoods in Austin. I would definitely recommend to firends. 
,,,,,,,,House was excellent -- very clean with full amenities. Chelsea was also great at responding to any questions I had.
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay- exactly as advertised with convenient location and all necessary amenities.  
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea made this an easy one, everything was spot on in her description of the house, clean, great location and beers in the fridge once we arrived. The neighbors were super friendly and the house had a great vibe to it. Would 100% consider staying again. "
,,,,,,,,The house was great and in an amazing location! Chelsea was great at communicating before our stay and we had a great time in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Thanks Chelsea, we had a great trip to Austin!  You have a wonderfully spacious, modern house on the East side of Austin.

We enjoyed hanging out on the patio before walking only a few minutes away to a bunch of fun bars and great places to eat.  Everything was effortless, thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay with friends 
,,,,,,,,This house was exactly as pictured and perfect for our stay. We were in town for SXSW Eco and the house was easy walking distance to the convention center and downtown along with a host of restauarants and cafes on south 6th. Chelsea was extremely polite and easy to communicate with before and after the stay. We'll definitely be checking this place out again if in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"The house was awesome and in a great location - close to everything. The place was even nicer than the pictures looked online. Chelsea was a great host and provided easy check-in/check-out instructions as well as plenty of amenities.
I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it for anyone visiting Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,Chelsea's home was beautify and was a very short taxi ride to some great bars and restaurants. Everything was clean when we arrived and we had a fantastic time. Getting the key and checking in was very easy. Would definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,Great house and great location. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,This house was actually nicer than the pictures and the location was perfect!
,,,,,,,,Home was modern and included all amenities. There was more than enough towels provided for group of 7 to last a few days. The living room was comfortable and had a variety of board games and entertainment. Beds were comfortable and clean sheets. 
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea was a great host! Very responsive and made sure my friends arrived okay before I did, as they had an earlier flight. The house was just as pictured (clean and fairly modern) and fit my group of 7 perfectly. The area itself is a quieter section of town and has a good mix of city and suburb feel to it. We even walked to an awesome taco truck (vera cruz) right around the corner and it was a quick 5 min ride to 6th and Rainey Streets. Overall great stay and would definitely recommend to others."
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea was amazing!  Her replies were super prompt and she truly was the model host.  Her home was super clean and amazing.   It actually looked better in person than the pictures.  The rooms were super clean and had everything we needed including towels and a washer dryer!

We slept 7 comfortably for an awesome weekend of fun in Austin.
I could not be happier with my stay here and would absolutely recommend staying here. "
,,,,,,,,The host was great. They made the whole process of checking in and out quick and easy. The house was great with enough room for all 7 of us. Highly recommended. 
,,,,,,,,The house was great for 8 people. It was incredibly clean and there were plenty of towels for everyone. It looks even nicer than the photos (but heads up that black couch you see isn't there anymore) and has pretty much everything you might need for a group stay. The location is a short drive and sometimes even a walk from most places we were going to and definitely has a more quiet/neighborhood feel. Chelsea was also very fast to respond to any questions I had beforehand. Would definitely recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,Home was clean and very comfortable. Did not get to spend a lot of time there as we were there for a conference but was way better than staying at a hotel in my opinion. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,Chelsea was wonderful and easy to communicate with. The house is so cute and very close to everything in the area. We absolutely loved it and would definitely recommend staying here! 
,,,,,,,,"Cute, spacious home in the perfect neighborhood! Very accommodating hosts respond immediately to any questions! We would love to stay here again on our next visit :) "
,,,,,,,,There were 8 girls and the home was perfect!  Three spacious bedrooms and a great living room set up to accommodate everyone comfortably.  It's in a great location and walking distance to bars and restaurants.  The place was also spotless and instantly felt like home.  I would recommend to everyone!
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea sent me a very detailed set of instructions before we arrived, and the house was everything that we hoped it would be -- literally nothing whatsoever went wrong or awry, and we would definitely rent this house again."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, and Chelsea was super easy to book and communicate with.  "
,,,,,,,,Great location. Everything was neat and clean. Chelsea was helpful and responsive!!!
,,,,,,,,"Was in town for Thursday and Friday night and was my first Airbnb experience, I came away extremely impressed.  The house is beautifully decorated w parking for several cars in back and a front patio that accommodated all 6 of us comfortably.. Location was most ideal, w a 10 minute walk to 6th street and several other fun restaurants and activities.. I most def recommend and look forward to returning if we do make it back to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,We came into town for a wedding and stayed here with 5 guests. It was the perfect spot! The home was beautiful and had every amenity anyone could need. It was so nice to relax on the front porch and enjoy the neighborhood. Great location to walk to east 6th bars and shops. Super cheap ubers to downtown and easily walkable there as well. Chelsea communicated the check in and check out and we felt well taken care of. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to anyone looking for a spacious home to stay in! 
,,,,,,,,"Came to Austin with 7 girls on an annual trip and absolutely loved the place! The hosts were amazing, even stocking the fridge and a welcome basket. We had everything we could possible need at the house. Everything about the home was great, all bedrooms were spacious and comfortable. Best part was the porch to hang out and chill. East downtown was the center of Rainey Street and 6th street to go out. We walked everywhere during the day and never had any issues. Would highly recommend staying here, I know the next time we come back, Chelsea I am staying!
"
,,,,,,,,"Great spot, and Chelsea made great efforts to accommodate us in a pinch.  Location great for us, and the place was super clean and welcoming."
,,,,,,,,The perfect host. A very comfortable house in a great location. I would stay here again in a second 
,,,,,,,,A group of 8 girls stayed at this house for a bachelorette party and it worked out great! We were a quick Uber ride away from all of the downtown activities and also walking distance to coffee shops and food trucks! The house was nicely equipped with the essentials and having wifi was great as well. We would definitely recommend this house for anyone staying in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"ZOMG. This place is fabulous - it's super cute, very comfortable, clean, welcoming, and walkable to EVERYTHING. And I mean, everything - E 6th and Rainey are chock full of food trucks, restaurants, bars...all within a 10-12 minute walk from this house. The location is nice and quiet, so even though you're close to the hustle and bustle of E 6th, you're still far away enough to get a good night's sleep and enjoy a quiet cup of coffee or tea on the front porch in the morning...or afternoon, for that matter. 
Chelsea is a wonderful host - giving us recommendations for coffee, BBQ (!!), and restaurants which we took her up on and they were all really great. The house sleeps 6 comfortable, and I would definitely stay again. Fantastic find for our first trip to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Chelsea made us feel very welcome at this beautiful and spacious home. The house was very clean and we felt really much like at home. Location was perfect as well sooooo close to 6th street. Quiet neighborhood. Would highly recommend for groups of 6 to 8. 
,,,,,,,,"The home was even nicer than the pictures let on. The entire place was clean and there were plenty of towels and pillows to go around.  While we didn't meet the hosts in person, they were extremely accommodating and responsive as we planned out our trip. Would definitely recommend to anyone heading to Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,We had a very comfortable stay here. The house was perfectly situated to everything we wanted to do. It was just as advertised with enough room for the 8 people who stayed. Highly recommend it!
,,,,,,,,Chelsea's home was perfect for our weekend in Austin. There were plenty of towels (much appreciated) and she was very accommodating regarding the time for check in and check out. Location was great as well. Would definitely recommend to others.  
,,,,,,,,Chelsea was a great host who really helped make our stay in Austin great! Very responsive and accommodating on a number of fronts. The location was perfect and really accessible to all the sights. Thanks Chelsea!
,,,,,,,,"Visited Austin with a group of friends (5 adults, 2 kids, total). There was more than enough room in the house for all of us. We felt right at home, especially with the beer/cigars that were left for us. Like the other reviewers have said, this was a great location; we used Uber all weekend to take us around the city, and it never cost us more than $10. Chelsea was always a text message away, was great in helping us get settled in, and had fantastic recommendations for what to do while we were in town."
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. Went to Austin for a reunion weekend with college friends. We had such a great time and Chelsea's place was the perfect homebase. Didn't need to get in touch with Chelsea at all while we were there because everything was great/where she told us it would be. It was clean and there were plenty of fresh towels & sheets. The internet password was written on a whiteboard. Check in was easy because there is a lock box.
,,,,,,,,"This was a very clean and welcoming home.We were a group of 7 and had plenty of living space.
The beds were clean and comfortable, bedding very nice,towels aplenty,plush and clean.
Kitchen is well equipped.
Walking distance to a great little pizza shop and grocery.
Also within walking distance to 6th street nightlife.
Easy to find off major highway.
Chelsea was prompt with replies and easy to work with
When come to Austin again we will book here.

"
,,,,,,,,"The description of the house was accurate.  It had great amenities and was comfortable.  The house was very clean.  The neighborhood is conveniently located within walking distance to many downtown sites.  We were presently surprised at the number of local spots hidden in East Austin, all within 10 minutes walk.  The immediate area did have a number of rundown houses mixed in with newer and well maintained residences.  I would be slightly concerned walking alone in the evening, especially as you walk east.  Despite parts of the neighborhood being in disrepair, I would definitely stay here again.  Additionally, I have limited knowledge of Austin neighborhoods so don't have much to compare it too.  "
,,,,,,,,"This home is amazing! If you are staying in Austin, I highly recommend this home.  Great location, 10 minute walk to downtown/6th street, and plenty of private parking.  The host made us feel right at home.  The 3 bedrooms are very roomy and very clean.  The living room is very large and has plenty of seating. We booked this home for Austin City Limits and it was perfect!!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin for ACL was awesome thanks to Chelsea. The house and location were perfect, we had 6 people and had plenty of space for us all to spread out. Chelsea made the check in easy with detailed instructions and even left us some beer in the fridge as a welcome. The location of the place was great, within walking distance to Rainey St and some of the 6th st bars but a short Uber to everything. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea's home is beautiful, better than the pictures. The furniture, fixtures, etc. are all very new, clean, and comfortable. It's a cozy size but comfortable for 6+ people. Though we did not meet Chelsea, it was easy to access the keys and she was helpful and responsive via text. Thank you for welcoming us into your home!"
,,,,,,,,Lovely home. 
,,,,,,,,"I booked this house for my friends and I for a bachelorette party. This house was perfect! Great location and easy to get a quick Uber or Taxi to downtown (6th St). The neighborhood is nice and quiet, so we felt safe! We even walked to Rainey St. during the day on Sunday (15 minute walk).

The house was the perfect size for the 8 of us (we had 2 people on the pull-out couch).

Chelsea left her contact and wifi info in an easy to find place. Chelsea was very quick and attentive to my emails and texts. We all enjoyed our stay and would definitely look into renting the house again."
,,,,,,,,"The house was great; location is very near the convention center. We walked most of the time, and took a 4 buck uber a few other times.  Lots of great local restaurants in the neighborhood. The price was great! Overall I would certainly recommend this house!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 55 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Great vast house with very modern equipment and which was super clean...this made us feel extremely confortable during our stay in Austin!
The 2 bathrooms were very practical. 
Great location within walking distance of the charming raynee st.
Chelsea was a great host, super quick to answer to any question.
Only good things to say really!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was exactly as described, very clean and had everything we needed. We felt very much at home here and the location was perfect. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect. Immaculate, cute and in an awesome location. Everything we needed was available in the house. There were even treats in the the refrigerator. The neighborhood was darling. We absolutely loved Austin and can't wait to come back. When we do we would love to stay in the same house. "
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea was very easy to communicate with and her place made us all feel right ""at home"".  The listing was very accurate and the location of the house was just great for a girls weekend in Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"The home was perfect. The pictures did not do it justice. The hosts here incredible. I highly recommend this home. Great location, tons of space, and easily for all 7 of us. "
,,,,,,,,"This house could not be located better - it's a short walk across the train tracks to fun restaurants, bars and food truck lots on the east side. Rainey Street, downtown, Capitol building and the six street bars are also easily walkable. The house looks even better than the pictures. I really appreciated the front porch and the big bedrooms and how clean everything was.   The bathroom is stocked with plenty of towels and extra toilet paper.  The house itself is gorgeous and on a safe street.  The house is rather new with a security system it made us feel safe. "
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea was a wonderful host. The house was great, a lot more spacious than the pictures show. Perfect location, with walking distance to 6th and Rainey Street. Very communicative, always responded very quickly. The house was very clean. Would love to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This is a wonderful house that feels bigger inside that it looks in the photos! The hosts are friendly and responded to all of our questions quickly via text message, and they made our check-in and check-out easy and painless. The house was absolutely spotless clean when we checked in, and there was plenty of convenient street parking in front so we didn't even use the back parking area. We had 5 total guests, and we never felt crowded or that we didn't have enough space in this house. The living room was a very comfortable central place for us to spend time together, and the front porch was a great place for us to sit and relax after coming home each day. The neighborhood is relatively quiet considering how close it is to downtown - I sleep with earplugs at home and didn't need to use them here, and the loudest sounds I heard were doves singing during the day and crickets chirping outside at night. I was out in the front yard on the phone until 2:00 a.m. or later a few nights, and the neighborhood seemed so peaceful considering how close and convenient it is to downtown. My hometown of Phoenix is not really walkable, and this neighborhood had so many things for us to do within easy walking distance! We walked to a record store, coffee shops, food trucks, high-end barbecue, patio bars and restaurants, and all of them were within 10-15 minutes walking distance. Between the close proximity of so much stuff to do and how nice the house felt when we were at home, I would recommend this house to anyone wanting a complete East Austin experience and will check with Chelsea first on this house's availability whenever I come back to Austin! :)
"
,,,,,,,,"This listing was even better than the first time I looked at it because the pictures were updated. Mostly modern feel but in a vintage home. It was a fantastic location for us as it was near the UT campus (we were there for graduation) as well as close to downtown. This home was perfect for hosting a post graduation get together. We had the roomy front porch as well as living room and kitchen areas for visiting. Chelsea provided us w/a card table and chairs for the extra invitees. The beds were quite comfortable and the towels were soft. Chelsea even had a great vase in which to put my sunflowers! I would stay here again! Oh, and great places to eat or have a drink within walking distance!"
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place, great location. Chelsea eas very nice. Def would stay back here"
,,,,,,,,"Chelsea was friendly, helpful and quickly responsive to all our needs. She was friendly and easy to work with. The house was as described, clean and spacious. We would rent this place again. Thank you Chelsea !"
,,,,,,,,"We could not have had a better experience. Chelsea was wonderfully easy to communicate with, check in/check out were stress-free. Everything in the house was as pictured/described or better. Comfy bedding, soft towels, everything was clean, plenty of toiletries and extras. She also went the extra mile and stocked the house with snacks and drinks which was such an awesomely kind thing to do. The bike provided came in super handy and had double locks for safety. The location was fantastic and there really was not a single negative! We very much enjoyed unwinding on the front porch just watching the rain after the long days and nights of SXSW. Would absolutely stay here again. "
1743161,4.5,9,10,9,10,10,9,"PERFECT LOCATION!  
We truly enjoyed our week in Austin, and being at the center of downtown was a huge part of making our trip unforgettable.  This condo is not  fancy; it is, however, perfect for landing and staying in the best location for the best price.  I will be back to Austin, and I would rent this location again."
,,,,,,,,The Place is in a good location. We were able to walk to 6th street for a night out. It had a good amount of rooms for our larger party. It worked well for what we need. My only suggestion would be an increase in kitchen supplies. Other than that is was a wonderful stay.
,,,,,,,,"The location and value of this rental are excellent. Walking distance from many restaurants and bars. It was very spacious and had plenty of beds and bathrooms for our group! The pictures are very true to reality. The manager gave clear instructions, was responsive and helpful especially when we needed access through the gate!"
,,,,,,,,This unit is amazing! Great location and LOTS of space! The value is amazing! Worth every penny!
,,,,,,,,Strongly recommend this unit. The communication and instructions were very clear and easy to follow. Everything in th description was very accurate along with a very affordable price. 
,,,,,,,,Overall good place but Wi-fi needs significant boost. Also bath room locks needs to be repaired and linens needs to be upgraded. 
,,,,,,,,"The host was fantastic.  Great communication, great location, and I would certainly recommend for a larger group in need of multiple beds and private rooms.
"
,,,,,,,,Great experience!  Much better than staying at a hotel!  Right in the center of things in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Exactly as described. Great place to stay to explore Austin
,,,,,,,,Great host and tips
,,,,,,,,"An apartment that is located in central Austin, convenient for me and my musicians, being walking distance from the venue. Home and bathrooms clean, essential furniture, the small pool of available condominium (although we did not have time to use it. Good experience overall. Recommended."
,,,,,,,,The location of this condo can't be beat!  The condo is great for a larger group but you should know there are visible signs of wear throughout the place.  Communication was great and there were no issues.  
,,,,,,,,"My AustinStays visit was great.  First and foremost the location is awesome.  You're central to everything which means you won't need a car.  Plentiful cabs for any further out excursions.

The apartment is spacious.  There were five of us and we were comfortable without feeling like we were all over each other.  A/C was excellent for the hot Austin hear.

Checking and checkout was flawless and flexible.-

If you're your LGBTQ then you will be walking distance to every bar and club.

"
,,,,,,,,"Guys, this place is about three things:
-Location
-Location
-Location

Are there minor quirks? Sure. 

Are there more luxurious spots out there? Absolutely. 

Is there a better value for the price in the area for a larger group? Not a chance. This is the perfect spot for a weekend in town. "
,,,,,,,,"Couple of things to note - there is a 15% additional ""tax on rent for Austin condo rental"" that the owner will reach out to you about for staying here. I didn't see a mention of this on the listing on Airbnb's site so I would keep in mind the final price will be more than what is reflected on Airbnb. 

Also, the WiFi was not very strong. Our group had trouble staying connected and it was quite slow for a few of us that were trying to work from the apartment for a few hours. 

Other than that it is a great location and having 5 beds was nice for the size of our group. "
,,,,,,,,"Overall, happy with the place, especially because the location was so central to everything! There were plenty of beds, 2.5 baths which was nice. The condo wasn't the fanciest so if someone is looking for a ""swanky"" place to stay, this isn't it. But overall a good value and worth it for the location alone."
,,,,,,,,We were only here for one night but this was the perfect place to stay in Austin. The location is right in the middle if everything going on downtown. Most activities are a short ride away if not within walking distance. The place has more than enough room and was very clean. Checking in and out was very easy.
,,,,,,,,Great Location and everything worked out well for our stay. We would recommend this place to anyone looking for a condo near 6th street.
,,,,,,,,"First, the host was very responsive and accommodating, and I appreciated that tremendously. For the price and convenience that the apt was in downtown, this place was amazing. There were many walkable restaurants and bars from the apt. It's not the most luxurious apt, but it served its intended use to sleep and get ready for your day and night time activities, even for a group of around 8 guests.

I would definitely stay here again in the future. "
,,,,,,,,"The location is great. Near lots of food places, and walking distance to 6th Street.

The host was phenomenal. There was frequent communication leading up the trip, including suggestions of things to do around the location and suggestions for citywide activities. Any questions were answered promptly, usually within an hour of anything I asked.  I would stay there again the next time I'm in Austin with a group of that size."
,,,,,,,,Very responsive. Nice place. Perfect location. 
,,,,,,,,"Easy to get to, great location, all expected amenities.  We'll stay here if it's available next year. 

I'm not sure if there is an elevator and it's up 2 flights of stairs so make sure to ask about an elevator if you are disabled.  

I highly recommend this condo. "
,,,,,,,,Got this for my team during RTX.  No complaints.
,,,,,,,,"Host was incredibly responsive at all times both before and during the stay. The location was fantastic and was a great place for a group of friends to hang out for the weekend. The place is pretty basic (amenities pretty minimal), but it gets the job done!"
,,,,,,,,Thanks so much for the stay! We loved the condo and just as importantly the location! You have great instructions and recommendations! I'll surely seek you out the next time we visit!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin and staying at this perfectly-located condo.  There's nothing fancy about this place; but it had everything we needed for our weekend.

The location is ideal; we walked every where! It's in the safe downtown  in a secure building.  Finding the apartment was a little weird, as the numbers didn't seem to go in any sort of order; but that's not really a big deal, just something to keep in mind!

The apartment was clean and comfortable, with plenty of space for our group of 8. We didn't use much in the kitchen or the tv, as we spent most of our time out and about.

There is literally nothing I can say that was bad about our experience! We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to a group of people who just want to explore the city!"
,,,,,,,,We loved our condo and it was in the perfect location - central to everything. Would def come back for another visit!
,,,,,,,,AustinStays / Sandeep was a fantastic service. They provided accurate house information and helpful tips for bars/restaurants in the area. 
,,,,,,,,"Location of this Airbnb is perfect and makes everywhere in downtown Austin walkable.  The host was very responsive to all emails and queries, in particular in ensuring the wifi connection was running to full strength. However important to note that this is a rental property so the added touches as previously experienced with airbnb e.g. water/milk in fridges or little supplies etc were not there. Also the check in and out times were not ideal and even outside normal hotel standards , however the host kindly accommodated our request for an earlier check in.
We stayed during SXSW so paid a premium for the location during those dates â€“ however I would note that the apartment itself is pretty basic/has a college dorm feel to it â€“ it is not high end! One of the bedrooms does not have a window and 2 of the beds are in a mezzanine area so noisy if people are downstairs at night or early in the morning.

"
,,,,,,,,They were really accommodating and great to work with!
,,,,,,,,"Sandeep was a great host. Made us feel welcome to the city and paired it up with some great recommendations prior to our arrival. instructions were very easy to follow and we had no issues whatsoever. The description was accurate and the location was good beyond my expectations, it's literally so close to everything. I'd definitely recommend this place and seriously consider it when I come back. "
,,,,,,,,The listing was right on point and just what we needed. I went with a group of 6 guys to explore the nightlife of Austin and we had more than enough space and was very central to downtown.
,,,,,,,,"The place was great and as described.   It had 3 proper bedrooms (1.5 bathroom attached) on the first floor with two pull out couches.  Upstairs was the fourth room with two beds good for 4 people and another bathroom.  The sink however took some time to drain but it wasn't a horrible inconvenience.  The kitchen is relatively small but had the amenities we needed.  Just be careful of the stairs in the living room/kitchen area though.  The way it is situated is a bit odd.  Also be aware that you have to climb stairs to get to your room (we didn't see an elevator) and ask early on about parking situation.   The location is awesome.  We walked everywhere.  Overall we enjoyed because it was neat, spacious and convenient for us.  Thank you for hosting us!"
,,,,,,,,"Biggest strength is the location, which is a few minutes walk from the epicenter of restaurants and bars in Austin. There is even a bus to/from the airport ($2 fare) just a block away, making it very easy to get to. The apartment was clean and more or less as described in the Airbnb listing. The host was responsive when we reached out with issues (nothing major) or questions. One thing to watch out for --- entry to the kitchen is partially obstructed by the spiral staircase --- watch your head when walking in and out."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location right by 6th street. We had 10 people in our group, and it was a good amount of space. Sandeep was very helpful before our arrival, and even sent an email with a bunch of recommendations for restaurants/bars in Austin. He went above and beyond. "
,,,,,,,,Everything was great!  Our host had a pipe break in the room that we were supposed to use.  He called me and set us up in two rooms that were more than accomodating.  We will definitely use him again next year!
,,,,,,,,Sandeep was very responsive and his instructions getting to the air bnb was very detailed.  The location was perfect and it slept all the guest comfortably too.  
,,,,,,,,The stay went great and it was super close to everything. Thanks for the help!
,,,,,,,,"Sandeep's place was a good place to stay since we had an event at the Convention Center (it's a short two block walk).  Pros: quick walk, easy keypad access for multiple members of our party, fairly clean.  Cons: door didn't work very well, showerhead was broken and kept getting water all over the bathroom.  Overall, would stay there again. Economical and easy. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was in excellent conditions. Location was the best feature. Steps away from all the lively scene. We really had a great time in Austin and Sandeep was very welcoming. 
Only minor gripe, which does not detract from the overall experience was that the wireless internet was very slow. "
,,,,,,,,"Overall the stay was very good.  The location was superb and the accommodations were excellent for our group. 

The only negative was the amount of noise throughout the night.  With the 10 o'clock noise restriction I expected it to be quiet throughout the night, but unfortunately the walls of the condo are paper thin and we were able to hear people just talking in a normal voice in the hallway.  In addition the building next to the parking lot had the trash bins being emptied throughout the night each evening and that woke everyone up.   I am not sure that this can be rectified because this is a construction issue, but it was a little frustrating.
"
,,,,,,,,"Although I never had the pleasure of meeting him in person, Sandeep was a great host. He made it really easy to keep in contact and provided ample information on the condo and the surrounding area, making my group's stay extremely enjoyable.

The condo is in an excellent location, being just a quick stroll away from the bars on 6th as well as some amazing restaurants and sights in the surrounding area. I highly recommend this listing for anyone traveling to Austin in a group!"
,,,,,,,,The place was very clean and the location awesome. The parking space came in handy as well. 
,,,,,,,,Communication was good and quick. Easy to find. Accommodations were very good as described. Very close to nightlife.   Will rent from Sandeep again anytime I visit Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Things I liked:
- Great location, very convenient, close to everything
- Sandeep was very easy to get in touch with, via both msg and phone

Things I wasn't crazy about:
- The place is not as bright/new looking as you would think from the photos. It has stained carpets, the light grey sofa could do with a wash, the walls should be repainted, the bathroom is old, etc. It was clean, however it didn't feel clean. 
- The apartment is on the second floor of a condo without elevator. This isn't said in the description and it should.

It's not a ""pretty"" home, it's just functional. If you want a homey place, look somewhere else. If your priority is the location, this could be a good place for you."
,,,,,,,,Great flat in central Austin. Very conveniently located.
,,,,,,,,Stayed at Sandeep's condo in downtown Austin and was really pleased. The location is perfect for getting anywhere in downtown Austin and having 6 separate beds was a huge help for our group. Would defiantly stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Loved this place mostly for it's location (could walk just about anywhere downtown Austin, tons of restaurants and bars around, and very close to the convention center). I also appreciated how easy it was go arrive/depart... no waiting around or anything. The condo is fairly bare-bones, though not really divergent what we expected and comfortable enough. Doesn't feel all that ""homey"" but it did the trick. One issue is that the wifi was really not great; a few of us could never even get connected. Also, the showerhead was a little funky and difficult to get under for tall people. Had a good experience overall, though, and Sandeep was very professional and kind."
,,,,,,,,"Our visit was great.  The apartment is in a terrific location.  Everything we needed was on the premises and the apartment was clean and well appointed.  Overall, a great experience."
4815071,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Paula's home exceeded my expectations!  Besides being much larger than the pictures showed, the home was extremely comfortable and clean.  The kitchen was well equipped with everything I needed including a coffee maker and an expresso machine.  Paula event left coffee for us and a guide to all of the restaurants in walking distance - which were fantastic!  I really enjoyed my stay and I will definitely book this home again the next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"First of all, Austin is awesome. But it is even more awesome if you stay in an awesome place. Paula's house is indeed as gorgeous as you can see on the photos. A real treat for a design lover. It can very comfortably accommodate 5 people and as we were just 3 it was even better.     The neighbourhood is wonderful. We had a great stores and coffee places right around the corner and it was just a 15 min walk to the Capitol. Not to mention a cozy porch with comfy chairs and blankets so you can get this real texan experience of sitting outside with your lemonade. I highly recommend this place and Paula was super helpful and responsive. In fact we didn't really need any assistance but she always quickly answered to any questions we had before and during our stay."
,,,,,,,,"We felt welcome from our first steps up the path th this beautiful house. there are chairs on the porch, a table with many candles and blankets in the old picnic basket in case it gets chilly. Everything is clean. The space has many personal touches. The kitchen is very efficient. We had everything we needed, including a wonderful back yard with lots of chairs, and a few tables - perfect! Clarksville is a new favorite locale for us, thanks to Paula's BnB. The neighborhood is complete with a grocery, Cafe Medici for amazing coffee, and restaurants, a few shops. We loved our stay here!"

The location is fantastic, near Lady Bird Lake, shopping, and restaurants/bars. We had a rental car so very much appreciated the availability and ease of the parking garage. The 8th floor pool, fire pit, and deck were awesome amenities, especially during sunset.  The condo has a great view and is new and clean. The furnishings are tasteful but sparse. Everything you basically need is provided, including washing machine and dishwashing supplies! The hosts respond very quickly to any concern. All in all, we had a great trip to Austin, and would recommend the condo to others. And as a bonus, the Longhorns beat Baylor! Hook 'em! "

We had all the comforts of home while on a business trip traveling with our salon. The pool area was so nice and super relaxing! The neighbors were super nice and helpful as to giving us directions and even showed us the neat media rooms available to catch your favorite tv shows. We were a ale to sleep everyone comfortably with the queen, king, sofa and blow up bed all available. Washer and dryer in the apartment, 2 bathrooms with storage and large closets came in handy for the 4 women we had staying in the apartment. We will definitely be staying here again! "

5315903,5,10,10,9,9,10,10,"Ashley's place was great for a group of 6. It had room for everyone to sit around the massive TV, a large dining room table and lots of beds. Billy the neighbor was very friendly and always started our day off with some laughs through his personal insights. Ashley was very helpful in advance of our trip and sent me a long list of local hot spots for our itinerary. The location worked out well, being within a 20-30 minute walk from both downtown and the SoCo district. "
,,,,,,,,"Ashley was a very welcoming host and accommodating to all of our needs. House definitely had a very Austin vibe and was close to many of the areas we were interested in visiting, including Zilker Park, downtown, just to name a couple.  I felt like I was at home. I wish I had the interior design flair that she has. I would definitely recommend!"

,,,,,,,,"From the moment we were approved to stay at Ashley's home she messaged us and welcomed us to her home. We arrived at her great place and immediately felt at home. Ashley has a flair for interior design and tile work. Her upstairs bathroom is one of the coolest unique bathrooms I've ever seen. We walked around the neighborhood to the many restaurants & bars. The location of Ashley's place is great! It's walking distance to Zilker park, Barton Springs, and other great spots around south Lamar. "
,,,,,,,,Very happy with our stay. Location was great and our host provided us with instructions for everything we would need.  House was nice and private and felt like our own piece of Texas.

,,,,,,,,Ashley was an amazing host and was very pleasant to work with. She was very accommodating and it couldn't have been a better experience! 
,,,,,,,,"This is a great spot - only 10 mins drive from downtown and on a nice, quiet road. Spacious house with everything as was promised on the listing. Ashley was very communicative, friendly and useful - and Billy (the next door neighbor) adds a lovely local touch! A great place to stay if you want to be away from downtown, but a very quick Uber away"

15564640,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Location can't be beat as your steps away from the bars/restaurants of Rainey Street.

I'd definitely recommend this AirBnB and would stay here again.

The condo provides more of a hotel experience - we didn't meet the host at all and the place is managed by multiple people. "
,,,,,,,,"Definitely worth a stay, pretty central to east 6th, 6th street, Rainey Street and downtown.  A bit farther from the fun on South Congress and South Lamar, but there's a B-cycle station a block or two away!

The apartment was exactly as is in the photos.  Check in was easy.  And a washer/dryer is great for the longer trips (or to clean gym clothes before packing to leave).  While we only really spent our time sleeping there, it was excellent."
,,,,,,,,Always a great place to stay due to its location in downtown. With Fasten (alt to Uber) no need to rent a car plus a majority of what you need is all within walking distance. The condo is always clean and never disappoints.

We had 5 girls and we had enough space for everyone to get ready and not feel over crowded. We had a minor issue with getting in the gate but the host responded within minutes and we were all set!  Very pleased with everything and I think we will all be using AirBnB from now on!  Great host, great location, great apartment!  where can you go wrong!?  We will definitely be back!"

,,,,,,,,Kent was a true host again...he was able to accommodate my last minute request of arriving a day earlier promptly and enjoyed my stay.
,,,,,,,,Great location. Easy to walk everywhere and yet inside the complex was a calm retreat. Very clean inside with plenty of space. Loved that there was even a washer and dryer if necessary. The only thing to be aware of is parking is difficult to find even just for the initial unloading of luggage. 
,,,,,,,,Great apartment. Perfect for a few people and super close to everything. Really enjoyed our stay.

There's a pool and a parking space which were added bonuses. There was plenty of storage for clothes and a walk-in closet. The location was perfect as it was 1-1/2 blocks away from the convention center and within walking distance to so many restaurants, bars and shops.

The apartment itself is in an IDEAL location - walking to 6th, soco, rainey etc. And the complex is very nice. highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was very clean, bright and located less than 2 blocks from my conference hotel. I loved the atmosphere, the pool and the security of the two locks on the front door. Kent was super accommodating when I called in a panic for information I couldn't find in my email. Even though he was in Europe - and it was late at night, he was super cool and walked me through my dilemma. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin - its close to restaurants, clubs, Congress Ave and anything else you could possibly want to visit in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The place is exactly as described and just as nice as the pictures look. It was spotless when we arrived with even a little note on the chalkboard to welcome us :) The beds were extremely comfortable and even the pull out couch was great. There was even an air mattress in the closet if we needed it. The bathroom was well stocked with plenty of clean towels. However, the best thing about this place is the LOCATION. You couldn't pick a better spot than this. You can get to every great restaurant and bar on foot. The farthest we had to walk was half a mile. In conclusion, everything was perfect and I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great stay. Will continue to stay here on future trips. 
,,,,,,,,"Awesome condo in the heart of downtown Austin!  This was the perfect place for a trip to Austin with 4 of my girlfriends.  We were within walking distance to all the bars and tons of restaurants and didn't have to worry about driving or taking a cab, which was super convenient There was also plenty of space for 5 girls to get ready even though there is only one bathroom, there is an extra sink/mirror outside of the bathroom and a full length mirror in the bedroom - very much appreciated!! The host was extremely helpful and sent detailed instructions before our stay, and we couldn't have had a smoother Airbnb experience. Definitely recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome. So close and within walking distance to the nightlife of 6th street but still so quiet.

Would definitely recommend!! "
,,,,,,,,"Space was awesome. Super close to the convention center, check in was a breeze, and there was plenty of basics like toilet paper, detergent, and shower items provided.

The apartment itself is great! It is just as described in the listing. The keypad doorlock is a very convenient feature that allows fast and flexible arrivals and departures. The host emailed me clear instructions in advance. Inside it is very spacious and comfortable. There is powerful air conditioning for the warm Texas weather. The kitchen has all the necessary plates, glasses, cutlery, and appliances you could need. There is also nice fast private wifi.

,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location! We were attending a conference at the Austin Convention Center and this neighborhood was close enough to make getting to the conference very easy (we rented a car, but it was easy to hop a bus as well), but far enough away to be a quiet retreat. The house was big enough for the four of us to feel like we had separate space with a great common area on the first floor. Would absolutely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great experience.  The host was an excellent communicator, extremely hospitable, and check in and check out was simple.   The location was phenominal... walking distance to west 6th and other downtown hot spots.  Great for a large group looking for a home base.  "

,,,,,,,,"Chris' house was perfect for our large group's visit to Austin for Austin City Limits. It's convenient to downtown and Zilker Park. 
The house is spacious and comfortably sleeps a large group. Our group particularly enjoyed the large living room and dining area. Considering the heat in Austin, the temperature of the house was always comfortable. 
Check-in was easy and Chris was able to coordinate to let a few members of our group in early to drop off bags before heading to the festival. The house was immaculate when we arrived and stocked with plenty of towels and linens. 
We would definitely stay in Chris' place again during our next trip to ATX!"
,,,,,,,,"Chris was an awesome host.  The house was exactly as described, I had a group of 12 guys stay and there was enough room for all of us.   The location is great, a brief cab ride to all of the local scenes (There is no UBER in Austin).  Chris kept in constant communication and was very quick to respond to any needs that we may have.  Awesome place, awesome host, and one great weekend.  Thanks Chris. "
,,,,,,,,Chris let me into the AirBnB allowed me an earlier check in which was great! The area is really nice and right by 6th Street. The house was spacious enough for 10 guys to just hang out and sleep in. Would recommend to stay for large groups.

,,,,,,,,Very good experience here.
,,,,,,,,Great location close enough to congress for easy walking but not loud traffic at all!  The listing was quite accurate and a pleasant living space.

,,,,,,,,Solid location and place. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,Good host. Great communication. Nice location. All good things.
,,,,,,,,"Quiet, great location, walkable to downtown.  Very comfortable apartment.  A perfect SXSW base of operations.  Also when I left an iPad by accident after I checked out, Bryan dropped it off with a friend, that is hospitality above and beyond expectations."
,,,,,,,,Bryan made check-in incredibly easy with clear directions (complete with visuals). He was extremely attentive and thorough throughout the process. He left amenities and toiletries and anything I needed. This place is centrally located to both SoCo and downtown -- a great deal.
,,,,,,,,"Bryan's place was awesome! He sent a welcome packet the week before our trip, which contained clear instructions about how to access the apartment. It also had helpful info about the apartment complex and surrounding area. My fiance and I found the location to be great. It was easy to walk to walk north across the bridge as well as south down Congress Ave. The place was just as described, and we felt very welcome staying there. I would highly recommend Bryan's place!"
,,,,,,,,We loved staying here. Everything is at your doorstep or a ten minutes ride away. You have a beautiful private balcony with a cute squirrel coming to say hello every day.

Hospitality: A+
Cleanliness: B-
I would definitely stay here again and I would definitely recommend this property to a friend. Walkable to a ton of spots in South Congress and you're no more than a 10 minute Lyft/Uber from all the Austin hot spots. Small/fixable things like a clogged sink, messy electronics and a dirty balcony were the only things keeping this from being a 10/10 experience. 8/10. "
,,,,,,,,Brian was very professional and flexible. The unit was better than described and in a perfect location. He was very easy to communicate with and his response time was almost immediate. His instructions to check in and check out were very simple was was much appreciated. I would highly recommend his unit to anyone looking to be in a prime Austin location. 
,,,,,,,,"This was our first AirBnb experience. Our host, Bryan, was really nice, willing to answer any question we had, and communication was always easy as he promptly returned all of our messages. He is very flexible with check in and check out time, what helped us a lot as we were travelling by car and dependent of traffic conditions. 
The apartment is exactly as advertised. Cozy, well furnished and well equiped. The location is amazing. Right at South Congress Ave, one of the hot spots of Austin, 5 minutes walk to Downtown, less then 5 to the Town Lake and its walking and biking trails and perfect access to other main atractions such as East Austin and the Zilker Park. The instructions on how to access the apartment were very clear. Bryan sent us a PDF Guide with very detailed information. This file also have a helpful guide of â€œmust seeâ€ areas in town.  We had a great time there and would definetely stay at Bryanâ€™s place again. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Bryan's place is conveniently located in an apartment complex on South Congress, within walking distance of lots of restaurants and shops. Bryan was very responsive and made it simple to access/use his apartment. He kindly provided complimentary toiletries, as well.  The apartment is definitely lived-in, but it was clean overall and a good home base during our visit. There was ample space for 2 guests. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin staying at Bryan's apartment which was really straight forward to find and access. It's in a great location, a 10-15 minute walk to 6th Street, and all the bars and kooky shops of South Congress are just 7 minutes walking away. The apartment itself feels quite small, but there's enough room for 2 people. Everything we needed for the 3 nights we stayed was provided, both in the kitchen and the bathroom. We also made use of the convenient laundrette which is part of the apartment block. The only downsides were that the apartment smelled 'lived in', and the air conditioning unit was noisy (we couldn't turn it off). "
,,,,,,,,Great neighborhood and location. Very close to all of the awesome restaurants on Congress and a short walk to downtown/ 6th street. Was able to walk to Zilker Park in about 30 minutes. Apartment was clean and a great place to unwind after a long day at the festival.

,,,,,,,,"Laura was great!  Incredibly responsive and flexible, allowing us to leave our stuff both before and after our reservation.  She also provided recommendations.  The house is a great location, quiet and walking distance to everything.  Would highly recommend this house!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice stay, the home was as expected.  Laura's property management and hospitality was excellent."
,,,,,,,,"We had a fantastic time staying in this amazing house. The place is exactly as described and as shown in the pictures and is in a really good location, with the bars and restaurants of Rainey St just a short walk away. "
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in Austin. Good location and nice house. 
,,,,,,,,They did a fantastic job working with us. The property was clean and was in a great location.  The property manager went well out of her way to make sure we felt comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,We had an absolutely amazing time in Austin! The house was great and I'm already planning to bring a group of girls back next summer!! Nothing better then staying in a Waller Space!! 
,,,,,,,,"Laura was very friendly and welcoming.  My visit included 8 guys to celebrate my brother's bachelor party and we were coming in from different parts of the country.  She allowed us to check in early to accommodate for those who arrived early and allowed us to store the bags at the house after check out so we could go to brunch before flights.  She was always just a text away if we needed anything or had questions.  

The house itself was a very nice, modern 3 bedroom 3 bath with a loft.  There are a total of 5 beds, and two futon style couches.  There are TV's on both floors, a full kitchen, a great living and dining room - very roomy.  If you end up with the master bedroom, you are in for a treat, the bathroom and shower are awesome.  I would recommend bringing some earplugs, as there is no carpeting and sound travels easily, also might consider eye shades as it gets pretty bright in the rooms in the mornings.   The yard is great, we set up cornhole boards and hung out outside for an entire day.  Great neighborhood, walking distance to a ton of places.  Would highly recommend this place to those traveling with large groups. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was great and met all of our expectations based on the beautiful photos. Very modern, clean, spacious. Location was amazing, as was both the indoor and outdoor space. Host was extremely responsive to the few questions we had. Would highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"Well-located, modern, clean, good common and outdoor space, ideal for a group. Have never rented from a more accommodating or responsive property manager than Laura. I would be happy to stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Laura was excellent in responding to questions/concerns from the very first time I called inquiring about the property.  She was always pleasant and was prompt to respond.  

Nice having a park nearby for the young kids. The general area of the property was great.  Easy access to downtown and other points of interest.  "
,,,,,,,,"Overall a great AirBNB experience. Great location and house in Austin, walking distance to the Rainey St bars, 6th Street, and East Austin. We had a bachelor party of 8 guys and almost everyone had their own bed, which was great. Kevin and Laura were also great, communication was prompt, but we had no issues so we spoke/texted before and then on the day we left and that was it. 

I would highly recommend to anyone going to Austin that wants to be walking distance to downtown. But the neighborhood is quiet, so if you are their for a family event it could work as well. "
,,,,,,,,Great experience with the house. We highly recommend it and all occasions. Great location and house felt larger than the description.  We had a small issue with a bamboo tree knocking up against a window and it was handled very quickly which we really appreciated. 
,,,,,,,,Kevin's spot is quite the ideal base camp for people who want to be close to downtown but like an east-side feel. The place is brand new and very nicely appointed. Kevin and his house manager are very cool- friendly and welcoming.  Kevin is a Goldmine for local recommendations.  I plan to go back as soon as possible!
,,,,,,,,"This is a great house - great decor, easy to walk to places and has a lot of great amenities. The house manager, Laura, was super friendly and helpful and truly wanted to make sure we had a great experience! We would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"Wow, what a beautiful and open space! The house is centrally located off the 35 and close to downtown as well as the super fun east side. It has a large outdoor area, perfect for mellow wine nights but the bedrooms and Fatboy bean bags are so comfy that it's hard to wake up from afternoon naps. Communicating with Kevin was super easy. Would love to entertain at this property again. "
,,,,,,,,"I really liked this home and it was a treat to stay there. It was clean and well appointed, and Kevin and Laura were a delight. She really went the extra mile for us in receiving packages before our arrival. 

As for the neighborhood, I booked this house thinking our employees could walk to the convention center, but found myself taking Uber every time. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the early morning construction across the street. I would not hesitate to stay here again and will likely before the end of the year. It was a great place for our team of conventioneers to bond as a team. 

Huge thanks to Kevin and Laura for taking the effort to make our stay outstanding. :-)"
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful experience and stay.  The house is actually larger than it looks in the pictures, we had 11 guests and felt comfortable in the space.  The outdoor area was also perfect for entertaining - not pictured in the photos online was a bbq grill which came in handy over the course of the weekend.  The place was clean, well stocked with toiletries etc. and Kevin was also able to provide us with some airbeds.  I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Kevin but he was very responsive over text / e-mail which was perfect.  House is in close proximity (5-10 min walk) to Rainey Street which is full of restaurants and bars.  Overall, great experience and would definitely recommend it for larger groups."
,,,,,,,,"This place was gorgeous!! Lots of space, close to the action of the East Side, and Kevin was a great host. He was flexible with the check in & checkout times since no one was there prior to / after our visit. Also, the house was fully stocked -- beautiful grill, lots of dishes, towels, toiletries.. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly, and would love to stay here on our next Austin visit!"
,,,,,,,,"Great house - comfortable, very modern and well equipped. No problems with arrival/departure.  Nice area if a little close to a noisy road.
Guests should be aware that one of the rooms is up a steep set of stairs."
,,,,,,,,Kevin and his place were great!  We called on arrival and he was quick to answer and help us out.  The place itself was awesome--a great space with a relaxed feeling and great outdoor area to take in the Austin weather.  The house is also walkable to Rainy St with tons of great restaurants and nightlife. Everything else in downtown is just a few minutes away!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to meet up with a group in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Kevin made us feel incredibly welcome. Not only is his home gorgeous but it was well stocked with linens + little extras like shampoo and soap. When we had questions about anything he got back to us immediately. The backyard was lovely for hanging out in, and the WiFi even reached out there meaning we could do work with a cup of coffee in the morning while enjoying the weather. 

For context: we were a group of 7 coworkers and never felt cramped. The air mattress that was provided was also one of the fanciest I have ever seen! I would highly recommend this home for a group or family."
,,,,,,,,"I would definitely recommend this place! It's absolutely gorgeous, has plenty of space, and is spotlessly clean. Kevin was very helpful and immediately responsive. It's a cool neighborhood with a lot of character and fantastic local restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice home. Convenient to walking to Rainey Street, and just a short drive to the airport. Slept 8 comfortably. We would definitely come back. Kevin was friendly and a nice gift bag was waiting for us with some nuts and bbq seasonings.

No fault of the host, but this part of Austin has terrible tasting water and poor water pressure. Definitely pick up some bottled water, downstairs shower was much better than 2nd floor."
,,,,,,,,"I booked the Modern Farmhouse for three colleagues and myself to stay in when our distributed team met in Austin. The house is beautiful, clean, and comfortable; it's also in a great location, easily walkable to lots of great places in East Austin (and Rainey Street).

For corporate groups, I'd recommend considering the house a 3 bedroom/3 bathroom, as the sleeping loft doesn't have its own door, and requires walking down two flights of stairs to the first floor hall bathroom. For families or groups of friends, the sleeping loft is a great space, though! The bedrooms and bathrooms are all gorgeous.

Kevin was easy to communicate with, and we had a great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Kevin was great! The house looked even better than the pictures presented. The location is convenient, with everything being in walking distance. We had a large group (nine!) but we never felt crowded. It has a very open layout, with lots of light. I highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,The house was very nice!
,,,,,,,,The house was very nice and clean. Also an excellent location. Just a few minutes from downtown.
,,,,,,,,Awesome house and amenities. Fit our group's needs perfectly for a weekend in Austin. Easy access to Rainey Street and the trails. I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,The house lived up to it's description and the owner was very accommodating. We were in town for a convention and everything seemed close and easily accesible. We would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,Everything was tip top from beginning to end. Kevin knows what's up when it comes to Austin and entertainment...I would suggest anyone to stay at this property.
,,,,,,,,"Incredible house 2 blocks from Rainey street. This is the only place I've stayed in on airbnb that is actually nicer than the photos. The house is brand new as is everything in it. Comfy beds and bathrooms. Great private outdoor space.
Kevin is very helpful should you need anything. When I come back to Austin, no other place I would stay. This house is a no brainer"
,,,,,,,,"Great house and great experience ... The private side yard was awesome after a night on the town, great way to relax and have some quiet time alone. Thanks, Kevin!"
1895753,4.5,10,9,9,10,9,9,The decor was so cute & loved all the white.
,,,,,,,,"It is a little annoying to deal with their system, which is not very well integrated to Airbnb, but beside that it was a great value."
,,,,,,,,It's a very nice and well designed modern condo. Easy access to everything. But the wifi is annoying. We cant connect to the internet through entire stay. They have sent people to solve the problem but still the wifi didn't work at all. I have to run to Starbucks at night to get access to internet. The building code in the instruction email was wrong. We called and they gave us wrong codes again and again. Very frustrated.  Half tempted. 
,,,,,,,,"This is not really Erica's place. It's run by a company called Turnkey Solutions. I am a frequent customer of AirBNB. The purpose for I am staying at Airbnb is to support individual not corporate run places. When I booked this almost unit 3 month ago, I got annoying automatic computer generated reminders every day.  I was really annoyed and told them a few times to stop this nonsense.  It was not a good start of experience staying at this place. There are 3 units run by this company in this building. They all share the same wireless route. The signal is on and off.  I have to use my own wifi hotspot to get to work. There are two TV stations all connected to internet.  Since it has weak wifi connection, the resolution is poor.  The tv in bedroom never worked. The first night fuse associated with all bedroom lights are busted.  I went to fuse box and fixed myself.  When arriving, I had problem with gate code. I called the number they gave me. It's typical 1-800 company support number.  I waited for almost 10 minutes staying outside street to get hold of a support person. Bad experience before I even entered the room. The sliding door connected to bathroom rattles when some trucks on the street drives by.  Again, it's a bit annoying.  Location is superb.  It's very convenient to many good restaurants nearby.  It really depends on what you look for. The place is not that cheap.  Ironically I will recommend to stay at Marriott or Westin.  "
,,,,,,,,This is an extraordinary condo that is very comfortable and fantastic city location with access to all that downtown Austin has to offer.
,,,,,,,,This was a great downtown location and a really nice place.
,,,,,,,,Erica was very prompt on responding to questions and any issues. We had a great stay in a place that was exactly like the photos. Would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, cool apartment, loved the trip. "
,,,,,,,,I received email updates for an early check-in and late check-out so I didn't have to ask. I really appreciate that because that is the first time a host did that for me. I always had to ask. The place was very clean and toiletries were provided. The neighborhood was safe and it was so close to the JW Marriot where I needed to be for a conference. It was central to everything like restaurants and activities so I didn't have to drive too far for anything.
,,,,,,,,"What a lovely place! Well done!
Perfectly located for exploring DT Austin. One block from Antone's.
Super clean, cool, clever and classy. Everything you could need is in this condo. Good arrival, parking and departure instructions.

One small reservation: noise from 4th St and loud partiers from the condo complex. The owner supplies two white noise devices and they do help."
,,,,,,,,"The condo was very modern and everything done with taste.  The location was perfect!  I didn't give 5 stars because we after we entered the gate with the confirmation code and went to the room (3:40 pm) we realized that we didn't have another code to get in the door. I called Turnkey who asked me to listen to rules and regulations which I had done two weeks before.  Anyways, I got the code to get in the room.  I was supposed to get an email with the code also (in case I forgot it), but that never came to me.  Erica responded at 9:42 pm by text to make sure I had received the code.  On day two, the condo above me played loud music until 3:30 am.  I was thinking about knocking on their door, or calling the police."
,,,,,,,,"The place was great. Clean and looked just like the pictures. Super quick walk most places downtown. TV remotes were a bit wonky, but I wasn't really watching much TV so it was no biggie. Will definitely look to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,The unit was well outfitted with good appliances and was clean. We made use of the pull out sofa which was adequate for our stay. You are in the heart of downtown Austin here so there is buzzing night-life: all night. It's an easy walk to all the city has to offer. Our host was easily reachable and answered the one or two questions we had efficiently. The design of the space was well thought out and very functional. We would stay again!
,,,,,,,,The condo was clean and welcoming. The location was perfect! Right downtown - walking was easy to restaurants.
,,,,,,,,Great location. Quick walk to the convention center and local restaurants.  Would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Erica was incredibly accommodating! When we arrived, the place was clean and inviting, and it felt like we had our own apartment - and the location can't be beat!"
,,,,,,,,Great location in downtown Austin and comfortable place to stay.
,,,,,,,,"Literally the perfect location and perfect size apartment for 2 people. This condo made our SXSW really productive. You're really right in the center of everything which was perfect. The apartment itself was very clean and had everything we needed. Ample towels, plates, etc. Highly recommend this place! 

Check-in was very non-human, but I didn't mind that so much. "
,,,,,,,,"The place is clean and well maintained. Erica was super responsive and everything went smooth. Few things that could be better:
- The sofa bed is a bit broken. It doesn't stay straight, which meant that I had to sleep on an not optimal position.
- Wi-Fi was super slow.
- Lack of perks. No coffee, no water.. nothing.
Generally from a place of this range you would expect a little more attention to these details."
,,,,,,,,"Everything went smooth and the place was as advertised and well done.  Parking was gated and nice.  The wi-fi was terrible, though, so don't expect to stream any movies or anything."
,,,,,,,,"The listing was very accurate and exceeded expectations. The washer and dryer in the unit was very nice, and the overall quality of the apartment was excellent. Downtown is great and the apartment is located in a perfect spot; everything is easily accessible by walking. "
,,,,,,,,"We did not meet our host in person, but all arrangements were efficient, responsive, and cordial - a first rate experience. The condo was exactly as advertised - it was lovely, well equipped, and spotlessly clean. All in all, we couldn't have asked for a better stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Bottom line:
I don't consider myself to be a difficult or high-maintenance guest (which my previous reviews confirm), so it's with no pleasure that I say my experience here was the worst experience I've had on AirBNB.  
Great location, which is the primary reason why we choose the place. And as you can see from the photos, the place is obviously aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, my experience with the 3rd party company was unpleasant and frustrating from beginning to end. My attempts to reach out to them felt like fighting an uphill battle. 

Pre-arrival experience:
This is NOT your typical AirBNB situation. The condo seems to be both owned and managed by a 3rd party company called TurnKey Vacation Rentals, based out of Austin. (Had I realized that and spent the time to read other reviews about TurnKey, I would have known to avoid them.)
Iâ€™ve never experienced an AirBNB host who was less responsive. After charging my credit card, TurnKey didnâ€™t proactively send me instructions on how to locate/enter/exit the property.  I had to send THREE messages through AirBNB and call TurnKey TWICE before I finally got a response. 
It wasnâ€™t until the night before check-in (i.e. 16hr before check-in time) that I got a response from TurnKey.  An employee returned my call, and get this:  He said that unless I wanted to forfeit my $500+ rental, I had to give him my personal email address so that he could use their 3rd party system to email entry/exit directions for the property. Otherwise, he was not willing to provide the gate code and door code to the property through any other method. 
Absolutely ridiculous. My credit card had already been charged, and TurnKey refused to send me instructions on how to enter the property unless I gave them my personal email.
With no other choice, I gave TurnKey my email. Their 3rd party system sent me 2 emails. But NEITHER email contained instructions on how to enter/exit the property! I had to contact them AGAIN, at which point they finally sent me an AirBNB message close to midnight the day before arrival. Yes, you read correctlyâ€”their 3rd party email system ultimately failed, and so they had to use the AirBNB system anyway. What a hassle.

Arrival experience:
Dishes had clearly not been cleaned. Red lipstick around the rims of glasses, coffee mugs that had food on them. Completely unacceptable and unsanitary given the high premium paid for this unit. 
There was laundry in the washing machine that had been sitting there for daysâ€”you could see brown mold through the glass door. I didnâ€™t touch it.
Noisy as others have said. Appreciated the earplugs.

Afterward:
They offered a $25 starbucks gift card to make up for the awful experience (a ~4% refund). I rejected it. They then offered $50 but canceled the offer 8min later before I could even respond. Unbelievable. They would go no higher, so I had no choice but to accept what I could. I still feel unsatisfied."
,,,,,,,,Check in was super easy and instructions were clear. The apartment looks exactly like the photos and is really nice. I stayed here with my parents and was just going to use the sofa bed but the sofa bed is broken - its extremely slanted when opened and needed to put a plastic box under the bed to keep it upright. Also extremely loud at night but im from NYC so was kinda used to it. 
,,,,,,,,"Visited for business. Clean, welcoming apartment. As described in the listing. Great location, easy to get in and out. I will stay there again next time I visit!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location and really nice apartment.  Very modern and clean and close to everything.  

The apartment faces the street and it was very noisy.  Best to bring ear plugs.

The property is run through an agency so everything was easy and automated."
,,,,,,,,"Great location in Downtown. Easy walk or cab ride to bars, restaurants and to lady bird lake. It was a very clean apartment, it felt like staying in a hotel. Enjoyed the location the most. Only down fall, internet was very spotty.  "
,,,,,,,,"The condo was exactly as advertised. It was in an amazing location, and we had a great time exploring the city."
,,,,,,,,Great location!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, just one block from the Convention Center, and a couple of blocks from all the action on 6th street. The apartment was as advertised and clean."
,,,,,,,,"Me and my three friends really enjoyed our stay in Austin. 
The apartment was really well put together and the space is used well. We were really glad that it came with earplugs as the apartment is on a busy street.
Only issue would be the sofa bed that sloped down and needed propping up with cushions. I would recommend this place to friends and would come back in the future. "
,,,,,,,,"I did not meet the host, but communication through email was done in a timely manner. Renting the place was hassle free. The place felt super luxurious! The neighborhood was decent. The condo was perfect for our stay, since we wanted to be walking distance from 6th street. The private parking lot connected to the condo was a plus. We really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely come back! "
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"The word that comes to mind first is ""Wow!"" The Downtown condo was immaculate, better than pictured (which is saying a lot since the pictures show how pretty the place is) and wonderfully located. It absolutely made our stay in Austin amazing. Within a few blocks are more restaurants than I even imagined, and after our days of exploring it was magically to come back to the place and just relax. Erica and team are pure professionals!"
,,,,,,,,"Never met the host in person but all communications were timely and accurate.  The accommodations were as stated; very comfortable and in a good area for walking to local restaurants and sights. Host provided welcome white noise machines that helped distract from street noise. You are in a city, not the country, so expect sirens. 
All in all this place fit all of our needs and would certainly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment in a great part of town. Would definitely stay again. Very close to lots of bars, restaurants, etc. "
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"I really loved this place and hope to stay here again when in Austin. It is only two blocks from the convention center. The bed is super comfortable and the space is clean. I am a sensitive sleeper and there is noise at night from the street, but the white noise machine by the bed completely drowned it out and I slept great. "
,,,,,,,,"The Turnkey team was professional and efficient on their communications. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures, and everything was very clean and new. 

On the down side, the windows are not great and barely isolate from the noisy street. Not the best place if you are a light sleeper. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was absolutely perfect. I was only in town for a very quick trip, and the apartment had everything I needed. They did an awesome job of keeping me updated on everything before the trip and making sure I knew exactly what to do upon checkout. Wouldn't think twice about staying here again."
,,,,,,,,"Swanky place. Great location. Does get noisy on the weekends. But if you like being in the mix, this is the place. Check out Blenders and Bowls across the street as well as Handle Bar."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was amazing! The condo was beautiful and clean, we had everything we needed and enjoyed every minute. Thanks Turnkey! My boyfriend kept saying ""I could live here, I wish our place looked like this :)"""
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 98 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,This was my first AirBnB trip and it was great! Arrived and the apartment was exactly how described & beautiful. Easy to navigate around Austin & great communication. Will definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Dealing with Erika and her company was a breeze. Gated, quiet building in the perfect location for downtown. Easy access to sixth street, cute 2nd street district, the river, south congress, and within walking to the Capitol and UT.  Condo was perfect for 2 (4 would be a squeeze). Loved the separate sleeping and living areas. The condo was very clean and had all the amenities you might need (kitchen utensils, iron, hair dryer, hangers, etc). Seriously great location. Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"The listing description was accurate -- the apartment was beautiful and in a great location. The sofa bed, though, was broken upon arrival which made our stay fairly uncomfortable. If the pullout sofa hasn't been fixed, I do not recommend staying here with a party larger than 2. "
,,,,,,,,"The condo looked exactly like the picture, clean, modern, though maybe a bit smaller than it portrays in the photos. Behind the two chairs and the longhorn sculpture you can find the bed, which makes it a perfect little studio. It was a bit difficult to get cooking going, because there were no basic spices, herbs or sugar, which I ended up buying. It feels like most people don't take the effort to cook at this apartment because of it, though the Austin food scene is excellent :)

One downside is that it's very close to 6th street, which is the main drag of Austin. There were several nights where people were having conversations just outside of the room, which could be easily overheard because of single paned glass. However, this problem could be easily resolved with double paned glass for better isolation"
,,,,,,,,"Erica and the entire TurnKey team were amazing. We had a great stay, the condo was beautiful, the location was ideal. Couldn't have asked for a better weekend and would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The rental company was proactive - emailed me a week before with pertinent details, and again on the day of to make sure I was able to get n. There's an 800 number where someone is available any time to help. The unit was clean and well equipped with dishes, glassware, towels, toiletries, etc. The bedroom is tight, but the bed was fine and there is plenty of storage. The sleeper sofa was surprisingly comfortable. A couple of observations: there's a coffee maker, but no coffee, and only 2 wine glasses in an accommodation for 4. OK - the down side: Second floor, no elevator. NOISY. This is Austin, so I understand some late night noise, but the windows are single pane, directly over the street corner and the revelers never stopped! Plus sirens sounded at all hours of the night. I cannot recommend this location for anyone other than late night youths!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location. Beautiful space. Cozy, comfortable, new, nice kitchen. Everything you want for a couple day stay in Austin. There was a bit of street noise on Friday night - nothing too crazy but it was noticeable. "
286029,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,This house was perfect for our weekend in Austin. It was in location close to downtown in a very quiet neighborhood. There are a couple restaurants/bars that are walking distance from the house. 
,,,,,,,,Great location and so convenient.  Very simple and hip styling.  We had a great time.
,,,,,,,,such a beautiful place and a beautiful neighborhood!
,,,,,,,,"This listing was awesome! Right from the beginning, Brooke was very informative and professional in making sure we understood everything about our weekend stay. The home itself felt very comfortable and clean and the neighborhood was quiet which is just what we were looking for. Would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,Brooke's place is the perfect place to stay in Austin. The communication leading up to the stay was very clear and specific and the home is very nicely furnished. It exceeded my expectations and I'd love to stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"We had a WONDERFUL experience in this Vintage Modern Home on Josephine! We had 6 girls staying for the weekend and everyone raved over the cleanliness of the unit! The pull out couch was great, and everyone slept very comfortably! The house had everything we needed.... even condiments for coffee, including our favorite sweetener Truvia! "
,,,,,,,,Great place! Exactly as decribed. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"A great location just off S. Lamar, walking distance to excellent restaurants and bars. The house was very cozy and modern. The beds were comfortable and the whole place was immaculate. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Easy access, great location, and great communication.  Would definitely recommend "
,,,,,,,,"Brooke's communication was great. We were able to push our check-out time with only a quick call, which made our day-after-ACL experience much more relaxed.

The room is very central to everything, and a great overall spot."
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful gem in the heart of Austin! The location is very central to all of Austin's major attractions and in a quiet neighborhood. Parking on the street was never an issue. It was the perfect place for 2 couples to enjoy for a long weekend trip. Brooke was responsive to all my questions and provided us with lots of information before and during our trip.
"
,,,,,,,,The place is nice and comfortable. Its close to the Austin downtown and freeway. Brooke is very helpful and easy to communicate.
,,,,,,,,"Brooke was prompt and thorough with helpful information on finding, parking, checking in, staying at, and exploring around the Little Josephine property. My wife, 2 kids (11 & 15), and I were very comfortable and spent much of our 4 days lounging around with books, movies, and board games! We found ample dining and shopping opportunities near by. This charming location was the PERFECT getaway!  "
,,,,,,,,"Very cozy 2 bedroom near fun spots in downtown Austin. The AC did a great job keeping us comfortable, and the bathroom was stocked with helpful odds and ends. The pull out couch in the living room is not the most comfortable though, so be sure to put your heaviest sleepers out there! "
,,,,,,,,"Brooke is a great host, communication with her was quick, easy, and awesome. Very helpful and able to get us in a little early when we needed to drop bags off before a meeting. A+, would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our 3 days at the Vintage Modern Home in Austin. Booking was super easy and Brooke sent arrival instructions promptly.  Communication was excellent.  The space worked well for 2 adults and 3  9&10 year olds.  Everything we needed was there and easy to find.  The street parking was easy and never a hassle at anytime.  Walking distance to Zilker Park is ok for adults but a little long for the youngsters.
Beds were comfy and there was a wide selection of pillows to choose from.

We would stay here again and recommend to friends."
,,,,,,,,This is a cute little duplex in a great part of Austin. The neighborhood is beautiful and the house was neat and clean. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Located by some of the best restaurants in Austin. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Home was very clean, cute and very centrally located.  It worked great for us and we only needed 2 bedrooms.  Not sure how anymore would fit in the house.    "
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was clean and appeared just as it does in the photos. We never met our host, but appreciated the flexibility in allowing a late check out. The location was is a quiet and charming neighborhood, but definitely not within walking distance to the city's attractions. We ended up renting a car (conveniently, there is an Enterprise a few blocks away), and I would absolutely rent a car again in the future."
,,,,,,,,This little house is perfect for those who want to explore Austin. Great location and all the essentials made for the perfect weekend abode. 
,,,,,,,,Good. 
,,,,,,,,"I found this location which was extremely close to a business location I needed to work at during the week. Unlike most of the hotels in the area, this gave me  10 minute morning commutes, highly convenient.
The listing is very accurate, and describes the property well. What I found, which is hard to share, is how close this is to fantastic restaurants within a short walking distance. There are innumerable convenience features for this location, and I am certain that for our frequent visits to this customer, this will be the first location we will check.
It was clean, well provisioned, and even had a custom coffee blend in the cupboard ready for my morning wakeup."
,,,,,,,,The house was great! It is a little smaller than it appears in the pictures but it was still very comfortable. It is very centrally located and within walking distance to great restaurants and bars. Checking in and out was very easy with the Emerson Property app.
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location just south of downtown with easy access to Zilker, Barton Springs and S. Lamar. Exactly what I needed for my almost week long work stay. Quiet neighborhood, comfortable accommodations with a homey feel. Host's listing is spot on and app usage made communicating the necessary check-in and check-out steps a breeze. I hope to stay again on my next trip!"
,,,,,,,,Listing was accurate and the place was great. 
,,,,,,,,"Cute accomodation on the trendy side of Austin.  The location was perfect, parking was easy, and the interior of the rental was clean and comfortable.  "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience here. The accommodations were perfect: spacious, homey, and comfortable. The location was great. A nice walk to many locations or a quick uber ride to the city center. I highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Very clean, well appointed, and convenient.  Exactly as described.  Reservation, confirmation, access, etc all very smooth and professional.  Will be my first choice next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was as cute as the pictures! It was very clean and was stocked with many extras like an iron, condiments, and extra linens. It is located right in the middle of all the fun, yet the street and neighborhood were quiet and we felt safe. Accessing the keys was a little bit of a challenge, as the lock box seemed a little temperamental. Overall, we had a great experience and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the heart of Austin."
,,,,,,,,"House was cute, in a great part of town.  

Easy to use and looks like the photos. 

House was a little warn, could use a freshen up.

"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay! Perfect location, super clean and spacious. Owners were very responsive and kind! "
,,,,,,,,"We never saw or heard from our host but there wasn't a need to. Keys are easily provided and upon arrival and the unit was very clean and modern. It's very close to S. Lamar and Barton Springs and is a great location. It's just far enough away from Lamar that it feels very quiet and private but close enough to plenty of shopping and restaurants (to include Alamo Drafthouse) you can walk to a ton of things. I went for a great run around town lake. It's only 3-4 blocks away. It was a nice private place and we felt very at home there. Highly recommend for any reason to visit Austin. Oh, and the shower head was very relaxing. "
,,,,,,,,"I really wish I could give this place a good review.  Brooke is awesome and let me book this place the night before my arrival, despite the inconvenience of having to reschedule cleaning. My previous reservation got cancelled, so I was very grateful! 

We arrived after dark and parked on the street right by the house, when we got out of the car, I noticed broken glass everywhere. In the street and the yard.  My three year old daughter was in sandals and I was trying to unload and carry bags.  The area was not well lit at night, but the next day I discovered that a large area of the yard near the curb was mulched with broken glass!!!

The place didn't feel clean at all, I would expect a higher standard with such an expensive cleaning fee.  The carpet is ""vintage"" (needing to be replaced) and worst of all I had to kill a huge cockroach in the bathroom, which freaked me out, hopefully the only one in the place! 

There was a coffee maker, lots of coffee grounds and even half and half, but no coffee filters for the coffee maker. :(

The location is VERY good, and is definitely the best part about staying here."
,,,,,,,,"Very easy to work with, all information provided upfront.  Unit was great for our stay, not a large place but both beds are comfortable and the shower is great.  Location is excellent, near bicycle rental which we enjoyed.  Good for 2 couples that plan to spend most of their time out and about. "
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful location! Close to everything and walkable. 

House was good sized and fit 5 girls comfortably. 

Clean, comfortable and cute! Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,"Brooke was incredibly responsive and professional throughout the whole process. Everything about the property was as described. It's very cozy with ample amenities. The location is also ideal - 15 minute walk to Zilker Park, 30 minute walk to South Congress, and 7 minute drive to downtown."
,,,,,,,,The accommodation was perfect.  Exactly as it was indicated.  Brooke made the check-in and check-out processes incredibly smooth and hassle free.  Perfect weekend getaway in one of my favorite Austin neighborhoods.
,,,,,,,,Simple charming space in a great Austin neighborhood. Everything was great for our family. 
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location (a block away from the Alamo draft house in Lamar) and a  beautiful 2 bedroom straight out of ikea. While you still need a car or bike (for those adventurous), it's close enough to downtown to be a cheap Uber away from a bar, and far enough from South Congress so it stays quiet. We never met the owner, but communication through the Emerson mobile app was fairly straightforward. I usually like airbnbs for the local suggestions, so it would have been nice to get a bit more of that personal touch, but the place was exactly as advertised. Fully stocked with wifi, cable tv, coffee maker, enough towels, and all the essentials for a short 3-day stay."
,,,,,,,,The house was great and had everything we needed. Brooke was a great host and very responsive. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,The place was great. Very warming and comfortable. I decided to use an Airbnb house instead of a hotel downtown and am really glad I did. It made my business travel feel much more comfortable.
,,,,,,,,"The house was easy to find. We arrived at around 7 pm and found the key immediately, exactly as was described in the instructions we got before travelling. The house is very clean and has all the comfort again as described in the listing. Not far from the center of Austin, 45min on foot or take a bus that stops nearby. We also enjoyed the many restaurants that are just 2 blocks away. Shopping at a gas station 1 block away. Brooke was also helpful in finding the perfect restaurant downtown: we just sent a text msg and had an answer within minutes; great service. In short: a very nice stay in a house with all needed comfort in a nice neighbourhood."
,,,,,,,,"Seemed like a hotel with all the frames full of information. There was nothing I wondered about, and being that we didn't arrive until after midnight I was worried but everything went smoothly. 
Great location to everything! Nice quiet neighborhood. 
Nicely decorated and it was great to have a big washer and dryer. 
"
,,,,,,,,The place is very modern and was enough room for 5 of us to stay on a girls trip. It's in a quiet neighborhood and is close to local coffee shops/restaurants. It is walk-able to downtown Austin.  The place was very clean but on the last day we did notice a cockroach in the kitchen. 
,,,,,,,,"Brooke's rental comes with very clear instructions on how to find the home, where the key is located, check in and check out times, and important information about the house. The photos online are very accurate and representative of the space which is well appointed and functional. The beds were both very comfortable with nice linens and sufficient closet space. The bathroom included a hairdryer, shampoo, conditioner and liquid soap. The location is excellent - the neighborhood is modest, but safe and very central to the State Capitol and many restaurants and shops. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Brooke's home was perfect for our trip. We didn't drive the whole weekend because it was so close to everything. The house was stocked with necessities and the shower was THE BEST shower I've ever had. The only downside was the pull out couch was a little small for 2 of our (adult-sized) friends to share, we wish we had brought an air-mattress for a little more room, but that's on us. Would be perfect for 2 kids!"
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely great!  The house was well stocked, clean and close to everything -- a perfect place to stay during ACL.  Brooke was extremely accommodating, responsive and helped to create a very comfortable and seamless experience.  Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,We loved this place. Clean and comfortable and perfect for exploring Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Had a great time here, unit was super clean with all the amenities you would expect from a luxury hotel.  The owner was very accommodating and would highly recommend staying at any of her properties. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was in a prefect location for the activities my girls and I had planned. The Uber rides to downtown were very cheap from the house. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, and we had no issues with parking 2 vehicles. The house was spacious and adorable and the beds were comfy! Saw a few roaches in the bathroom, but I suppose that's to be expected with an older home. All in all I would stay here again and recommend this cute little house to anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! Great location, very clean, excellent shower! Would definitely stay again! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, and very clean and professionally run property. Easy parking out front. Brooke and her associates were very helpful."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect home away from home!  Clean, comfortable and close to everything.  I would definately stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great experience. It's a duplex but is very private. We never even saw the neighbors. It's in a very safe central location- close to everything! Beds were comfortable, place is super clean and the communication with Brooke was fine. I would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,Great house and in awesome location. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay. We were glad to have a car, but also ended up walking several places. The house had everything we needed for our one-week stay. When we needed to get in touch regarding one minor glitch (not enough keys), the response was quick and the problem was resolved immediately."
,,,,,,,,Awesome location and nice set up. Everything was perfect.
,,,,,,,,"Brooke's bungalow was perfect for my wife and I, and another couple we were traveling with.  Her home was smartly decorated and spacious, yet charming.  And the location was superb!  A few minutes walk from some of the best restaurants in the city, and a short drive to most everywhere else...  Hidden just back of one Austin's more populous streets so as to provide quiet comforts when needed.  It really was the perfect weekend locale."
,,,,,,,,"Lovely place!  Kid-friendly, very clean and well kept.  Quiet, friendly neighborhood street.  Easy parking.  Stayed with 2 kids and a baby, the high chair and pack'n'play were very convenient.  "
,,,,,,,,had a great stay with Brooke. I am a regular Airbnb user but first time at this property. Really enjoyed place and assistance.
,,,,,,,,"Brooke was very accommodating and very gracious. The house felt like it had been recently renovated, furniture and and it came with all the amenities one could need including, coincidentally, my favorite  Moroccan oil shampoo and conditioner. The house is in a great location in south austin. We could walk or bike to everything. "
,,,,,,,,"Brooke was a lovely host. She responded to emails quickly and was pleasant to correspond with. The rental was modern, comfy, centrally located, and had lots of extra amenities. We especially enjoyed taking walks around the neighborhood, as well as the close proximity to S. Lamar, S. Congress, Zilker, etc. Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic house in a location that can't be beat. If you want to be close to Zilker Park, Barton Springs, Town Lake, Whole Foods, and pretty much the rest of downtown, this is the place for you. The house was comfortable and quiet, and Brooke was awesome in getting things set up and responding promptly to any questions we had. This one's a winner!"
,,,,,,,,Perfect little place for me and my family to feel right at home while visiting Austin. Baby friendly with pack n' play and high chair! 
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was very nice.  The location is fantastic and the house was nicely decorated, comfortable, and clean.  Brooke was also very responsive to questions.  I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,This was a great apartment very close to Downtown and SoCo. Brooke was extremely accommodating and even went to target to buy towels and blankets for us when we needed extra. The house is extremely clean and central. it was really good value and I would stay there again next time I'm in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Great location, close to everything. Wonderful neighborhood tucked into one of the best areas of Austin in my opinion. We had everything we needed and the unit was immaculate. Brooke was always prompt with her responses. We will be back for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect, clean, in a great location. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"What a delightful place. Quiet, comfortable, immaculate, very thoughtfully outfitted for guests and right in the middle of everything (for walking or bus travel), this house was a perfect fit! Brooke was graciously accommodating when my reason for visiting Austin shifted by several months; now I can't wait to return and will definitely look for Brooke's properties for my next visit. "
,,,,,,,,"Needed a place in Austin near downtown for me, my wife and two kids (1yr and 3yr). The house perfect, exactly as described. Really great house/location for kids (5 minute drive to Barton springs/zilker park). Will definitely be booking this house for our next trip. Thanks Brooke!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderfully quiet and private. Convenient location.  Would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,My husband and I rented this place along with two other friends. We had such an awesome stay and immediately felt very comfortable in this super cute home. A very nice two-bedroom studio with many ammenities. Really cute furnishings and in really nice condition. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Austin! The location was super convenient with our rental car. And even resonable if you are on foot or bike. 
,,,,,,,,"Big thanks for a brilliant place to stay during Fantastic Fest!  Super close to venue, cozy and a great place to crash after a super busy day of films, parties and schmoozing!  Absolutely exceeded our expectations for amenities and tidiness.  We will most definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in Austin. The apartment was in impeccable condition, with some useful items that Brooke left us (fresh coffee and some essential condiments in the kitchen, shampoo, soap, etc in bathroom, pack and play for our baby). The location is very convenient to some of the best things Austin has to offer--flagship Whole Foods a few blocks away, House Wine wine bar within nice walk, SoCo and its shops and restaurants a short drive away, Zilker Park and Barton Springs within walking distance, plenty of places to rent bikes nearby...
The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant. Close enough to Lamar and freeways to get around easily, but secluded enough so that you can get some rest at night. The railroad tracks are far enough that noise from the trains is not a problem. We would definitely visit again, and felt we got good value for our money."
,,,,,,,,"Brooke responded quickly to my reservation request and described her property perfectly.  This home is everything it claims to be.  It is so perfectly nestled in a bustling area of Austin.  
The home was spacious, very clean, homey and just right for our visit. 
It was a home away from home indeed.

I'll definitely seek out Brooke for my stay next time I visit Austin.

"
,,,,,,,,Brooke was very responsive and understanding.  The house was a great place for us to stay in with our two year old.  Having a pack and play and a high chair was a big plus.  I would highly recommend staying in this location.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect! My husband and I stayed here with our 10 month old for 5 nights and had a great time. It is very clean and has everything you need. They provided a pack n' play and a high chair upon request. The location is great, it's very close to downtown, good places to eat and hang out yet is nestled in a very quiet, relaxing neighborhood. Brooke was very responsive and helpful and reserving the place was super easy. Having a washer & dryer saved on packing a ton of clothes. Oh, and the pillows were so good that I'm seeking them out to buy now that I'm home! We will be staying here again for sure. Can't recommend enough! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location!  We were able to walk to Barton Springs Rd. for coffee and juice in the mornings.  Great sized place, very clean, cool and equipped with all you need.  We stayed for nearly 10 days with our 3 month old baby and love the place!  Brooke is responsive and takes great care of the details."
,,,,,,,,"This is a really adorable house in a truly great location!

Comfortable bed, great pillows, washer and dryer, good internet connection... I couldn't ask for more.

Austin is not exactly the most friendly city for pedestrians, but we did walk to all the special places we wanted to go, like Torchy's and the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema."
,,,,,,,,This is a great house in a great location and Brooke was always very responsive.  Highly recommend it!
,,,,,,,,This is a very clean and comfortable duplex in a great location. I would recommend it to anyone staying in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location for what we were doing, running the Capital 10k.......we were able to run over to the start..great locaion.  It's a very quiet neighborhood.  We enjoyed the stay, but we will probably try other locations....that is part of the fun of Airbnb....never the same ol, same ol.
"
,,,,,,,,"Brooke's place was amazing. Location is really good. Quite area, close to downtown. I rented an electric bike to cruise around, but totally walkable.

My only complaint would be the furniture in the house. It has a hotel-ish feeling, but this is my personal opinion. 

Oh, also it has one of the best shower heads ever."
,,,,,,,,Airbnb is the only way to go!! 
,,,,,,,,When my husband and I travel to watch our college son play ball we prefer not to stay in hotels.  Grandma was making the trip to UT with us and Brooke's two bedroom home was perfect for our weekend visit.  The unit is immaculate and we will stay here again if we return to Austin.
,,,,,,,,Brooke and her friend where incredibly accomadating and the place was great. Its the best location in Austin and they are about as good a host as they can be. The place had everything. Thanks
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I got a weekend visit from our parents and we decided to put them in Brooke's home instead of a hotel. It worked out very well as the home is clean, quiet and nicely furnished. The location was excellent as well (especially if you're coming in for Austin City Limits) and my mom thought the sheets on the bed were awesome."
,,,,,,,,We stayed here for New Years and it was just perfect! We had a blast walking to Zilker Park and taking the bus downtown. This is a great location and beautiful place to stay. I will DEFINITELY be renting here again. 
9740173,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great place to stay in Austin, close to everything. We were able to walk to a lot of places from the apartment. Although the street can sometimes be noisy, the bedroom is set back into the apartment so we never noticed when we were asleep. Everything was clean, full kitchen. We didn't use much of the smart home stuff but seems pretty neat. It was nice to be able to come and go from the apartment with the app on my phone. The hosts were great and responsive when I had questions. We would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,Great spot
,,,,,,,,"This place was amazing! This was my fourth time staying in Austin for ACL fest and this place was the best so far. It's very spacious, has a comfortable bed and good bathrooms (the second half-bathroom came in handy), a nice big tv with all the apps you need, a perfect location that's walking distance to anywhere downtown. We even walked all the way back from the festival at Zilker Park one of the nights. It was the perfect place and Joe was very responsive throughout the whole booking process and stay. The only downside was it was a little pricey, but it was worth the quality, especially compared to other Airbnb's I've stayed at around the city. I will definitely be looking to stay here next year!"
,,,,,,,,"Het appartement was exact zoals op de foto's getoond. Gunstig gelegen, nabij 6th Street, maar ver genoeg weg om rustig te verblijven. 

Schoon, voorzien van alle denkbare gemakken en meer. Emma & Joe gaven ons een welkom gevoel. Snelle reacties op vragen en veel handige tips. 

Plus:
- lekker bed
- makkelijk slot (toegang via telefoon)
- 2 gratis parkeerplaatsen voor de deur die in het weekend van ons verblijf beschikbaar waren. "
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 140 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"this place was awesome!! the location was perfect. close to everything but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the bars. the house and all its furnishings was very clean and comfortable. we felt right at home. Emma was also a great hostess, gaining access to the property was a breeze. we were able to get right in. they also left some lamps on, so it was very welcoming and friendly. there was always a metered space out front for our car, and for over night we used the parking garage a block over, it was surprisingly convenient. this was our first Air BNB experience and we couldn't be happier."
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing location and apt! Emma's place was extremely easy to get to, and had an amazing view.  Far enough away from 6th st. so you didn't hear the all night craziness, but close enough that it was just a 5 min walk.  Thanks again Emma!  "
,,,,,,,,"Emma was an absolute pleasure to work with when I booked the unit for one of my colleague's during SXSW. Even though Emma wasn't there during the week of our stay, she put us in touch with her boyfriend, who was very professional and handled everything from start to finish. The unit was lovely and we had a fantastic time. Emma was also very easy to communicate with, even though she wasn't there. Thanks, Emma!"
,,,,,,,,"Emma was easy to contact during our stay. She was very hospitable with lots of great amenities. 
The apartment was in a great location downtown. We were able to walk almost every area we wanted to get to in Austin.  The kitchen was fully equipped with everything we needed. The living room was set up with a large television and record player, great place for relaxing! Bedroom was clean and bed was comfortable. 
Wonderful apartment in Austin! Would definitely recommend to others! "
,,,,,,,,Emma's place was spacious and comfortable.  It was also in a good location with many bars and restaurants in short walking distance.  I would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Emma's place was awesome.
It was in such a great location - it was clean, spacious and the bed was amazing.
It was my best air BNB experience to date and I would highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,"Location, furnishings, host communications and overall stay was SUPERB!   Emma is incredible. The apartment is very spacious and clean.  The photos and description are spot on.   I look forward to staying again when in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful stay at the property!
Emma was very accommodating & easy to deal with plus has very good taste in music! ;)
The bed is ridiculously comfy and the location is fantastic along with the view. 
It felt like ""home"" as soon as I arrived. 
Thanks so much for being a great host!
"
7825977,5,9,10,10,10,10,10,Great place and will definitely stay again!!
,,,,,,,,Great view!
,,,,,,,,Great lofts! Incredibly convenient and super friendly staff! Would definitely come back!
,,,,,,,,"My husband and his college friends (5 guys in their 50''s) stayed here for 4 nights last week. They said: ""cozy, great location for enjoying Austin, liked the convenience of entry code, vs. keys, multiple twin beds for singles and loft-style living. Would recommend more outlets in common areas and raised showerhead (installed for 5' person)"". Overall, they were very happy and would book again. The loved Austin and the ACL musuc festival. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,This was the perfect place to stay in Austin.  Close to everything and our host had a great welcome package and was excellent to communicate with.
,,,,,,,,"Chereen worked with me to accommodate our group size. If you need a parking space you need to buy a parking pass from them when you get there. This was not made clear and we spent a little extra money on temporary parking until we could get the pass. Overall, the place is nice and worked well for an overnight stay. The location is prime but 6th street can be rowdy so just be aware of your surroundings. They provide ear plugs which was nice."
,,,,,,,,"Apartment is exactly as presented- clean, organized, with keyless entry.  Great communication with Top Rentals team before and during the stay.  Apartment is steps from the bars of 6th street and centrally located for most things.  Note that the apartment has five beds but only one bathroom, which could be a consideration for many groups. "
,,,,,,,,"The lofts were amazing.  Right on 6th, eazy access to everything. I will definitely be staying here again. A must rent!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent place to stay.  My friends and I had an awesome time at this loft.  The host was non-intrusive and very accommodating, making it very easy to park, walk right up to the door, and get settled in.   There was even beer in the fridge for us and some chips and salsa to snack on, which got us comfortable really quick.  

One nice touch were complimentary ear plugs and white noise machines, since there were a handful of guys staying in the same loft. 

 The loft is right smack dab in the middle of the action on 6th street with nice views from the balcony."
,,,,,,,,"The listing was very accurate.  The host was very easy to communicate with and was extremely accommodating.  (We had to do an early check in and that was not a problem.)  The room was spacious, clean, and centrally located.  The only minor downside is the noise from the bars down the street.  But overall, a great place to stay in downtown Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This condo was perfect and exactly as described. Although 6th can get kind of noisy, it was never an issue for us.  The condo seemed to have pretty good noise insulation.  Noise machines and ear plugs were  on the premises although no one in our group found them necessary. The location was perfect.  Close to all the great bars and music on East 6th and an easy walk to West 6th and Rainey. Chereen from Top Trip Rentals helped make the whole rental process as easy as could be.  "
,,,,,,,,"This place is in a great central location for our group of friends in our mid 20's. A block away from the excitement on east 6th street and a short walk from west 6th. 
The place itself has clean beds and plenty of room. We didn't spend much time in the unit but when we did we wee comfortable. It shows its wear as a rental, especially in the single bathroom, so don't expect perfection and luxury. But it gets the job done. "
,,,,,,,,Excellent location. The noise from 6th street wasn't too bad. Would stay again
,,,,,,,,Great place. Amazing location. Clean and they even gave me gifts and surprises for my birthday!
,,,,,,,,I had an amazing stay with top trip rentals. I needed a place last minute and they gave me exactly what I needed. Beautiful place and in the perfect spot in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Was a great stay! Perfect location and comfy beds.
945496,4.5,9,10,10,9,10,9,"This was an overall nice stay. Excellent location in close proximity to downtown, great shopping, food and night life. The neighborhood is very quiet and feels safe. The apartment is small and older but the host really made a point to keep things clean, organized and welcoming! "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great responsive host and the listing was as described though I would not say it is dt Clarksville. It could have been cleaner and the mattress was uneven but linens, toiletries, and kitchen were great and the neighborhood is utterly charming. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location - quiet, clean complex - Lindsay was very informative and communicative about the directive of our stay - I would stay at Lindsay's place again!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Lindsay's apartment was exactly what we had hoped for. It was clean and in a lovely, quiet neighbourhood. We had grocery stores and restaurants you could walk to in 5 minutes and downtown Austin was only a 20 minute walk or $9 in a cab.

Lindsay made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable, this included Netflix and the biggest selection of teas outside of supermarkets. She also made sure we could contact her should we need to for information or any issues.

If we're staying in Austin again I'd definitely look to book with Lindsay again."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place for our weekend break. Bed was unbelievably comfortable, flat was very clean and had everything we needed, and location was great. "
,,,,,,,,"Although my time there was short it was really nice to come back to a quiet, clean, cozy apartment.  The neighborhood is quiet and residential so you definitely felt safe.  The apartment had all the amenities needed, catching up on my Netflix shows was a nice bonus.  Will definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent place, just as described. Safe neighborhood and a clean apartment centrally located. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in lovely neighbourhood. Very well equipped apartment with a great retro vibe that fits right in with Austin. The info pages are great and cover everything from live music apps to where to eat! We had a great few days there! 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a very accommodating host. The apartment was clean when we arrived and she provided us with everything that she described, including coffee, bath towels, dishes, and some kitchen utensils. She also left some information on the counter about the apartment and amenities, as well as suggestions of things to do. The Clarksville area seemed to be a safe, quiet residential neighborhood. Downtown Clarksville was a short walk with a few restaurants, cafes, and a small grocery store. However, if you're looking for more things to do the walk to downtown Austin is about 20-25 minutes. Overall, it was a nice place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was very cute, small, but met our needs just fine. The shower was a bit of a struggle since we are both tall but it worked out ok. It was really quiet and relaxing. The bed was very comfortable and the AC worked well in the hot August heat!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host and the place was so comfy and had a great vibe.  We only stayed one night, but that one night was awesome, the bed was AMAZING, from the awesome mattress to the soft sheets.  This was the best night sleep we've had in a while, so thank you for accommodating us! We will definitely stay here again!!!"
,,,,,,,,"All in all, an ok stay for AirBnB standard. Convenient location and a nice place to lay your head down. Also great that there is a parking spot available. The shower should be fixed as the shower head is broken and unless you're under 5 feet tall, is tough to shower in but the bed and space was both clean and comfortable. There was a misunderstanding in the beginning because of the lack of Lindsay's communication but she did everything she could to accommodate thereafter. Thanks for letting us stay at your place! "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was exactly as described. The place was clean, comfortable, and Clarksville neighborhood is very quiet. I love that she is very close to Deep Eddy Pool too. She kept in touch and was easily reached just in case. I would stay here again because I love the neighborhood and her place is an older unit which I am a big fan of vintage style apartments. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay sent great directions, and the check in process was seamless and easy. The apartment was in a quiet charming neighborhood within walking distance to many wonderful restaurants. It was clean and cozy, a comfortable place to return to after exploring Austin. I would definitely stay here again, and it's a place that I will recommend to my friends."
,,,,,,,,This place was perfect. Not one complaint. Loved all the recommendations and the location couldn't have been better!
,,,,,,,,Great location for the event I needed to go to. In walking distance to eat areas. Clean apartment. 
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was clean and attractive.  The apartment was immaculate upon my arrival, and quite adequately furnished and outfitted.  The host provided a bicycle, which I used for local commuting during my stay.  My requests and questions were attended to without delay, and with friendly professionalism.  I have no complaints or concerns.  I highly recommend this listing.  "
,,,,,,,,"Easy to find, centrally located, great guest instructions. Cute, quiet neighborhood. Convenient for downtown. "
,,,,,,,,We appreciated and utilized the suggestions of places to go in your information package. The place was clean and the bed was comfortable
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay for our first trip to Austin! Well represented by the pictures and had absolutely everything we needed. Awesome location to explore the city. Check in was a breeze. Thanks Lindsay!
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying at Lindsay's place during my short trip to Austin.  Pretty much everything was walking distance (we like to walk a lot) and it was a such a cute space.   It was very clean, comfortable, and well supplied.  Lindsay left us detailed notes and everything we needed.  I would definitely recommend Lindsay's place to friends if they were planning a trip to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place in Clarksville, Austin is a great little place to spend the week or weekend. I would recommend this to a couple or small group of friends no more than 3. The studio is simple and has all that you would need for a stay. The neighborhood is lovely and in a location there really aren't too many hotels in. We took a morning walk every morning to check out the historic area. Great dinning and grocery within walking distance. We had a rental car (there is 1-spot for covered parking which was nice with the Texas heat!) and could easily get to downtown, South Congress, and other locations from Clarksville. Lindsay was responsive before and during our stay. She made accommodations to let us check-in early as well which was appreciated. If I come back to Austin I would stay here a 2nd time!  "
,,,,,,,,Great little place. As described. No complains.
,,,,,,,,"This is my third time back to this cute little apartment. Great location, cozy and clean.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great location in Clarksville. Small, clean, quiet and perfect for what I was looking for!"
,,,,,,,,"Linsday is very nice. She let me in early and the place was spotless. She was also understanding when I had some travel plans go sideways, and offered to let me stay an extra day on short notice, although I ended up not taking her up on the offer.

Her apartment is very nice and close to downtown Austin. I am tall so the shower was sort of a challenge for me, but other than that I had no issues."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and easy check in, thank you."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was very helpful with suggestions of places to go and things to do. This place is very well located so we were able to walk to a lot of interesting places. We especially enjoyed the 24 Diner and Cipollina on West Lynn. Nice to have a coffee machine, but good coffee bistro a few minutes away if you need a Latte."
,,,,,,,,This is the second visit I've made to this property.  It's a cute little apartment in a mid-century building that is perfect for one or two people who are visiting Austin.   The neighborhood is very nice and I enjoyed walking thru the side streets or to restaurants located about 15 minutes away
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was initially not responsive to our contact but after airbnb got involved she communicated about our arrival details very quickly. We arrived late in the day after a delayed flight and check-in was smooth. Lindsay's pictures and description of the apartment were accurate. The space is simple but just what we needed for a landing pad in our week exploring Austin. The location is a quick 10 minute walk from the edge of downtown, more like 30 minutes to the heart of downtown. The only complaint is the bed is not super comfortable, if that matters to you. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's apartment was very cozy and the perfect base camp for our weekend trip to Austin. She made the check-in process very smooth, and we appreciated her suggestions for things to do around town. "
,,,,,,,,"Great overall experience.  Lindsay was very proactive in reaching out before I arrived. I arrived very late in the day and my arrival was  hassle free.    The apartment is small and older, but very cute and was clean and well set-up.    Very comfortable bed!   Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,The place was very comfortable and spacious. 
,,,,,,,,"Great experience! Lindsay was very responsive and the apartment was exactly as pictured. Comfy bed and linens. It's in a cute older apartment complex. Probably not close enough to walk to 6th street, but a very short/cheap uber ride away. Central to downtown and UT. Definitely would stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Lindsay's was super convenient for me - I was able to walk to / from most places. Also it's a great little set up with everything you need for a few days in Austin. Safe neighborhood, and I went for a run several mornings in the dark with no worries. Lindsay was also communicative and left the key for me so I was able to 'check in' and 'check out' at my own schedule. Would totally stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,Lindsay's apartment was a wonderful cozy place to stay.  The bed was very comfortable and I really appreciated the keurig coffee maker.  The location was perfect in a lovely neighborhood. I enjoyed morning walks around the neighborhood and it is close enough to jog to the trails around Lady Bird.  I would define try stay here again in the future!
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Great little apartment, comfortable and close to town."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host.  Although we never met her in person, Lindsay was very accessible, helpful, and directive.  

Lindsay gave us clear directions on how to access the apartment, which made check in very simple.  

The apartment was very clean, and it had all the essentials from towels to cooking ware...

We were able to experience peace and quiet at the apartment, knowing that, if we had problems or questions, Lindsay would have helped us as soon as possible.

Lindsay's apartment was a great place to have our first Austin adventure, and I would recommend it to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood! The listing was accurate and we got settled easily.  There are neighbors very close, so this should only be used by people that are comfortable hearing your neighbors. It was a nice comfy stay for us. "
,,,,,,,,Very good neighborhood. Very warm and charming space. Lindsay was responsive every time I needed her. Will recommend this highly.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean, comfy bed, and just enough space for 2. It is in a old apartment building on the first floor. The screen door was busted and the key liked to stick in the lock. But once inside, it had everything we needed (minus cable TV - but we knew that per the description). The ""Walk To 6th"" in the headline is doable - but it's about 2 miles to where the action is. We did not meet Lindsay,but she made her self available to us if we needed her."
,,,,,,,,Great communication from Lindsay!  Great little bungalow to stay in and experience Austin.  Perfect for a solo traveler trying to get a sense of the city.  
,,,,,,,,"Good communication with host. No problems with the place - dated, but very clean - and in a good neighborhood. Recommended. "
,,,,,,,,Everything went smoothly on a quick trip to Austin.  Everything was just as described and the bed was very comfortable and was a good relief after a long day.
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in fantastic neighbourhood.  Great location to give you some time out. It has everything you need and is very comfortable. Thanks for the tips!
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful host, location, and apartment. Perfect for two guests. Host was very accommodating. Look forward to another visit in the future."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place is great! Though small, it is very comfortable and extremely close to many different places in Austin. She didn't make much contact with me until a couple days before my arrival, but once she did she was extremely helpful and attentive. Every question or concern I had (which were minimal), was answered in an extremely quick and efficient manner. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay is a great host, easy to communicate with and available for whatever you may need during your stay. The apartment is cute, clean and comfy. Perfect location, close to everything. "
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful place to stay. There were 4 and we were comfortable. The air mattress (if you need it) takes up most of the living room, but a cozy space, I would stay again."
,,,,,,,,The Host gave easy instructions to get in. It wasn't exactly walking distance to anywhere. The house was neat and tidy. The pictures do make it seem bigger than it is which is fine. 
,,,,,,,,"I was disappointed in our stay.  I looked for a private home with two beds.  I had let Lindsey know that there would be me and a friend.  Yet when we arrived there was only a single bed and a horrible foam pleather couch (not pictured) with no bedding.  The place is cute, and other amenities were provided, but attempting to sleep on that couch was the worst experience I've ever had outside of camping.  Prior to our arrival I had to contact her three times before finally getting the information on the place just hours before our flight.  Just seemed very lackluster compared with other Airbnb accommodations for the same rate."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was the perfect hostess.  Lots of communication leading up to the trip and a terrific personalized guide to the home, the neighborhood, and Austin sitting on the counter as I walked in.  Though I didn't need to reach out to her, she left several text messages, reminding me that she was available for any advice, assistance, etc.  The home itself, perfect for 1 or 2 people, quiet neighborhood, but within a few blocks from groceries, cafes, and the downtown music scene.  "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay is a friendly, accommodating host.  Her place is cozy, comfortable, and just right for my needs.  Also, I love the neighborhood.  I'm looking forward to staying there again very soon!"
,,,,,,,,"The downtown Clarksville apartment was perfect.  At first glance, the building seems questionable because it doesn't look the nicest, but once you enter the apartment, it is cute, clean and comfortable.  Perfect for 2 people.  Easy access to the apartment and Lindsay was available via text message for any questions.  She also left a nice list of restaurants, things to do, and rental places around Austin.
The location is perfect.  Easy to access several different areas on foot or by bike.  Easy walk to restaurants like Cippollina and Zocolas.  Great cocktails at Josephines.  We also walked to west 6th street for drinks one evening.  Within walking distance to Baylor street graffiti park too.
We rented bikes from a local vendor and also used Lyft to get around.
We had a great time visiting Austin and this apartment was better then a hotel.  We met some neighbors and everyone was so nice!  If we come back to Austin, I would def look to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"A great and charming neighborhood and jumping off place to explore downtown Austin and beyond. Cute place with everything I needed! Didn't get a chance to meet Lindsay, but she's great with communication and setting you up for your stay. "
,,,,,,,,The place was very charming! It is on the smaller side but Lindsay was very honest about the size and even offered another place if we were looking for more room. I greatly appreciated that. Lindsay also left a list of things to do in Austin which we found to be very helpful! We would highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place for two to stay! It is in a perfect location - whatever you're into, it's nearby. Lindsey left awesome recommendations and was very helpful - book if you can!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful long weekend at Lindsay's place. It was cozy, clean and well appointed and stocked as promised. It is convenient to all the must-go places and met all our needs and more. A happy memory: "
,,,,,,,,"Cute apartment, clean and as described. Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was spotless, the location is great, and the host is very welcoming and helpful.  I highly recommend booking with Lindsay."
,,,,,,,,Place was just as described! Highly recommend. Thanks.
,,,,,,,,"I didn't get much time to see the neighborhood and city but Lindsay's apartment was a charming place to stay. It was easy to find and had a lot of little shops and restaurants near by (within walking distance). It was perfect for the one night I spent there, comfortable, and very clean."
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I just needed a place to sleep after a late-night arrival to Austin, and Lindsay's place was just what we needed. Clean, cozy, and affordable. It's got a bed, a sofa, a TV with steaming options, bathroom, kitchenette, A/C, and a parking space in a quiet, older apartment complex. Would definitely recommend for two travelers."
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I recently spent the night in Austin when we traveled there to see a concert. For our very first Airbnb experience, we spent the night in Lindsay's apartment - and the stay was a great one. The apartment was very clean, cool and had all of the amenities to meet our needs and make us feel comfortable. Check-in was extremely easy, and Lindsay was very responsive when I texted her with a couple convenience questions I had. Within the apartment, Lindsay provided an instruction packet that contained everything necessary to be able navigate electronics and all other aspects of the apartment, as well as to navigate around the immediate vicinity and Austin. The apartment is located in a very nice area, and through information listed in Lindsay's packet, I was able to download the ""Lyft"" transportation (taxi) app which came with free introductory rides and was extremely convenient and quick. Basically we were able to get around Austin quickly and without charge during our stay thanks to Lindsay's thoughtful and thorough stewardship. Overall, a lovely stay. I would say that Lindsay has certainly set the bar high for our future Airbnb experiences!  "
,,,,,,,,Had a great night at Lindsay's place in Austin! Perfect location is an easily walkable distance to numerous restaurants and grocery store. 
,,,,,,,,Lindsay's place was in a good location and was very clean. She was helpful and accommodating! 
,,,,,,,,The stay was great and the accomodations could have been more clean and what I expected. Lindsay was a great host! 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was super kind, helpful, and extremely prepared on all fronts. "
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was in a great part of town!  It was clean and well appointed.  Definitely an older building,  but it was so charming."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was perfect for one person and would be fine for two as well, cozy but had everything I needed! The location is also great, close to everything and a nice neighborhood--just note that it is on a hill that isn't obvious on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps so walking downtown (especially in the current heat) will be a little more strenuous than it looks. But otherwise it was perfect and Lindsay was great to communicate with, totally recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was awesome! The neighborhood was cute and we loved exploring the Clarksville area. Lindsay was so easy to work with and communicated all details so well. She also gave so many personal tips on what to do in the area and Austin that made it feel like a friend was telling us what we should check out. The apartment was cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed to have a great weekend. 

We will definitely be airbnb'ing again! :)
Alexis"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was awesome. Small but cozy, perfect for 2 people. Check-in process was easy. And we walked to downtown 6th street. It's not a bad walk if you like to walk. Off-street parking was a plus for us. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a good host she contacted me prior to our arrival and let me know all the details. She even told me that the apartment was ready early, which is great if you are in the city already. The apartment itself was clean, but had some quirks, such as the fact that you had to be careful about how many electronics and appliances were plugged in at once or the circuit would blow. The apartment also only has two prong plugs (Lindsay provided adapters for three prong) which are not grounded. It is what you think of as someone's first apartment. Overall if you are looking for a place to sleep it will work for you."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host. She was responsive at all times, even in the late night when we had a question. 

Her apartment was quaint and located in the cutest neighborhood. We were only a few blocks away from great restaurants. I highly recommend Josephines House for brunch!

The place was clean and had everything we needed. However if you like a new modern place, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for an apt with true Austin charm this is it!



 "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was very clean and fit 3 of us perfectly. We also got some great local bar and restaurant reservations from Lindsay that made our trip even better. The apartment is located in a really nice neighborhood, and walking distance to many shops and restaurants. We ended up taking Lyft and Uber all over Austin and found that the rides to most neighborhoods we went to were all under $10 from Lindsay's apartment. Thank you Lindsay for a great trip! We cannot wait to come back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was great. The apartment was VERY clean and the bed was comfortable. Close enough to all the action but in a quiet area where you can retreat from everything. Thanks, Lindsay!"
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I needed a place to crash after a fun and exhausting weekend at Jazzfest.  The home was  clean and fully equipped with all the basics, great place to hang and relax.  Parking was easy and shops close by--would recommend."
,,,,,,,,Host was great. Apartment was clean. Half-hour walk from sixth.
,,,,,,,,Lindsay was very receptive and accommodating - even provided early check in.  The apartment was cute and clean and in a nice/quiet neighborhood. 
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location near downtown Austin, walkable to 6th St, Pease Park & UT campus. Lindsay had good communication with me leading up to the weekend, and the apartment was well stocked with everything we needed (linens, paper towels, kitchenware, tea, even, uh... Pez!). I especially liked the welcome notes left on the counter: it gave me plenty of ideas for next time I'm in town. My only regret is not being able to stay longer. I would definitely consider staying here again."
,,,,,,,,"This was a cute place to stay!  Very comfortable and nice.  Agree that it is more suited to 2 people comfortably, 4 might be a little tough but it depends on how close you are.  :)  It was super clean.  I love (long) hot showers and sadly, the water got cold a little earlier than I'd have liked, but it was still great.  As for walking, the location was great, though the distance to things was a little further than I thought.  All of these are just things to keep in mind, but don't let them deter you from staying here!!  "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great first airbnb experience at this apartment, which features a lovely front courtyard and nice quiet building. The location is terrific; a short walk through a pretty neighborhood takes you to Austin Java, and a bit further south on Lamar are other treasures.  Lindsay helped make our stay easy; she checked in a few days before our trip, sent a detailed text with all the information we'd need around the time we were departing, and was available by text. It was evident that thought and care went into keeping the apartment tidy and ready for guests, with niceties like a variety of coffee and tea on hand,  clean soft sheets, and a ""crib sheet"" with things to do in town and the wifi password. I liked that there was enough room to do a little yoga in the mornings, and refillable pods for the Keurig coffee maker (how cool!) One observation: parking in the designated space is a bit tight, so guests might take this into account when choosing a rental car. We had no problem but a larger vehicle might have to go on the street (on which there is also plenty of free parking, so no problem!) Thanks, Lindsay! We hope to be back!!"
,,,,,,,,"Cute neighborhood, not far from UT and Downtown. Apartment was as pictured and Lindsay was very responsive.  She even texted me when the place was ready before Check-In time when she knew I was in town!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was awesome! Although we never saw her, she was extremely easy to communicate with and made our first airbnb experience a breeze. Finding the apartment was easy. Lindays's place was clean and cozy. She left us fresh linens, toiletries, tea, coffee, and an extensive list of fun things to do in the area. The apartment is in a neighborhood less than 10 minutes from pretty much everything. It is a first floor unit so it was a little noisy but nothing overly noticeable or uncomfortable! Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a home base to explore Austin from! "
,,,,,,,,This was our first AirBnB experience- and it was lovely! It was last minute and we were arriving late- Lindsay was very accommodating and made the process very easy for us. It is a cute little place and we are definitely adding it to our favorites whenever we may need a place to stay downtown in the future! Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host and accommodated us at the last minute as we were driving to Austin. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. The location couldn't be beat as we could walk just about anywhere (6th st, downtown, cafe Medici). Check in and check out were simple. Overall a great experience and I would recommend it for anyone."
,,,,,,,,Very cute apartment. The shower was a little tricky and felt like it might break at any moment. Lindsay was very sweet and the location is great! I don't think four people could stay here but it was great for 2! 
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at Lindsay's place. The place was exactly as described.  The neighborhood was quiet and there was a few restaurant within walking distance. 6th street, as well as Austin attractions, were a very short uber ride. Lindsay made herself available by text. We had such a great time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,This place was great! A single bedroom apartment within walking distance of downtown. I would rent again.
,,,,,,,,"This was my first airbnb experience and I really liked it.
Lindsay have given me very accurate instructions for the check-in so, even though we arrived a bit late, it was smooth check-in. We settled quickly, had a quick shower and walk downtown to have night out, diner and drinks on 6th street.
The house was very well prepared and we didn't miss a thing, it is very cozy and comfortable to sleep in. The neighborhood is quiet and located in a little hill so views are really nice, just 30 minutes walk to downtown. In addition to all this, you can park your car on the street or there is a parking spot assigned within a few yards reach from the house.
In the morning, we had a nice coffee and leave for a jog in a near by park. Then back, a shower and ready to go.
It won't be the last airbnb :)."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a wonderful host! Her apartment is exactly as described and in such an awesome location. The neighborhood is welcoming and very quiet. This isn't a party place, if that's what you're looking for. Upon arrival, Lindsay made it easy to check-in and even included information on local things to do, discounts and deals. The apartment was stocked with everything a person would need for a weekend and then some! She made my first airbnb experience wonderful. Thank you! "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was adorable and had everything I needed. The neighborhood was ideal for getting around anywhere and very safe. As a coffee lover, I appreciated having Medici coffee just up the road! The only thing I didn't realize was that it is on the first floor of a small apartment complex and is not a stand-alone house, so sometimes foot traffic by the front door gets a little noisy. Other than that, it was great. Thanks Lindsay for a wonderful stay in Austin!!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great time staying at Lindsay's place in Austin. We needed a central base from which we could explore the city so this was perfect! Lindsay sent detailed instructions on how and when we could get into the apartment so everything went smoothly. There were three of us staying so she had very kindly made up the airmatress for us which meant it was completely hassle free. Would definitely recommend it! 
,,,,,,,,Great location and a really cute little apartment. I stayed just one night with 2 friends and it was perfect. Easy check in and out and Lindsay was available by text if we needed anything. I would definitely stay there again! Thanks Lindsay! 
,,,,,,,,"The flat is in a great area - nice quiet neighbourhood near many cool places. It's a very cute little place that would be perfect for two people. For three, it felt a little small and intimate - the second bed goes in the living room so there is not much space to walk around or any privacy. Lindsay was great and efficient."
,,,,,,,,"Great Location!  We had a fantastic time staying at this place.  It was tucked away in a quiet neighborhood, but at the same time it was so close to everything.  The host was so gracious about ovulate check in and check out times, which made the experience even better!"
,,,,,,,,Very comfy and nice place
,,,,,,,,Lindsay was very welcoming and flexible.  Space was as advertised.  Quiet and convenient neighborhood if you're doing anything in downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Great first airbnb experience. The studio apartment was perfect for two people.  The location was great!! Every place we wanted to go was about a 3 mile radius.  I love that we were provided coffee,  good quality shampoo and conditioner and other amenities! Host was very responsive and friendly.  Apartment was clean and cozy.  The bed was soft and comfy too! I will definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was great, and just as described! We were only there for a night, but Lindsay had everything we needed and then some, and made sure everything was taken care of. Pleasant stay, and great neighborhood -- wish we'd had more time to take advantage of it all."
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Great experience! This is a sweet little apartment with all you might need to kick back and relax on vacation. 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay is a wonderful and welcoming host. The apartment is cozy and adorable. The location is fantastic. What more can I say? I'm looking for reasons to visit Austin so I can stay here,"
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent stay at Lindsay's apartment. It had everything we needed and was in a very cute part of town. Lindsay was also very communicative and made the arrival process as smooth as possible. 

Thank you so much!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was clean, adorable, and equipped with everything I needed. As described, within walking distance and in charming Clarksville. She was communicative and accommodating. Because it was an apartment complex, there was some noise from the neighbors (children mostly) but this was distracting, but added to the quaint feel of the place. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host.  The apartment was nice and clean.  It's located in a very cute neighborhood and I enjoyed my short walk to whole foods.  The neighbors were nice and friendly.  Even though I only stayed a day, I could totally picture myself living here!"
,,,,,,,,Lindsay was very communicative and welcoming. All the details were simply and straightforwardly described. The apartment was adorable and a simple 5 minute walk to 6th street. Loved it!
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay made herself available to us and was communicative throughout the trip. The accommodations were as advertised, with nice touches (Starbucks coffee available, first aid kit, etc) that made it feel more homey than a hotel."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was friendly, quick to answer our questions, and seemed genuinely interested in making sure everything went smoothly.  When we first arrived, the check in process was easy and the apartment was clean and comfortable.  We had a great time staying in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I spent three nights at this lovely apartment, located in the Clarksville neighborhood just West of Downtown Austin. It's close to the W. 6th St (good coffee shops/stores there), a pedestrian bridge to the South Austin areas, and just a few walking blocks from the city center. We were surprised how we could walk to literally everything. Apartment was perfect for sleeping or resting a bit in between adventures. Didn't get to meet Lindsay but she was attentive to text message, and left a pile of information about what to do and see around town. Would love to rent again in the future when there's better weather and take advantage of the spot's location to the Colorado River and Barton Springs."
,,,,,,,,"Great little place close to everything. Perfect for my husband and I to explore Austin. Great neighborhood, too! Would love to live around there. Lindsay had great recommendations and had great instructions about the apartment and things nearby."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay did a great job communicating with me leading up to my arrival.  The apartment was cozy, clean and stocked with information about the neighborhood and Austin in general.  I would stay here again.  Clarksville is great!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was cozy and well suited to what I was looking for. It's close to a lot of sights and restaurants, and definitely in the path of Uber and Lyft drivers. Initially I had a bit of a lag in response time regarding some questions I had about checking in, but once I was in town communication was good and Lindsay was very friendly and helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great little space in a quiet neighborhood. The bed was very comfy and the kitchen was accomodating. We walked just two blocks down and had dinner at the little Italian restaurant and stopped in the grocery store for some late night chocolate treats. The area is also close to downtown, which was very convenient. Also, we asked Lindsay if we could check in early and she was able to go out of her way to make the space ready for us so we could check in ahead of time. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was in a great area. We felt very at home even though we had never been to Austin before! The place is easy to get to and the perfect size for a couple! It was very clean and organized! The city is just a short 10 min Uber ride away. Everything went smoothly and Lindsay was always just a text away. Thank you!

P.S. Walk over to Lynn and 12th st for some fantastic Mexican food at Zocalo Cafe and milkshakes across the street!"
,,,,,,,,Had a great trip. Everything was as described. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,Lindsay was very responsive which made booking and checking in very easy. The location is easy access to the West side of Austin. Great tiny kitchen that is well outfitted. Bedroom/bathroom are a bit dim but still very clean and cozy. 
,,,,,,,,"Small place, but nice and in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown. Lindsay was a courteous hostess. We had a good trip without any issues."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was very accommodating and easy to get ahold of. Though we did not meet in person, she seemed very nice. This was my wife and my first airbnb experience and it was a great one. Theres no way we could have gotten a nice little 1 bed 1 bath apartment that close to the city any other way. Though it was not in the middle of downtown, we were still able to walk to 6th and Rainey streets where all the night life is. Clarksville is a really nice area though in and of itself.  Definitely would recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's apartment was perfect and just what I needed for a night's stay in Austin. It was conveniently located in a cute neighborhood that was walking distance to many shops and restaurants, and was the perfect place to catch a good night's sleep. I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a place to stay."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host, great communication yet not intrusive at all.  The apartment was exactly as described and convenient to Zilker park for ACL.  Nice safe neighborhood, comfy clean place to stay.  Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,Quiet little apartment near where I needed it to be...
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was an amazing host. She was very accommodating and allowed us to check in a little early. The apartment was very cozy and she provided clean towels, toiletries, and Netflix! Her apartment is about a 10 minute drive to East 6th Street which is very convenient.  She checked up on us from time to time and also provided a master list of things to do in Austin. All the rooms were clean and well kept. The neighborhood itself was really safe and we walked back home on a few nights. Uber and Lyft are always just minutes away if needed.  Overall, great experience, 5 out of 5 stars. "
,,,,,,,,"Clean, functional unit in quiet neighborhood with easy logistics."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay. Walking distance to all the sites in downtown austin. We will stay here again on our next trip to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Great visit and location. Really enjoyed the spot and time at Lindsay's. 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's apartment is very well located, close to downtown and about 15 minutes by bus from the University of Texas. But the space is smaller than we imagined it would be from the pictures,  and the furnitures shoud be improved. The price is too high and, for our second week, Lindsay beeing an attentive and accommodating host, agreed to allow us to continue our stay at a discounted price. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay went out of her way to accommodate us on our trip. She was responsive and accessible, and even put together little toiletry kits for us. She was an excellent host. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect location. Vintage Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was an excellent host from the start. Communicative, thoughtful, and flexible when I needed to add a night, she is a wonderful hostess. "
,,,,,,,,"We loved this cute apartment!! My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights with our little 11 month old son and the apartment was perfect. The location was ideal for us, we walked to cafes/restaurants near by for breakfast, to a park for playing and then pretty much everywhere else. 
The location is great! Very quiet apartment. AC was perfect for those warm Austin nights. Having WholeFoods so close was a definite plus as well. We will be recommending this place to any friends that visit Austin and will definitely consider it for future visits. 
Lindsay was helpful and easy to reach when needed as well. "
,,,,,,,,Lindsay's apartment was perfect for our weekend in Austin! It's cozy and in a nice and quiet area walking distance (or a cheap cab/lyft) to 6th street and all the action. I'll definitely look to stay here again during my next visit to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was as advertised and Lindsay was great, as other reviews show. The apartment on the ground floor is well spaced and within walking distance of most of what we needed. Lindsay is communicable, accessible and had a great to-do list for us. She also accommodated our late check-in with no hassle... Would highly recommend for a short term stay."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was great with communication. Clarksville is a great neighborhood, close to downtown, South Congress and the University of Texas. I was able to take a workout class in South Lamar, pick up breakfast at Whole Foods on Lamar, and attend a UT graduation all without the hassle of traffic. The apartment isn't new but it has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Plenty of clean towels and linens. Clean kitchen, a TV with Netflix. The place is small so I would only recommend two people stay here. 

I would definitely stay here again, based on location alone. "
,,,,,,,,"Very charming apartment, very clean and convenient to everything. It's nice to have small touches like a guest book when traveling and am happy when hosts have things like that to get in the spirit of traveling. Great first airbnb experience! "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a nice host! She was flexible in regards to our check-in/out times and made we felt comfortable reaching out to her if we needed anything. 

The apartment  was clean, with fresh towels and linens, and a kitchen full of dishes if you chose to cook there. The size of the apartment works well for a couple, though there is a couch in the living room that a 3rd person could stay on. The apartment is nothing fancy, but it works perfectly for people who are just looking for a clean, safe place to crash at night. The tv in the bedroom with Netflix was a nice touch and this is random, but the water pressure in the shower is perfect.

It's also a nice distance from good places to explore. The neighborhood is quiet and cute and a nice walk from Caffee Medici and a grocery store a few blocks away. It's about a 15/20 minute walk down to the more affordable parts of 6th street. 

All in all, my husband and I would stay here again. It's a good apartment for a good price."
,,,,,,,,"The place is in a great location, a beautiful safe neighborhood that we loved exploring! Lin's apartment is just as advertised, small and basic, but great for two people. The weather was really warm but the fans keep the place really cool. The linens were all nice and fresh and clean and the apartment itself clean although a little on the older side.
We didn't meet Lin but organizing to get in and out was easy enough and the notes she left about the neighborhood, transport and attractions were really helpful. The only thing I would note is that the bed is well loved and quite squeaky to get in and out of - however it is very comfortable when you are in!
"
,,,,,,,,I had a great experience at the apartment which is in a great location. I never met Lindsay but she was easily contactable. Would definitely recommend her place for a stay in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"My brother, sister, and I really enjoyed the cozy apartment. It was a perfect place for us to crash. We liked the neighborhood too! It was a nice walk to 6th street and we also found nice places for coffee and brunch a few blocks away!"
,,,,,,,,"I have both pros and cons about Lindsay's place. 

First the pros: It's in a great location for touring Austin. Easily walkable to the groovy downtown area. In a car it's easy to get anywhere in Austin in minutes. It's close to Whole Foods and many other great Austin stores and bars. Never a problem with street parking and there's also a private parking slot in the rear. It's very affordable for having an entire apt. to yourself. Perfect for the budget-minded person. Lindsay was very responsive in all of our communications.

Cons: It's a noisy, not well sound-insulated, older apartment building. Noise from the neighbors upstairs comes right through the ceiling. The apartment itself felt a little run down. I might be spoiled by my other Airbnb experiences, but the feeling of ambiance was seriously lacking. The apt. is furnished in the least expensive way possible (Goodwill maybe), including towels, furniture, decor and paint job. It's great if you're JUST looking for a place to crash and don't care about anything else. But, if you're looking for nice surroundings in a place to stay, I'd suggest spending a bit more money and looking elsewhere."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay and I never met in person, but she was solicitous and would, I am sure, have rallied around if I had needed her for any reason.  Her place is simple, clean and very well-located in an interesting and walkable neighborhood with stores and services and its very own moon tower!  I would happily stay there again.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great location in the middle of everything in Austin! Lindsay was a great host, checking in if anything was needed and being very attentive with our needs! "
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! Perfect location in Austin , I would definitely come back again!"
,,,,,,,,Lindsay made everything worry-free from the get-go! She arranged beautiful red roses for us since it was Valentine's weekend and made sure we were well-situated. The big tv at the foot of the bed was a nice treat in the morning after a long night. Would definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,Lindsay's place was great! It was easy to walk to everything I wanted to do while I was in Austin and she was very sweet. She had a lot of tips and advice about Austin and checked in several times with me throughout the visit. Checking in and out was also super easy.
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"This is a nice, small apartment. Perfect for a short stay in Austin. It is conveniently located - I appreciated being able to walk easily to 6th St. Lindsay is a great host and responded promptly to all my messages."
,,,,,,,,"I loved Lindsay""s place.  It was clean and cute.  The location was great--the street was in a nice neighborhood and it was very quiet.  Comfy bed and good TV/movie viewing.  Lindsey even dropped off extra towels and blankets!  It is on the small side so perfect for two people.  I would stay there again.
Thanks Lindsay!"
,,,,,,,,"A nice little apartment in a good location. We had fun. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen well equipped. Short walk to many restaurants and shops. 
I did provide the owner some feedback about small things that could have made our stay better, such as nice towels and two barstools so that we could eat at the counter together. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was Awesome. She accommodated our late late check in (12am). She had great tips for us round town. Also very fast to reply. Room was great, clean, and really easy to get to the bus sup/walk to 6th. High Recommended! "
,,,,,,,,Lindsay was easy to deal with and the accommodation is literally a 15 min walk from all the action on to 6th street with bars as close as 10 mins. It's a good location from which to base your stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Nice apartment in a nice part of town.  I rented a car to get to meetings at UT, but could have taken the bus.  6th street is walking distance.  Would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,I loved my stay in Austin.  The apartment was clean and located in such a fun neighborhood.  My only regret was not having more time.  The place was centrally located and close to a great coffee shop called Caffe Medici!  Lindsay was great at giving clear instructions on the apartment and regularly checked in via text during my stay.
,,,,,,,,"I was in town for ACL and needed a place close to downtown Austin to get away from some of the craziness of staying with my friends. Lindsay was quick to respond, very informative and super helpful.

The place was more than enough for myself, but looks like it could sleep 2-3 people comfortably, it's clean and cozy.

Lindsay's the nicest, next time I'm out that way I wouldn't hesitate to look up again!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay for a few days while I was in town for a conference. I enjoyed the convenience of being near Lamar & 6th as well as a few neighborhood restaurants and stores. The apartment is clean and comfortable, and it had everything I needed to prepare for work and play."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in a great location.  Lindsay was great.
,,,,,,,,"Great location and a very charming apartment. I was here for a week on business and found the apartment and location to have everything I needed to make my stay in Austin to be truly memorable. Would highly recommend. 

"
,,,,,,,,"Cute apartment with a quaint feel.  Good location; easy to find.  Super quiet neighborhood, which I fully appreciated.  Lindsay was very accommodating and a lovely person to deal with."
,,,,,,,,"Very helpful in making a last minute booking! Clean and organized! Also, conveniently close to down town ! Quick to keep you informed and attentive! 

"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's apartment was perfect! Great location, and the off street parking was super convenient. Everything was clean and comfortable. We will definitely be staying with Lindsay on our next trip to Austin! :)"
,,,,,,,,"Clean, comfortable, and good location since we met friends in downtown. We enjoyed the little touches like wifi, parking, and Netflix and also being 10 minutes by walking from Amy's ice cream. Everything worked as stated, and Lindsay was solid at communicating with us."
,,,,,,,,"My two friends and I stayed in Lindsay's cozy, humble apartment, which was perfect for our travel needs. We had originally planned to stay only one night, but liked the city so much, we added another day to our trip!  Lindsay made every effort to make sure our needs were met, and was very open in communicating via texts before and during our stay.  When we had an unexpected problem with the bathroom door lock, she immediately offered to come over and help us get it unjammed- bringing her friend and a toolbox to solve the problem.  I'd say that's going the extra mile!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great apartment in a lovely neighborhood. Near to a grocery store and a short walk into town. Lindsay is lovely, a great host and made sure I had everything I needed for an enjoyable trip over from the UK. I would highly recommend staying here and will stay again the next time I'm in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The space was the perfect size for two people for the long weekend (says you can accommodate up to 4, but that may be a bit cramped for your liking). The apartment was quiet, the neighbors were friendly, and the surrounding area was safe. We used the wi-fi, but not the television & netflix, but it all worked safely and without hassle. There were plenty of towels, blankets, cups/plates, and really any amenity needed for the kitchen and bathroom. 

We were within walking distance to west 6th bars and restaurants, close to the bus line, and grocery/convenience stores were a quick ride away. We didn't meet Lindsay, but she was accommodating to our late arrival and was flexible when we left the apartment. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's apartment is lovely, homely and comfortable in a charming, quiet neighborhood. She was very accommodating and we really enjoyed our stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is very quaint and super cool. Lindsay is a cordial and wonderful host and everything about our stay and our trip was wonderful.
We will stay here again... Perfect!!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a perfect host. She responded quickly and professionally to all our questions/requests.  We will definetly be contacting her for other stays in Austin. We truly enjoyed our stay as everthing was simple and hassle free. 


"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great hostess.  There was frequent communication, before, during & after our stay, and she always responded in a timely manner.  Apt was cute & private.  She left us notes about area attractions and recommendations for first-time Austin visitors.  I would definitely stay here again.  Free parking behind the apt complex was an added benefit; lots of places to eat, drink & shop within walking distance."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, comfortable stay, friendly host.  Couldn't ask for much more than that! "
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was great, even if we didn't get a chance to meet. She was super responsive via text and email. And was willing to adjust the  checkin/checkout times to match up with my odd flight times. The apartment was clean, quiet and cozy. The AC really came in handy a couple of days! Plus, just a short walk from a few great restaurants and shops...a neat neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,"Thanks to car2go, Lindsay's place didn't feel too far from downtown Austin. It had everything we needed for a quick couple days exploring Austin. She even left us a snack and supplies to help us enjoy the town. Be sure to check out the bats under the South Congress bridge at dusk!"
,,,,,,,,"Cute and comfortable apartment, great location (my favorite neighborhood in Austin). Lindsay was very helpful- she checked in as soon as I arrived to see if I needed anything. I felt very comfortable throughout my stay and would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a pleasure to deal with from the second I booked all the way through the minute I left. Super flexible with my weird travel plans and very helpful. The unit is in a great location in a very upscale neighborhood... safety, cleanliness, and proximity are no worries here. She even had a bike available to use which I used to get EVERYWHERE, it proved invaluable. I would have no problem booking this location again on return travels to Austin, which I plan on doing because it's a great city."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in a great location and Lindsay is a great host, very responsive and very easy to get the key and eventually check out. It's very easy to walk to 6th st or downtown from her apartment and Zilker park is pretty close as well."
,,,,,,,,"Great cozy apartment with all the basic amenities including kitchenette. Fantastic location, in a great quiet neighborhood that's easily walkable from Downtown. Lindsay was accommodating and helpful, I had no problems but she was very responsive. Notably fast internet was a nice touch. Ideal for a young solo traveler or couple."
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay was a great host. Although my girlfriend and I never met her, we found her listing to be clean and accommodating. We took a really nice walk to the UT campus and downtown area. If we're ever up in Austin again, we'd definitely stay at her place. Thanks for everything Lindsay!"
,,,,,,,,Great location close to campus and Lindsay made the experience very easy.  Would stay again! 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay's place was very clean, great location. And, would certainly stay here again in the future.

Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay is very accommodating and the apartment is very charming. Everything was clean, and would certainly stay here again.
Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Very cute apartment, walking distance to everything.  Lindsay is very pleasant and helpful.  A great stay"
,,,,,,,,"If you're in your 20s, traveling alone, and spending a weekend in Austin, Lindsay's place works well. It's pretty basic, but comfortable. Lindsay wanted me to feel welcome and enjoy Austin; she was friendly, easy to get in touch with, offered tips on what to do, and invited me to join her in activities. I appreciated the effort she made as a host, she had snacks and coffee for me, provided plenty of shampoo, soap, towels, etc. Her place has wifi and netflix, which is a nice touch. She even let me use her bike, which was a much appreciated perk! 

As I said above, if you're traveling solo, it's a good fit. I wouldn't recommend using it for entertaining friends as it is a fairly basic apartment. The location worked well for me to walk (or bike) into downtown Austin. "
1724256,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This place if what airbnb is all about to me, a great location with a great host. James was there to welcome us, showed us around and pointed out the houses features. Told us he would drive back 40 mins from where he was staying if we needed anything. There was no need, the location is so good we walked everywhere, to local parks, to restaurants to downtown Austin (starting to get a bit hot for that walk though!).  All in all a great experience."
,,,,,,,,"James was such a great host. We had a group traveling for business and he was super helpful, very communicative, and great to work with. Our folks loved his place and hope to book it again next year!
"
,,,,,,,,"James was a great host and his house is a great house. Clean, perfect location, and very comfortable. James even left us cookies and fresh flowers! Would definitely stay here."
,,,,,,,,"James was an amazing host and extremely conscientious. The house was comfortable and spotless, and a perfect place to stay for the conference. Proximity to B-Cycle made this a no-brainier. We would absolutely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Great spot. Lovely yard, home is very well kept, easily walkable to Auditorium Shores and Zilker park. "
,,,,,,,,This place was amazing and contained everything you would need for a short weekend break in Austin.  Only a 10 minute walk to downtown - so we did not even need to get a taxi to get round.  Location is excellent and communication from the host was prompt and accurate.  I would stay here again when in Austin (which is an amazing city!)
,,,,,,,,"JamesÂ´ place was perfect, super comfortable, beautiful and clean. The location was really good, very close to Zilker Park in a quiet and charming neighborhood. We stayed there for the ACL festival which is a short walk from the house. I highly recommend JamesÂ´ place, we felt at home, and he was a great host! Thank you again!"
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I stayed at James' place for the ACL festival. The house was a short walk to the grounds and absolutely perfect for our needs. He was a great host, his house is gorgeous, clean and sunny. Highly recommended! We would definitely stay at James' place again in the future. If you are planning a trip to Austin, this is definitely the place for you. "
,,,,,,,,"Thank you so much James for a wonderful stay. Your home was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The central location was perfect and allowed us to get everywhere without a car. Would recommend your home to others. Thanks again!
Michele "
,,,,,,,,"We loved being in James' home.  It is clean, outfitting with everything one could think of, is proximate and walking distance to everything we wanted to see and to access, it is comfortable and the neighborhood is idyllic.

As a 'landlord' James was accessible and a warm and easy going communicator.  He referred several freelance staffers our way and they were phenomenal.  I can't recommend James' house enough-and next time we are in Austin, his is the first outreach we will make.

A+++++

11400538,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Great stay! Awesome host and outgoing city! 
,,,,,,,,Suzanne's place was just what we needed for a quick weekend in Austin. Great location & perfect for what we were looking for.
,,,,,,,,"The location is great and perfect for getting to downtown, the park, and the Clarksville area is wonderful in itself. Suzanne was extremely helpful and great with communication. The bed was on the harder side but overall this met our needs and we had a nice stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Suzanne was a fantastic host! She was very helpful and flexible. She met with us right after we have arrived. She gave us a lot of information about Austin and places that we might be interested in. We could text her anytime and she would always be nice and helpful. The place is very cozy, great located with a walking distance to downtown. Neighborhood is safe and very beautiful. We really enjoyed her hospitality and next time we are in Austin, we will be seeing if she is available. Definitely reccomended! "
,,,,,,,,"Suzanne is the best host you could hope for. Ready to give you advice on the best places to go to and eager to make your stay the best possible. Her apartment is an absolute jewel, beautifully decorated and walking distance for downtown Austin.
Unfortunately I had to cut my stay short but if I ever have the chance to go back to Austin, Suzanne's place is the perfect spot to stay at!"
,,,,,,,,Great little place to stay in Austin! Close to everything and clean and quiet! Loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing your home! 
,,,,,,,,"rented Suzannes lovely place for Sxsw, it was perfect ! walking distance if you are up for it or a short Uber ride if not ."

961883,4.5,10,10,9,10,10,9,"Raquel and Jacob are very responsive and proactive about communicating. This loft is tasteful, spacious and functional. If your work takes you to downtown Austin, or if you want to just unwind for a few days, you could do a lot worse than this place."
,,,,,,,,This place was fantastic. Great view of the capital and a great location to walk anywhere down by congress or 6th! Highly recommend 
,,,,,,,,Raquel and Jacob were great hosts. They provided really easy to follow instructions and communicated with us quickly whenever we had a question. The home itself was really neat and tidy and just a walk away from anywhere we wanted to go in downtown. Thank you again for being awesome hosts for our group!
,,,,,,,,"Nothing wrong with this place, just note that the entrance is right on the street. The glaring windows in the photos are old shades mostly covering the views of HVAC units, and you're told to take your trash to the dump, remove the sheets and pillow cases and towels, and wipe all the counters or lose your deposit. Oh, and if you set the thermostat outside of the range they give you, you'll lose your deposit for that, too.  Very nice. Very well run and convenient if you need this location. Wish I had dug a little deeper before booking this one."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, awesome apartment. Raquel and Jacob were always available and did everything possible to accommodate my early check-in. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Great location and perfect size for my fiancÃ©e and I. Rachel and Jacob were great hosts and we look forward to future trips to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"The arrival to Raquel's place in Austin was very easy. The location can't be beat for walking into downtown or the capitol or even the university. The apartment is small but cozy, typical city living. It was comfortable for 3 girls to stay. The shower is a bit small but it gets the job done! Just be aware that you can hear noise inside at night so just keep that in if you are a light sleeper. They did have a noise machine which was helpful. Loved the sound system with cassette tapes :) Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely return if we were to come to Austin again! "
,,,,,,,,"The location is great, easy walking distance of pretty much everywhere you want to go in Austin. Communication was great, Raquel and Jacob are always very quick to respond and answered all our questions helpfully. The check in/out process was completely self sufficient and painless, definitely recommended!"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment and a really good booking experience 
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic, safe location, a short walk or cab ride from pretty much anything downtown! Perfect for a business trip when you don't want to stay in a hotel and need your own space!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. Great location and the place was very nice. Raquel and Jake were always quick to respond. I would stay there again. Five stars!
,,,,,,,,Great location and Raquel & Jacob were quick to reply to messages. Everything was as described. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,Great location. Close to everything but on a quiet street.  Clean.  Simple.  Great host communication.  Good value.
,,,,,,,,Excellent communications and were very accurate about the lost and location. Would certainly stay again and would recommend it to my friends.
,,,,,,,,"This was a great experience. Raquel and Jacob were very easy to get in touch with, quick with responses, super helpful with Austin info and overall some of the best hosts I've had on AirBNB. The location can't be beat if you're visiting Austin, there's so much to do! Would highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"The host made us feel very welcome.  The description of the place was very accurate.  The place was cute and clean.  There was some partying and things going on outside at 3AM that woke me up, but hey, it's downtown Austin!  :-)  "
,,,,,,,,Location was fantastic and the host was very responsive.  Some opportunities to improve.  I'm in Austin regularly for business and I plan to stay here again.  
,,,,,,,,"Right from the start, Raquel contacted me to make sure I had a smooth stay at the Airbnb. The space was clean, beautiful, and very well located! The view of the Capitol was right outside our windows! Many restaurants and bars are within walking distance! Sixth street is closer but we were even able to walk to Rainey street. Definitely would stay here again and recommend to others!"
,,,,,,,,Simple easy convenient
,,,,,,,,"The place was great. It's in the middle of everything, couldn't have asked for a better location. Definitely coming back!"
,,,,,,,,The place is great and the location cannot be beaten. Raquel was easy to get in touch with and really easy to work with. Definitely a recommended stay. 
,,,,,,,,This home is in an excellent location - walking distance from everything we wanted to do downtown.  The beds were extremely comfortable and the sound system is a nice touch.  This was our first time visiting Austin and we're glad we stayed here!
,,,,,,,,Hosts were super responsive the entire time.  Access was simple.  
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay at this Austin location. The place was cozy and comfortable, and the location was right in the heart of downtown. Raquel and Jacob were always accessible. I would definitely stay here again in the future. "
,,,,,,,,Raquel and Jacob were awesome hosts! They made sure we had everything we needed and were very willing to make us feel at home. I would definitely go back to Austin and stay with them again.
,,,,,,,,It was great to stay in this lovely house and the owners had the most useful i formation to get settled very easily and ready to enjoy Austin :)
,,,,,,,,"The location of the flat is perfect for visitors. Close to all amenities and attractions. Parking is just outside if you don't mind rolling it up every 3 hours which ended up being fine for us to do.

The flat itself is small but perfect for a couple of days. It was clean and tidy on arrival. We arrived early and were fortunate enough that no one else had stayed the night before so we got into the flat earlier.

Raquel was always quick to answer any emails. We had no issues with the lock like others have experienced so that was good.

There is no kettle or toaster just FYI for those wanting to have breakfast at home and we couldn't get the TV to work but this was OK as we were out most of the time. The bed is very soft which was an issue for me but many people like that and the air con was very noisy and kept waking us up through the night. Looking at what we paid for the accommodation I would have expected more. 

I would recommend this place for a short visit of 1-2 days. As I said though the hosts were very helpful with any questions. "
,,,,,,,,This is a great location for doing things downtown! I walked everywhere easily. The bed is comfy and the A/C was nice and cool after a long day of running around.
,,,,,,,,Location makes downtown adventures very easy. Great apartment would recommend to anyone wanting to visit the downtown area
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were great hosts. The apartment was exactly what we were looking for and had expected, and was furnished beautifully! They were very accommodating and checked in to make sure our stay was going well. "
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were extremely attentive via airbnb during the booking phase and super eager to assist with my one million questions, which was lovely. When we arrived at the apartment we had an issue with the lock code and tried calling the contact number provided, but no answer. It was a little disappointing as I had specifically addressed my concern with the lock box, especially since were arriving super late. While we called and texted the number, once I sent a message via airbnb (which is not super practical at midnight) we received the correct code. My boyfriend and I had to end our stay early due to finding a roach in our room, but Raquel and Jacob were understanding and refunded our last two nights with no questions asked. Other than that, the apartment is in a great location and would have served its purpose for our stay. "
,,,,,,,,"The hosts were in communication before and during the stay.  I had trouble with the keycode not working when I arrived, and the hosts immediately responded to my text and resolved the issue in about 15 minutes.

The apartment is basic (you're paying for location), but the hosts have provided some additional comforts such as soap and shampoo, hair dryer, ear plugs for light sleepers (there is a some traffic at night), Chromecast.

Wifi doesn't work very well in the bedroom."
,,,,,,,,Great location - walking distance to the Austin hot spots (6th Street & Rainy Street).  Really easy check-in/out situation.  Very fast email/text responses from the host when I had questions prior to arrival.
,,,,,,,,Nice little apartment. No problem finding and getting in. Wifi was iffy in parts of the apartment and that's the only real knock I have for them.
,,,,,,,,"Listing description was totally accurate, and you can't beat the location. You can see the capitol building right out the living room window.

Getting into the unit was tricky due to some weirdness with the lock, but Jacob resolved the issue quickly. It was smooth sailing from that point on.

The modest kitchen was better for a business traveler like myself than anyone who wants to stay in and cook, but with so many great options for eating downtown, it was never an issue for me.

The bedroom was very comfortable, and the place was quiet at night."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Raquel and Jacob's place in Austin. The loft is centrally located and it is easy to get around the city from there. There was a slight issue with cleaning when we arrived, but the hosts were very responsive and the problem as remedied quickly. Overall, a good experience. "
,,,,,,,,"On the plus side: Great location and awesome view of the capital building and quite spacious. 
On the negative side: bathroom a little old and outdated, 3 small towels for a 3 day stay (asked for more and owner was responsive). One cereal bowl and you have to clean dishes and empty trash when you leave. 

This was my first Airbnb experience. Price was only marginally less than hotel. Not sure I would do it again."
,,,,,,,,Excellent location and very cool apartment with easy parking and access. Thanks! 
,,,,,,,,"raquel and jacob have a lovely place in downtown austin. my colleagues and I came in to town for a three-day work conference, and the location of their home was perfect for our needs. they did a great job prepping for our visit--the space was clean, stocked with fresh sheets and towels, and their cork board with restaurant and nightlife suggestions really helped make our trip truly something special. would definitely recommend this airbnb for anyone coming in town and looking for some southern hospitality! bonus points for their wonderful selection of cassette tapes :) book this space!!"
,,,,,,,,We had so much fun in Austin and the condo was perfect in location and in size.   We walked everywhere.   I must say to future people that we came for the BBQ.   Stubbs the first night. Just okay.  Next day Franklins. And third day Terry Blacks.    By far Franklins.   Yes we waited but everyone in line were friendly and Franklins knows their customer service .    They brought us water and snacks.     Now the condo.  Clean. Cozy.  Comfortable.  I will say again Clean.   When ever we return to Austin.   This is the place to stay
,,,,,,,,The space was perfect for what we needed. It was cozy and in a great location. Raquel and Jacob were very helpful! 
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were amazing hosts! They were very accessible if we needed anything, and the apartment was exactly what we were looking for. Well equipped, clean and bright, and VERY close to all the things in Austin we wanted to check out. Pretty much everything was in walking/biking distance, and Raquel and Jacob had plenty of good suggestions for things to do. Overall it was the perfect stay and we highly recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,This is a sweet little hidden gem smack in the heart of downtown.  Totally recommended.  Its easy and just literally easy for everything !
,,,,,,,,"Raquel was a pleasure to work with and the apartment was great! The location was perfect for the Austin Marathon and it was close to everything we wanted to do downtown. There was plenty of space and amenities for our group of 4. While parking normally wouldn't have been an issue, the marathon caused most of the street parking to be unavailable all weekend, but we were able to find a pay lot 2 blocks away for pretty cheap, which worked really well for us. I highly recommend Raquel and this apartment and we hope to stay again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was lovely and wonderfully decorated. Very convenient to everything downtown. There were a few issues at the start of my stay, but Raquel+Jacob were very responsive and very helpful. 

I come to Austin for work and next time I come, I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Everything as described. Great quaint loft with very accessible location. Very convenient.
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were great hosts!  Everything was just as described, clean, and waking up to the view of the Capitol was amazing.  The location was on point, close to everything so you can walk, and the proximity to Franklins bbq was great.  Couldn't ask for more, and will definitely be coming back."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is really ideally located. We were attending the MLA annual conference and it was very easy to walk everywhere. The apartment is comfortable and cosy and has everything you need for a short stay. The door lock with a digicode is also extremely convenient, especially if you are with a group of people. Raquel and Jacob were always available and wanted to make sure that we had everything we need. "
,,,,,,,,Raquel and Jacob were great hosts! They were responsive and the unit was very clean. It is an older unit with character. It is walking distance from downtown. They have a detailed check-out process. 
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place. Excellent location in Austin with a view of the Capitol and close to lots of bars, cafes and restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,Listing is located steps from the Capitol building and a quick walk to the best restaurants and nightlife that Austin has to offer. Our party of 3 adults was comfortable. Host was responsive at all times before and during our stay. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place, fantastic location, easy access and a nice touch with the cassette deck :) Everything was fairly smooth and seamless from reservation to check-in to check-out. "
,,,,,,,,"Very nice, professional and responsive hosts...place is easy to find and check-in/-out...there is plenty of magazines with tips for Austin, tape cassettes (yes!) and kitchen utensils...decent view over the capitol building...walking distance to the 6th street...overall great."
,,,,,,,,Raquel and Jacob were great during our stay! They were always quick to respond and were willing to work with us when our plans were possibly going to change. The loft itself was nice with a queen bed and 2 day beds it was perfect for our group of 3 and could've even fit 1 more person comfortably. They provided plenty of towels and linens for us. We would definitely recommend staying here again!
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were wonderful hosts during our stay in Austin! Their communication was great - they checked in a few times during our stay to ask if we needed anything, and when I asked a question they were responded fast. The apartment itself is a great location if you want to be near 6th Street and/or the University of Texas at Austin. Far enough away from the bustle that sleeping through the night is easy, but close enough to walk almost everywhere. Uber is also convenient in Austin, so we didn't even rent a car for our stay. 

The master bed was really comfy, and the bathroom had ample counter space so that both my friend and I could primp at the same time. We didn't really use the twin daybeds, but we sat on them a few times and they seemed comfortable enough. We could also plug in an iPod to have music while we were lounging, which is always a nice touch.

I highly recommend staying at Raquel and Jacob's Historical Loft in Austin. It was a great home away from home!"
,,,,,,,,Great stay at Raquel and Jacob's place. Always very accommodating and easy to get in upon arrival. 
,,,,,,,,"We were very lucky to have stayed in the loft. Raquel and Jacob are professional, organized and respond very quickly to emails. The loft is beautiful, bright with lots of windows. Very comfortable. Close to our favorite places downtown and a quick drive away from everything else. Our top choice for next year's visit. "
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob have an adorable apartment in the perfect downtown Austin location and they provided a very detailed guide to the apartment and left excellent recommendations for the area. We had an issue with the electricity, but they responded and fixed the problem quickly, which was greatly appreciated. I highly recommend staying here if you're visiting downtown Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Loved the locations and the space.  Perfect for my week long work trip to Austin.  
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were excellent hosts. As first time AirBnB users, this couldn't have been a more perfect way for us to visit and see Austin. The location is perfect, the apartment is as described in the photos - no surprises, and we were able to see the entire city by foot over the weekend we were staying. We had some issues getting into the apartment initially (door code wasn't working) but Raquel and Jacob were quick to assist and everything was fixed/updated/working properly. As others have said, the people living in the unit below this one are a bit loud (music playing at 2AM) but I'm a very light sleeper, my husband, didn't hear anything. Certainly wouldn't keep us from coming back. Highly recommend, will defiantly come back!"
,,,,,,,,"Great area, The host made me feel welcome and I had a great stay."
,,,,,,,,The condo was really cute and in a great location. Raquel was great to deal with. The only problem is that there is a loud neighbor that seems to be awake all night. It's fine if you're not a light sleeper though.
,,,,,,,,We were only in Austin for a couple of days & Raquel & Jacob's place was perfect for our stay. So close to everything with coffee shops & restaurants right outside & what a pretty view of the Capital Building at dusk! The apartment is beautifully decorated & feels homely. If we return to Austin we would definitely love to stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob's place was perfect for what we needed.  Comfortable and cool, in a great location right downtown.  We really enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Location was great with a lovely view of the capitol.  We had a few issues with things when we got there and wish these were set-up/taken care of before we got there.  The host was not responsive for the first few hours, but later tried to resolve the problems through text.  It would have been helpful if they came to the apartment to take care of the issues rather than all the back and forth and having us bother another one of their tenants to coordinate a resolution.  The apartment itself is clean and well furnished.  The bathroom is very very small unfortunately.   One of the neighbors downstairs is extremely noisy, blasting EDM at 7AM.  We thought they were banging on our doors, but it was so loud that it was actually them banging on their own doors.  Just a few minor things that can be worked on other than that.  The location is probably worth it.  Thanks for the stay."
,,,,,,,,"This listing is too perfect. So cute and close to everything! My friends and I walked everywhere we needed to go. Huge bathroom with great lighting (always a plus). If it is available, STAY HERE! I recommend to any and all. "
,,,,,,,,The owners are very responsive to all of your requests and accommodating.  The place is clean and as described.  Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,I loved this place so much! So close to all the fun and an amazing view of the capital for sunset. They even have a great array of cassettes - my favorite personal touch. Hosts were extremely obliging and responsive when access code didn't work. Thank you both for hospitality and recommendations in area. I will only stay here when back in austin. 
,,,,,,,,"The host was incredibly responsive and welcoming. I had all of my questions answered and everything was made very clear before our visit. The apartment was very comfortable-- perfect for three of us traveling to Austin! It's located right downtown near the Capitol (a 10 minute walk to 6th street, too) with lots of parking. There were extra sheets and pillows provided in the closet (which came in handy as at least one of the sets on the bed we found to be used already). Everything else was wonderful. Would recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob own a great apartment that is centrally located; you can pretty much walk anywhere within 30mins. It has a great view too. Checking in was very easy and the hosts were very responsive to our needs. The wireless internet was weak at times and there was an incident at the apartment on our last day, but the hosts responded promptly. We love Austin and would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! Everything was very easy in terms of arranging our stay, and keyless entry made it super easy for a late night arrival. Excellent location - amazing views of the Capitol! - and a very comfortable place to stay. We were two friends staying, so used the bed in the bedroom and the day-bed in the lounge, and this worked perfectly. Thanks - would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was great, very comfortable and cozy, and easy to communicate with Raquel and Jacob. Fantastic view of the capitol dome! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Walking distance to bars and restaurants.
Apt is as described. No complains at all. 
Great spot if you are 2-3 people visiting Austin for couple days"
,,,,,,,,"This was the best AirBnB I have ever stayed in. Extremely cute apartment in a very central location, was able to walk to almost everything that I wanted to visit. Hosts provided information and suggestions on where to go in Austin which we used everyday. Highly suggest staying here. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was lovely and as described and pictured. Instructions were clear. The internet worked well. Very centrally located and easy to get to. Overall we had a great experience. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"We stayed there for about a month. Raquel and Jacob are great hosts, made us feel very welcomed. They answered our questions very quickly and when we had a couple of issues they did their best to fix them. 
The place itself is located right next to the Capitol and the heart of the downtown. It's probably not ideal for a family especially with small kids as it gets very noisy during the night - sirens, garbage trucks, drunk parties, noisy neighbor; so if you are a light sleeper you will find it hard to sleep at night and early morning.  
Location wise it's close to the Capitol and the 6th street with all the pubs if this is what you want, however if you don't have a car it's a bit hard to walk anywhere else with a pram. Bus stops are not far, the nearest Whole Foods Market is a good 20 minutes walk. 
Anyway, it's a great place to stay if you want to have fun and go to the pubs etc, probably not as much if you have young kids and if you need to cook for them."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome apartment and awesome location. Loved the close vicinity to so many things. Parking was easy, apartment was clean and had everything necessary for a comfortable stay."
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were very responsive before, during, and after the trip. That being said, there wasn't much I needed to contact them directly about--everything I needed was in the apartment manual--how to check-in and check-out, food recommendations, etc. It was really nice not to deal with unknowns during our first trip to Austin. We had a great time, and the apartment is in a lovely, safe location. Being close to the capitol building was great for the views, and it was a short (~15 min) walk to other sights (bars and restaurants) we wanted to visit. 

I would recommend the space to a couple or small group of friends--definitely folks you don't mind being in close quarters with, given that the bathroom is inside the main bedroom. That wasn't a problem at all for our group, but something to keep in mind for others interested in the space. "
,,,,,,,,"The pictures and description are all accurate. Raquel and Jacob are very nice and thorough. The loft is a spacious, beautiful place and in a great location. I would highly recommend this airbnb."
,,,,,,,,Very clean apartment with easy weekend parking and comfortable bed. Good value compared to hotel options. Great stay!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic stay! This was the perfect place for us to stay in Austin in the days leading up to our wedding, before we checked into a hotel with all of our guests. The location is fantastic, and the loft was exactly as described, and a very cute, fun, and comfortable place to stay. The daybed feature was especially great as it enabled my sister to stay with my fiancÃ© and I for a couple of nights. And Raquel and Jacob were fantastic hosts -- very organized and responsive. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were in touch quite often to tell me of each step in the process and walk me through.  This was my first experience with Airbnb, so I was very appreciative of their attention to detail and their willingness to answer all my questions.  They even provided additional photos when I asked about certain things.  Their check-in/check-out handbook was quite simple and easy to understand.  The door code provided worked the first time and every time after.  The condo In Austin was in a great location - just a few steps from the capitol, Congress street, great restaurants, and close enough to 6th street.  The condo was clean, just the right size, and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The shower is small, but not much time is spent there, so it was adequate.  All in all, this was a great place to stay with lots of charm.  I would definitely consider staying in this condo again if I ever get back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place to stay in Austin. Clean, cozy loft was super convenient to ACL and downtown. We will definitely stay again upon our return to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Very nice view.  Comfy bed!  Thanks for a nice stay 
,,,,,,,,"It was a very pleasant experience staying at the Loft. The location was within easy walking distance to all the attractions to 6th St and a doable walk to Rainey St. It was a bit tight and would have slept 4 comfortably, to sleep 5 adults is a stretch. I would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Sweet little place. Amazing location. Exceptional communication with hosts.
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location in Austin for work trip -- coworkers were down at the W and it was an easy and safe walk to meet them before/after work. 

Apartment is clean, straight-forward, and as described. I was the only one staying, so can't speak to the daybeds comfort. Mine was great.

Raquel and Jacob were very responsive to my questions and feedback (was looking for an alarm clock, for example). 

I did have some issues with very loud very late night neighbors on a random Thursday night which made it hard to sleep. Bad for a work-night. Sounded like they might be moving but Raquel mentioned there were earplugs I think. Worth asking about in advance if you're a light sleeper or there for a business function like I was."
,,,,,,,,"Jacob was a great host -- he was super prompt in responding to any questions that I had, and checked in to ensure we were enjoying our stay. 

The location of the space can't be beat -- we were attending SXSW and found the apartment very convenient for attending sessions and events. "
,,,,,,,,The space was beautiful and Jacob and Raquel were very helpful. I highly recommend the list of restaurants that they've provided. The view was absolutely beautiful! 
,,,,,,,,"Felt very welcome in the apartment! Pics very true, a very comfortable space. Jacob was very responsive to texts and even had great suggestions of things to do! It was a great experience."
,,,,,,,,"Cute, neat place in a great location. Thanks for a smooth experience!"
,,,,,,,,This place is great. Neat and tidy with prime location. The front door dumps you straight onto 10th and congress which makes it really convenient to all that downtown has to offer. The views of the capital at night are hypnotic. I would definitely recommend/stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob's place was super duper convenient for walking around. We walked way East on 6th Street to White Horse and way South to all of the shops on South Congress. It's just a block from the Capitol and we had good drinks at the Driskoll, watched the bats come out from the bridge at dusk, and caught a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse. Jacob was super responsive to a couple of small issues, even bringing by a new coffee maker over the weekend. 

A word of warning that the church bells are really loud at 8am so you might be served well by some earplugs, and when the heat is on (and I would imagine that this is normally not even an issue since it was unusually cold the weekend we were there) the windows in the bedroom really rattle and it sounds like a helicopter is hovering outside!

Thanks guys, we would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Check in was easy. The online manual was extremely helpful. Place was cute, clean and very well located. Would stay again the next time I am in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Lovely apartment! Exactly as described and pictured. Having a code for the door was great. Recommend if you have an event downtown or are active and want to rent bikes. No need for a car.
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were extremely easy to deal with.  They made the arrival easy and even arranged for an early bag drop.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and as described.  "
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob's loft was perfect for our stay in Austin. We were in and out all weekend--easy location to get to all neighborhoods. The place was kept clean with new linens and towels, and had nice views of the capital building. Their instructions made it really easy to check in and out, and Jacob was easily accessible by text message. He was also super flexible and accommodating with different check in/out times--much appreciated!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location (for easy walking access to the Capitol, UT, 6th Street bars, and the waterfront) and really well done for such a cozy space.  Was a little suspicious of the parking recommendation in the manual, but watched the youtube video (so helpful!), parked in the lot as recommended, and didn't get towed!  Also appreciated the very easy check-in procedure. Host knew we were looking for neighborhoods to move to and gave us some really good insight."
,,,,,,,,Everything was great and the spot was very quaint.  The apt is very clean and the all the linens were like new. Great view of the capitol and very little walking to distance to main attractions.  The area is also quiet at night.  I would stay here again and recommend friends to do so as well.
,,,,,,,,"Hosts were very well organized and very accommodating. The apartment is very cute and worked well for four people who were in and out throughout the weekend. The sound system is great and the location is very convenient to fun places in the city. Highly recommended, thanks Raquel & Jacob!"
,,,,,,,,"Jacob was excellent in communicating and had a great attitude about everything. The place was just as described, definitely had that musical Austin touch, and it was a few blocks away from all the fun things in Austin. Definitely the perfect replacement for an overpriced hotel. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was exactly as listed. The bedroom was big enough, the common area contained two comfortable beds, and the bathroom was nice. There were two of us in town for a wedding, and the dual bed setup in the common area actually worked out much better for lounging around than a single couch would have. There's no TV, but that's fine because we were out exploring the city the whole time. When we were home we would plug some music in to the speakers...nice touch there."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed for 5 weeks. Great place and great host. Small issues were resolved promptly.
The place does not have a washing machine which is necessary for an extended stay but my laundry was picked up washed and folded same day for a small $5-10 tip. No TV but I don't watch any!
The view and the location is unbeatable which are the important things. Felt safe. Greatest coffee in Austin in 1 min walk (lavazza). Highly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"This is a fabulous place to stay if you ned to be in downtown Austin for any reason.  It is clean and well appointed, with everything you need, yet still homey and relaxed.  The bed is very comfortable, and the view of the Capitol is really nice.  It is far enough away from any noisy street to be peaceful, but close enough to walk to most things!  Perf!!
Jacob was helpful in every way.  All our communication was by text, but he answered each question I had and was always gracious and attentive to my needs.  As a single traveler, this made a big difference!  He was also very collaborative and accommodating when I arrived a day early without realizing it!  In my opinion, this puts him in the highest category of host - thank you Jacob and Raquel!!!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was fantastic! Check in couldn't have been easier, and communication was always super prompt.  We were a bit concerned about the parking due to special events going on, but in the end we were able to find parking a block away, so it wasn't a big deal.  The loft was clean and really well located.  My two friends loved the place as well.  I'd definitely love to stay again should I find myself back in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was neat and clean. The manuel they provide online is detailed and informative. Nice view of the capital. Not too far of a walk to the convention center, and quiet at night."
,,,,,,,,Very convenient location. Easy check in and out. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Cute little apartment, perfect for one or two people, might be a squeeze with more than that. 
Nicely furnished and maintained in a wonderful location! 

No toilet paper on arrival, but this was quickly resolved by Raquel and Jacob. 
Very quick response times from hosts. "
,,,,,,,,"Great spot with a great view! Clean and architecturally beautiful loft in a quiet neighborhood. Raquel + Jacob responded quickly to all my messages so was never left in the dark. Biggest plus for me: everything is walkable from this place, including Zilker Park and the most adorable local grocery store I've ever encountered."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location for downtown visitors, very convenient. Definitely would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice walkable place. I liked that the loft had sleeping area for about 4 people. For the price, I think the experience could be a bit fluffier: ie - hand soap in both bath and kitchen, some basic cooking supplies like olive oil, the place could be fixed up a bit nicer. Kind of felt like an extra clean dorm room. Worked for our purposes but was no frills. "
,,,,,,,,My boyfriend Weston and I really enjoyed your adorable Austin apartment. Will keep your place in mind on our next visit to Austin. The place was very clean and inviting. Thanks for making our experience memorable :)
,,,,,,,,Great rental!  Outstanding location.  Incredible view of the capitol.  Very close to all things interesting in Austin.  Very clean and cute.  Nicely decorated and equipped with necessary items.
,,,,,,,,Great place. Right in downtown. Easy to get around from. Everything was super smooth
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed staying in close proximity to everything downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a last minute airbnb search and Raquel+Jacob were one of the few to respond quickly. We arrived 1.5 days after booking and the place was very well kept. As others have mentioned, the location and view were awesome. 
Also, the bed is very comfy. Haha."
,,,,,,,,This place is in an excellent location to experience Austin! The hosts are very helpful and made the trip very comfortable. The place is nice and comfy. Would definitely recommend to others.
,,,,,,,,"Although my and my boyfriend's stay in Raquel and Jacob's loft was a short night, everything was perfect. The rooms were tidy and very clean. The place was a great walking distance from everything and Raquel and Jacob make it easy to know where to start. The view of the Capitol was gorgeous! We would definitely stay again when visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,great host and area. host was super-responsive. i've stayed there before and is why i stayed again!
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is great. My girlfriend and I used the B-Cycle (which is one block away) to get everywhere we needed to go. We also walked around the city because the apartment is centrally located.

The speakers were awesome to play music after a long day of exploring. The apartment is a good size and definitely felt like our little home while we were in Austin.

Would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This is a great little place that we would come back to in a heartbeat. The capitol is quite literally across the street (only a parking lot separates) and restaurants and nightlife are steps away. Could not ask for a better location in Austin, especially for the price. Raquel and Jacob are great hosts, easy to communicate with, and they make check in and check out a breeze. Would definitely recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"The loft was absolutely perfect. We actually live just a few blocks away, but wanted somewhere special to stay for our wedding night. Everything was very clean and the view of the capitol was lovely! We are excited to have discovered a great place to stay near our home and will certainly recommend it to family and friends who visit in the future! The hosts were incredibly accommodating and worked with our busy weekend wedding schedule and our need to check in a little early. The roses on the counter were a special touch for our wedding weekend! Thank you again!"
,,,,,,,,This was a great place and very convenient to everything we wanted or needed.  
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacobs apartment is fantastic, situated in a great location with a lovely view of the State Capital building.

Our previous accommodation canceled on us only 24 hours prior to arriving in Austin. Thank fully Raquel and Jacob were great communicators making the booking process very quick and very smooth.

One comment, which is a personal preference,  the bed is very soft so if you have trouble sleeping on a soft mattress,  you may struggle here. Otherwise the apartment is very comfortable and clean.

Thanks Raquel and Jacob!"
,,,,,,,,Communicating with the host was fast and easy. Their instructions and recommendations were great and the keyless entry was so convenient when I got in after 10pm.
,,,,,,,,"I had such a wonderful stay here! It was really a seamless experience and we felt right at home. Great location, too! Thanks to Raquel and Jacob for having us!"
,,,,,,,,"Incredible location in Austin. Clean, functional and very pleasant place to stay, right the heart of the city. Raquel and Jacob made it simple to check in and out (keyless entry is great). They are friendly and they also provide a very professional experience. And don't forget the great Capitol View. If I get back to Austin, this is the only place where I want to stay. 


"
,,,,,,,,"This historical loft was perfect for my business trip.  Spacious, comfortable, clean and convenient.  Raquel and Jacob were great hosts and very accommodating."
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful weekend in Austin that was even better thanks to the beautiful apartment and assistance we received from Raquel and Jacob! Highly highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at this loft over the past weekend with my sister. I was in town for an Open House Day at UT for a graduate school program and the location for us (without a car) was perfect. Super easy getting to and from
The airport to the apartment - there is a ""100"" bus stop a couple blocks down on 3rd and Congress. We found this easier than the provided directions. The apartment itself is great - very cutely decorated and super comfy bed plus you can't beat the capital view from the window. The hosts were very communicative and easily reached. We had no problems but I'm sure they'd be very responsive if anything would have come up. They even let us leave our bags for an extra hour until we headed back to the airport, much better than lugging them around Greenbelt. The keyless entry also makes for a very smooth, no hassle check in. No regrets choosing this spot from air Bnb and I would definitely recommend it to friends, family, and fellow air Bnb-ers. Thanks for the enjoyable stay! 
"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, very clean apartment. Raquel and Jacob were responsive to our questions over text and email. This place is definitely a good value. The apartment is ideal for one person or a couple, as the living room windows face a main street and there is light and noise from the street. But, the daybeds were comfortable and we found a white noise machine in the closet, so it all worked out!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was exactly as described and the apartment lived up to the pictures. Raquel and Jacob were very hospitable and I had an excellent first Air BnB experience.
,,,,,,,,Great location and great hosts. They even left beers in the fridge! 
,,,,,,,,"This was my first attempt at using the AirBnB service.  I was quite pleased with my choice.  It's only about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport. The place was conveniently located to downtown, which made walking to restaurants quite easy.  Also, there is a bike rental station just up Congress towards the Capitol building...another convenient and fun way to get around.  The place was clean and well stocked.  Internet access and plug and play music was painless.  I would definitely consider staying here again the next time my plans take me to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a WONDERFUL place.  The loft was clean and comfortable, with a beautiful view of the Capitol.  Raquel and Jacob were very responsive and helpful, and even reached out throughout the stay to check and make sure I didn't need anything.  

The loft is a great location, as it's right by the capitol and easy walk wherever you want to go downtown.  I was attending a conference at the convention center, and thought the walk to 2nd and Trinity might be too far, but it was a quick and lovely stroll down Congress.  

Though I had the place to myself, it would comfortably sleep 4.  The small kitchen was perfectly stocked with cookware and utensils, and I very much enjoyed listening to old Queen cassettes and other gems that Raquel and Jacob have provided in the loft.

I've already recommended the loft to several conference-goers, and will continue to.  If you're staying in Austin, particularly for an extended stay, this is a great home-base.

"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect locale. Except for giving me the wrong code to get in. Small one bedroom with a walk thru to the bathroom is not what the host describes online.  The bathroom is dingy, but the main problem was lack of toilet paper and too few frayed towels for the number in our party.  Excuses not that helpful.  Be sure the place is stocked, and don't try to put more than a couple with kids they like here; layout doesn't work for three adults unless they are intimately acquainted."
,,,,,,,,Great place-- awesome location.
,,,,,,,,"Super fast and easy communication, great apartment, amazing location, would love to come again!"
,,,,,,,,"I messed up and reserved for the wrong week by accident but host was gracious and accommodated us anyways!

The apartment is exactly as described. *Amazing* location and view. Great walk ability to all the fun stuff on 6th but also to UT if that's more your scene. Hosts have a wonderfully helpful tumblr with things to do, worth checking out.

Electronic locks means there wasn't even key shuffling or exchange, so easy! Hosts are very responsive."
,,,,,,,,"The loft is beautiful! I love the street, very calm and nice view! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Amazing place! Amazing host! I recommend this place to anyone that wants to be close to everything.
,,,,,,,,"Raquel was so accommodating and very quick to respond to texts.  The location is great and the place is really clean and nicely decorated.  Just note that if you plan to use the beds in the living room, the windows are very loud.  You can hear every word and car from down the street.  Also, the parking can be a pain on weekdays.  If I didn't have a car and needed a good, clean location, I would absolutely rent from here again."
,,,,,,,,"This place exactly fit our needs! The location is very close to downtown Austin, Raquel and Jacob were very responsive as hosts, and the place was clean and well-maintained. Be prepared that it is quite cozy for four people. Two people will have to share a bed unless they request an air mattress."
,,,,,,,,Very helpful and communicative hosts and a great location just a few minutes walk from 6th street. Raquel and Jacob also provided an excellent and exhaustive list of recommendations which really made out stay!
,,,,,,,,Nice clean place. Very convenient. Comfy bed.  Great view. 
,,,,,,,,This loft was perfect for a weekend getaway to Austin. It's centrally located and very walkable to both east and west 6th street entertainment districts. It's located far enough from all the action so you won't be disturbed by the nightlife. Everything was neat and tidy. We really enjoyed the cassette player and stereo system. 
,,,,,,,,"The space is fantastic, perfect set up for a great stay for a couple or a group in Austin. They have a great speaker set up that's easy to use and ready to plug into any device. 
Raquel and Jacob are very gracious hosts and are very quick to respond to any needs that come up. They gave me great ideas for parking and where to go in town. 

I plan on staying with them again!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed here for 2 nights and it was perfect. The view of the capital is amazing, the location is great, and the place was very nice and well kept. We will stay here again when back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome, hip apartment. Three of us stayed comfortable here for four nights, and everything worked out well. Raquel and Jacob were very responsive and helpful in regards to things to do/see while we were in Austin. The apartment's location was also prime...right in the heart of the downtown area. Anything we wanted to do was walking distance or a short cab ride away. "
,,,,,,,,the place was great....clean and comfortable. the location is great as well. Raquel & Jacob made the whole experience pain free and they were very responsive with correspondence. the decor was pretty cool as well! 
,,,,,,,,"Super convenient location and cozy apartment made me feel like a native Austonite for a weekend. Very clean and comfortable space and bed. Will definitely book with them again, if they let me :-)"
,,,,,,,,"Their place was very nice, clean, accommodating, and perfect location. I left it very clean, with garbage in their trash cans just as expected. I do appreciate the discount they provided very much, but later found out they expected the place to be left IMMACULATE because of that (which they failed to communicate to me prior). In the end there was just a break in communication of what both sides expected. I'd stay there again but would just be clear in communicating whats expected during your stay."
,,,,,,,,"Raquel and Jacob were great hosts.  The apartment is clean, cute and conveniently located (we didn't have a car the weekend we were in Austin and were able to walk everywhere).  I would recommend this apartment to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Central location, walking distance to everything. Very clean and spacious."
,,,,,,,,"The location of this apartment alone is worth the price of admission. Upon entering it was clean, spacious and more than enough for my quick weekend trip. Jacob was very helpfull and reccomend some great spots. 7 minute walk to 6th street. Great host, will definitely rent through them again."
,,,,,,,,"3 friends and I just had the best weekend in Austin!  Jacob was helpful and accommodating and the apartment was clean and new.  It had everything we needed and was in a great location.  If I came back, I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Everything exactly as described...great value overall! Will definitely be staying here again next time I am in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Jacob's place was exactly as advertised. Easy to get into and great location with good views. Would stay there again!
10279260,4.5,10,10,10,10,9,10,"The space was great and Ari's profile for the unit was very accurate. Open parking was helpful, since we had a rental car. The three flights up were a little rough with luggage and all, but worth it for the views. The master bed was super comfy and the unit was clean. You can walk to South Congress easily, as well as to Lamar and downtown. Had a blast!"
,,,,,,,,It really is a great apartment. Excellent location - clean - well equipped. Nice to have two full bathrooms. Excellent TV and internet before you hit the town. Very up-to-date. It would be nice to have a regular bed in the second bedroom. I'd go back to it again.
,,,,,,,,Listing was accurate! Great communication with host! Would definitely go back!
,,,,,,,,"I stayed 3 nights with a girlfriend.  Thanks to the 2 separate bathrooms we were not in each others way.  The apartment was clean, very spacious and exactly as pictured.  Can't beat the location.  There is only a futon in the 2nd bedroom, but I followed the suggestion in someone's review and used the air mattress in the closet, and I slept like a baby.  Ari was extremely responsive and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Clean, great view, quick responder, and close to a lot of fun things to do. "
,,,,,,,,"Guter Platz nahe beim der City mit sehr guter Ausstattung.

"
,,,,,,,,"The location is great. We walked to downtown and restaurants every day. Check-in check-out was a breeze. The host, Ari, was very good responding to my questions. It's clean and well equipped inside. Very pleased with the stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Walking into the building I thought maybe I made a mistake, but as soon as you open the door - the listing is exactly as promised. Everything is spotless and brand new.  It's in a great location.  

My only recommendation - more towels and maybe an extra pillow. There were 4 of us, it would have been nice to have an extra towel because we weren't really there long enough to do laundry.  We made it work and overall it's a great spot and that didn't affect our experience at all."
,,,,,,,,"This condo is in a great location on South 1st, and the unit is remodeled with new appliances. The check-in process was simple with the key being in a lockbox upon arrival, and the third floor unit provided a decent view towards downtown from the small balcony. I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a quiet place that is still in the center of Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Only thing that could make this place better would be an actual bed in the 2nd bedroom and not a futon, but other than that, this was an excellent experience. Location was fantastic and everything was as promised."
,,,,,,,,"I experienced one issue with this stunning condo. The 2nd bed was a very uncomfortable futon, but I found an air mattress in the closet that did the trick. As far as cleanliness and location this place is top notch. $100 cleaning fee is hard to swallow but the place was spotless when we arrived. "
,,,,,,,,Great Place.  Centrally located to Best Austin has to offer 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was a great space in a calm, quiet neighborhood. Comfortable, very private, and spacious."
,,,,,,,,"We ended up here after our first air bnb booking had no power, and Ari was very responsive and answered all of my questions immediately via text. The place is beautiful and clean, and such a great location. Even better than our original plan!"
,,,,,,,,The host is great.  the area is so close to downtown.  It is a great location.  Just need a bed in a second bed room. 
,,,,,,,,The condo is as described.  It is within walking distance of the performing arts center.  A great place for those Austin concerts.  Lots of restaurants up the street.  A great alternative to the areas hotels!
,,,,,,,,"Ari's place was very close to all of the great things that I love about Austin, particularly SoCo and the trail around Town Lake. "
,,,,,,,,"Ari was an excellent host. He contacted me with all the necessary information I needed prior to check-in and made it very easy. His home is very well furnished and incredibly clean! Among other things, there were plenty of linens available for me and my family. The location is great as well, its a quiet little area but quick walk or drive to SoCo, Zilker Park, and other downtown attractions. Highly recommend staying here even if its just for a weekend. "
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay and the condo was very comfortable. I will definitely book again if I am in Austin in the future.  
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying at Ari's apartment! Wish we could have stayed for longer. A beautiful bright and spacious apartment that was plenty of room for my husband, son and I. Some real highlights for us: Two bathrooms, HUGE bed, filtered water in the fridge, Netflix, super clean and tidy.

Ideally located with just a short walk to South Congress so we got around on foot for the first couple of days and then hired a car for the last few days so we could get out of town. 
Ari was an exceptional host - very accommodating and hospitable. The best AirBnB place we've stayed in. Highly recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Super beautiful and clean apartment! Ari was a super responsive and thoughtful host! 

We would defiantly book the apartment again, the next time we are in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"A very special location for sure! There's so much to do within walking distance, and you're right on the skirt of downtown. The condo is in the treetops and the view of downtown from the balcony is a nice bonus. The condo is large, spacious and comfortable. It is nicely remodeled and adequately furnished and appointed. The condo is wrapped with windows. With that being said, it's on the third story, as Ari has mentioned, so just realize that fact. Ari is an excellent host. We definitely will be returning and staying here again and I highly recommend. Ari answers your correspondence very quickly which is very much appreciated."
,,,,,,,,"Great location we didn't need a car, we used Uber from the airport, bikes from b cycle (station 1 block away) and electric scooters from clover.  The apartment is great, spacious both bedrooms are roomy with their own bathrooms and the fridge has filtered water. Views of the city are amazing at night.  Terry Black's BBQ is a five minute walk and the brisket is outstanding. Ari was extremely accommodating, easy to work with and gave us terrific restaurant  suggestions.  Ari always responded to our texts immediately and was so pleasant to work with.  Austin is a great place to visit, I highly recommend you stay at Ari's house, eat at Terry Black's, rent electric scooters from Kevin at clover, get ice cream at Amy's and Lick, ride b cycle down the river and watch the bats fly out from under the Congress St bridge at sunset.  Can't wait to come back Thank You Ari!"
,,,,,,,,"Listing is accurate and the apartment is a newly renovated apartment. This was a very last minute rental on our part due to issues we had a a previous rental. Ari was quick to work with us and address some minor issues that came up when we were settling in. To be fair, he had just listed the place and wasn't expecting a guest who booked at 10 AM and showed up in the afternoon, so no faults from our side at all over this. 

Check-in is easy. Basics of what you need at in the apartment. Bed is large and comfortable. Realize that you are walking up to get to the stairs that get to the apartment. You are in the treetops. 

We were happy with the listing and the area of town. It's a short walk to downtown or Barton Springs and not far from the running/bike paths along the river. If in Austin, we'd stay there again."
14978448,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,This was one of my best AirBnB experiences. Sarah was great with communication and the apartment was beautiful with a fantastic view. The location couldn't be better for a traveler or couple looking to explore the city. Right on Rainey Street and literally steps from the water. Thanks for everything Sarah!
,,,,,,,,"Great location on Rainey St, super clean place, washer/dryer, and cable with 2 TVs! Really nice apartment, balcony, and great views.

Sarah was a great host, and her place was amazing, would definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,The location couldn't get any better.  Shipper clean apartment with a great view within walking distance from downtown. Plus a trail along the river is literally across the front of the building.
,,,,,,,,"Could not be better
Beautiful 1BR apt perfect for a single or couple
Great building with secure parking, nice fitness area, hiking trail just out the front door
Rainey St is quite a partystrip and very fun, but even so, the building is very quiet and with a beautiful view from this unit
Sarah took care of all the details right down to leaving new toiletries and providing her direct contact number in case of problems
This is a great stay in a great location, very easy to find and easy walk to convention center and downtown"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 175 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5365091,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"LeeAnn was very professional and organised.  It was more like staying in a  near new serviced apartment than what I have previously experienced with any other Airbnb, and that was exactly what I wanted for a business trip to Austin.  

I had a lovely walk across the bridge to downtown Austin each day to get to the office, and plenty of food options when I had time.  Definitely top of my list for future business trips to Austin, and I really hope there is availability for me to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Didn't actually get to stay because of a family emergency but everything before hand was very easy. Clear instructions and easy to book 
,,,,,,,,Great location. New condos with modern amenities.
,,,,,,,,Amazing! Excellent location. She left clear directions and was available when needed.  I would stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, walkable to everywhere downtown, and a very secure building. Great experience overall! "
,,,,,,,,"The place is new, modern, and very functional. LeeAnn was friendly and welcoming. "
4174180,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Sarah's place was perfect for visiting downtown/east Austin! It's walking distance to great bars, restaurants, and Rainey St. Sarah provides excellent tips for exploring the area and is a wonderful host. The apartment is equipped with everything you need, very clean and quiet. I would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,This was a wonderful place to stay. Everything was just like the pictures and arrival was completely effortless. Sarah also had great neighborhood restaurant recommendations!
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying here! It was very clean and we loved the privacy we had. It's a short walk to Rainey street, and Sarah gave us some great tips on restaurants that all turned out to be amazing!"
,,,,,,,,Sarah's apartment was great. It was exactly what I expected. The location was perfect and we were within walking distance to Rainey St. and a lot of other places. I highly recommend booking with Sarah
,,,,,,,,"Clean, tidy, safe and great location for the convention centre. Great town."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was so kind and helpful!  My friends and I loved the space.  We were so glad that we chose to go this route and not stay at a hotel.  The location is terrific.  No problems with parking at ALL which made things extra easy. 

We felt totally welcome and would definitely recommend staying in this adorable spot."
,,,,,,,,An amazing place for two to have adventures in Austin. Planned a trip for a family wedding but made a short vacation out of it. 5 nights in a very clean and conveniently located apartment. Sarah was available for any little concerns and extremely helpful with the going-ons in Austin. Would definitely return to explore more of Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"What a fantastic stay! Sarah was very communicative and friendly, even let us drop our bags off early so we could take off without them in tow for a few hours since the room wasn't ready yet and no one was still checking out. Wonderful unit a short 20 minute walk to downtown, comfortable and clean and has everything you need! Sarah was awesome, very friendly, and a great host. I would absolutely stay with her again!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's house was perfect for my needs - it was close to everywhere I needed to be during my stay in Austin. I was attending (and working) a trade show at the Austin Convention Center.

Sarah was incredible at communicating and her response time was nearly immediate. Her guidebook was incredibly helpful - especially on tips to get around the city.  While the house is definitely within walking distance to all the fun spots, I mostly used cabs to get around as I was on my feet all day and night working. Had I planned it better, I would have rented a bike to go back and forth to the convention center (there is a bike rental place right outside the venue).

The house was exactly as it looked in the pictures - simple and clean.  Even though we are ""smack dab"" in the middle of the city, it was so quiet. The neighborhood is wonderful - old, quaint, and in a few years time it will be back to its former glory.  

Thank you Sarah for a great stay!

Cheers,
Lori"
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay at Sarah's place.  We recommend renting a bike just around the corner (the one with the coffee shop).  Close to the bike trail around the lake.  We did walk to 6th street but be cautious at night.  Austin is a great city
,,,,,,,,"Everything went great. Clear, proactive communication, great place, quick walk to Raney (URL HIDDEN) of my best Abnb experiences."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place is in a perfect location! We were able to get transportation to ACL and it is a short walk to Rainey street. Sarah made sure everything was ready for us when we arrived and was a great communicator. I would recommend anyone to stay here, it was so clean! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location with easy walking access to food , drink and nightlife.  Tacos Tacos Tacos!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location. A pretty quiet street that's close to downtown, sixth street and 12th street. Perfect size for a couple!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin! We were able to get around easily & loved coming back to Sarah's cute (air conditioned!!) place. The neighborhood was quite & perfect. We didn't meet Sarah face to face, but the place we fully ready for us, & she communicated during our stay to make sure everything was going well. Would definitely recommend to anyone for both short or extended stays! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed in Sarah's home for an entire month and would highly recommend her home. She has been such a welcoming and great host; very quick to reply, always very accommodating, attentive to her guests and her family are so nice.  The guest house is also beautiful (tasteful interiors),  spotless and private.  It's well located - near to downtown, the park, Rainey street, 6th street, and all the hip East Austin restaurants and bars.  Have had such a good time, thank you Sarah!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah warned us Austin in July would be hot and she was not wrong. We're from London, England so the all-day dry Texan heat was quite a challenge at times. All the more reason why coming back to such a beautifully cool, tranquil hideaway was such a pleasure. I have never appreciated air conditioning so much! The flat was just like in the pictures: modern, comfortable, spacious and clean. Although we never actually met her, you can tell Sarah is a pro at hosting because everything is so well thought-out and organised. As for the neighbourhood, we did our research and it hit was perfect for us. We prefer what some people might call 'hipster' districts (think of the Mission in San Francisco or Peckham where we're from in London), but we wanted somewhere quiet to come back to, with nearby vegan food options as we're both vegans. We loved this largely residential part of Austin dotted with quirky cafes, beautiful modernist houses, cool bookshops, Mexican vibrancy and an edgy creative feel. Not to mention Austin's first vegan cat cafe, a few minutes' walk away (the cats aren't vegan, the food is. Just saying). The location is great, a quick drive into town. We prefer to walk whenever we can, so we walked into town and back when the heat wasn't too much or it wasn't too late (about 15-20 minutes' walk). If you like walking too, bear in mind that like most US cities Austin is designed around cars. So you'll have to negotiate some big roads and underpasses that might feel a bit intimidating, especially in the evening. We'd stay at Sarah's place again in a heartbeat. It was the ideal base to explore such a cool, creative and welcoming city(URL HIDDEN)"
,,,,,,,,"Loved having this place in E Austin. Great location and totally quiet space. It's clean and spacious, great for two people, plenty big for just me. Amenities were nice; Sarah even ran out to get an ironing board for me. Bed comfy and AC worked like a charm (necessary in summer). Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's house was perfect. We were in town for a documentary and her guesthouse had everything we needed in a prime location. It was very clean, bright and with all the basics one could need. We will be trying to book her place every time our crew comes back!"
,,,,,,,,"Adorable little apartment on the East side of Austin. My husband and I traveled down to Austin for the weekend, and enjoyed staying at Sarah's place. While it is an apartment to the side of the house, it feels completely separate from the house. The amenities provided were great as well, if you want to stay in it's easy to make a meal too. 

Sarah's recommendations for area restaurants were awesome as well! Bufalina is highly recommended for pizza! "
,,,,,,,,"I had a very lovely stay in Austin. The apartment was very comfortable and had more than enough space; it felt like a home away from home. It was easy to find good food nearby and, with Sarah's advice on the best route, it was a short and easy walk downtown. Sarah got in touch several times before my stay to coordinate my arrival and give me tips about the city. Overall a great experience."
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying in Sarah's apartment! This was my first Airbnb experience and definitely set my standards high. The apartment is private, clean, and comfortable. After long days wandering around Austin, it was the perfect place to relax and cool off.  The apartment is near Rainey street and walking distance to several delicious eateries as well.  Sarah and her husband also provided great suggestions and were very accommodating hosts. I would recommend this to someone visiting Austin who wants a residential experience with easy access to all Austin has to offer. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a wonderful host with an amazing apartment. The place was impeccably clean, well-stocked with all the necessities, and exactly as described with a great location in East Austin.  Sarah provided tons of helpful material including local guides, restaurant recommendations, transportation information, etc.  She was also very communicative even before our arrival, answering our travel questions and giving us a heads up concerning issues with Uber/Lyft in Austin.  We would highly recommend Sarah's place to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I had an absolutely wonderful time staying at Sarah's. Although the weather was far from perfect, we had a fantastic time visiting Austin, in large part thanks to our decision to stay with Sarah.

The home is beautiful and located in a very comfortable part of town. We were able to get to/from the airport for about $20 for a cab (unfortunately Uber/Lyft had just left before our trip). Rainey street is only about a 20 minute walk away, mostly through a residential area, which is very convenient.

The home is pretty much exactly as it is seen in the photos that Sarah has uploaded. It was very clean and well furnished, and definitely made us feel more comfortable than a hotel would have.

Sarah had a large book of recommendations, which we used to help plan some of our meals. All of her recommendations were top notch, and I wish we had used them more!

All in all, we had a great time visiting Austin, and would recommend staying here to anyone visiting the city."
,,,,,,,,"I loved this spot. Really convenient to most conference hotels and the conference center, plus fantastic restaurants and coffee shops and the like. Sarah was a great host; super helpful and communicative!"
,,,,,,,,"Just perfect! Incredible location, fantastic amenities, and awesome decor. After the first day we were there we already wanted to move in. Sarah was incredibly accommodating and very easy to reach when we needed her. Her guidebook she leaves for every guest was a great tool for us when we needed a quick recommendation to get out and start exploring. Our vacation to Austin was amazing and it wouldn't have been as great of an experience without Sarah's place. If you're looking for a place to stay in Austin, look no further."
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful place to stay.  Sarahâ€™s place is exactly as in the pictures. She gave us a lot of information up front and in the apartment thereâ€™s also a map containing some nice places to go. The apartment is very conveniently located in east Austin, and just a walk from down town and just around the corner of some great places to eat and drink (we really enjoyed Cenote and Launderette). The apartment was clean, comfortable and already supplied with some water, local beer and toiletries. Sarah was a lovely host. Thanks for having us."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's back house is great, and exactly as pictured. It's clean, simple, and private. It really is very centrally located. We walked to most places, as we generally wanted to hang out on the East Side anyway. The place was clean, quiet, and very well equipped with anything you could need. We ended up being in Austin during a flash flood and she even had an umbrella hanging in the closet. It's definitely a solid and comfortable spot if you're traveling to Austin. She also had a great book full of things to do in Austin if you're totally new to the city. I will say that if you're looking for something funky or with that signature ""Austin-y"" quirk, this might not be the place. It really is straightforward comfortable and simple, and very, very clean. If you stay here definitely go get migas tacos at Veracruz All Natural. Also, try La Barbecue. We had a great time here and Sarah is a pro-host."
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Sarah's. She thoughtfully provided us with plenty of essentials like toiletries, bottled water, and cold beer! Her place is within walking distance to many great places to eat like Laundrette, Bufalina, La Barbecue. And a short drive to 6th, but you're better off taking a cab. We loved Austin, are already planning our next trip, and hope we can stay at Sarah's again."
,,,,,,,,"We had such a great stay at Sarah's place. The location is fantastic -- in a cool, walkable neighborhood with great food, coffee and a beautiful riverfront trail all nearby. You're also a short walk to downtown, Rainey Street and 6th Street. The apartment itself is great -- spacious, comfortable and clean, with all the amenities you could ask for. And last but not least, Sarah and her family were lovely hosts who made us feel right at home, gave us spot-on tips about the neighborhood and were easy and flexible.

Highly recommended all around! We'd love to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"By far the best Airbnb bed I've had!! I'm even considering getting the same bed for myself. The apartment was awesome,  just like on the pics. Sarah was very helpful and sweet, and her kids are super sweet.  I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend this place for everyone.
And the location is awesome. So close to all my favorite taco places, and easy to get to downtown."
,,,,,,,,"Super cozy place to stay with a fantastic location. Quiet neighborhood with plenty to do within walking distance. The unit was very clean, and Sarah even left us some snacks and treats in the fridge! Just overall great experience.  Sarah was extremely responsive and helpful! I would definitely recommend this place.  We were so comfortable and happy staying here. Thanks Sarah!! "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place was an amazing place to hang our hats for SXSW. The location was within easy walking distance of down-town Austin with easy access to transportation.  Outside of the convenient location her place was clean, well kept and spacious - it truly felt like a home away from home. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's apartment is a great place to stay. It's in a great neighborhood for getting around Austin. Easy to walk everywhere or get the bus or Lift. The apartment is so adorable, just like the photos."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place was very comfortable, centrally located, and very well appointed. She was a very gracious and generous host, having water and refreshments waiting for us when we arrived. The carriage house was private from the main house, and quiet. The keypad lock entry was super convenient. Sarah was also flexible with our check-in and check-out times around our flight times. We would definitely stay there again, and I highly recommend staying in her place."
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I spent a long weekend at Sarah's Airbnb to explore Austin for the first time. Her place had a great location, just a few blocks from 6th street and Rainey. The place had all the essentials and was cozy to come home to every night. We put together a short list for future travelers of some of the things we enjoyed and recommend checking out.

Food:
Cenote - we liked the quick walk, they had a great cup of coffee and made a delicious breakfast burrito.

Wright Bros Brew and Brew - coffee was strong but equally as good. A nice quiet place to relax for a beer or cup of coffee.

Snack Bar - My wife has a gluten allergy and she was able to find the best gluten free Belgium waffles here. Great service, good food, and super friendly staff. Plus we loved the shops on S. Congress.

Nightlife:
We loved Rainey St! We spent most of our time there. Our personal favorite was Craft Pride for the great selection of local beer and the large deck out back with live music. Vie 313 also makes a great pizza, regular and gluten free.

We weren't fans of 6th because it was crowded and seemed unsafe after dark. We did catch a movie at the Alamo though and would highly recommend that.

Other activities:
I highly recommend anyone that is visiting, especially if they have the time to check out the great breweries down 290. We visited Jester King and Twisted X, both were fantastic. Jester King was a great place to just enjoy the nice weather. We also ventured up to Waco because my wife is a huge fan of Fixer Upper and we went to Magnolia Market. We would recommend this to any fan of HGTV or home decor."
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful basecamp for an incredible Austin experience! The house was very clean, very well maintained, and very cute! Not only did the space give us exactly what we needed (and more!) but Sarah was the perfect host. She provided the perfect amount of communication and her guidebook was full of recommendations that highlight the best of Austin. Great location, great house, great host! "
,,,,,,,,"Before, during and after our stay, Sarah communicated clearly and in a friendly, but not intrusive way. The perfect balance. The listing was accurate, we loved the unit, and we enjoyed the neighborhood--especially the convenience and the diversity. To me, the very best thing about this accomodation was that it was peaceful, private and quiet. The simple and calming decor was the perfect antidote to busy days filled with people, places, sights and sounds.    "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time in Austin, TX and Sarah's place was the perfect base for that. Sarah's respondence was very quick and clear and we felt welcomed at a nice place with a bottle of bubbles (which we didn't drink), a snack and lots of information about Austin and the neighbourhood. "
,,,,,,,,"We had the greatest time in Austin. Sarah was the perfect host- she left waters, beer and snacks out for us. The bed was super comfortable and everything was perfect and clean. Location was PERFECT!!! "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's guesthouse was lovely and in a great location. She provided easy and clear directions to get to the house and around the city, also with a great guidebook and recommendations of places in Austin. We were able to walk to many places! Great time in Austin! Thanks Sarah! Cheers!"
,,,,,,,,"Super comfortable, clean and restful, but homey at the same time. You can tell that Sarah's put considerable thought into crafting a beautiful space for her guests. Instructions were clear and convenient at every point along the way. Just the epitome of what you hope for in an Air BnB experience!  "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed for 4 nights in Sarah's guesthouse and it was everything we wanted -- quiet, clean, welcoming, safe, and close to good food and drink!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was unbelievably welcoming and helpful.  The house is in an excellent location and is extremely clean, cozy, and spacious. Sarah is extremely communicative and responsive. She does a great job recommending things to do in Austin in her guidebook and with some awesome and helpful magazines in the living room. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Her place was lovely. It was exactly what we expected and we had a wonderful time around Austin. 
,,,,,,,," Sarah was more than willing to help in every way possible. The place is cute and charming and close to everything in Austin.  It's in the best area possible if you're wanting to go for a weekend filled with different things to do.  She had great recommendations as well of places to try out! On top of the great experience, I left some things behind and she has mail them to me. You can't ask for anything more!  I will definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was great. It's a big space that's very clean, and I loved the location (walkable to E 6th St bars/restaurants and downtown). I'd definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"We had such an excellent time staying at Sarah's guesthouse!! Perfect location, perfect hosts, perfect city!! We would not hesitate in staying here again - already thinking about the next trip! The guesthouse provided everything we could think we'd need and much more. Sarah and her husband were both super helpful and provided some fabulous recommendations - top tips all round. "
,,,,,,,,"Welcoming, accurate, great location, clean, accommodating :) All of the above! Would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"The home was lovely, and everything was as described.  In fact the living room was a bit more spacious than we expected.  One small thing was we were woken up by a construction crew before 8:00 am one morning.  Because East Austin is undergoing a huge resurgence, a lot of the neighboring houses are being worked on.  Just something to consider if you are a light/late sleeper.  Otherwise, everything was great!  "
,,,,,,,,Great. Very welcome and helpful. 
,,,,,,,,"We had an incredible experience with Sarah and her perfect spot in Austin! Not only was she super helpful and provided AMAZING recommendations, the space was in the most convenient location to experience everything Austin has to offer! "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was singularly lovely, even though we only communicated by phone and text.  She was flexible when I panicked about a possible flight delay, and made us feel incredibly welcome.  The lovely little home was perfect - kept very cool by air conditioning, very quiet at night, cozy bed, plenty of storage space, nice big kitchen, and she even left us some sweets and a bottle of wine!  We had literally no complaints, and would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Great location, easy walking to some of the best food trucks in Austin as well as downtown, Rainey Street, and the East Side.  She is all a host should be!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place was clean, cute, comfortable, and in a great East Austin location. I pretty much couldn't have asked for anything more!"
,,,,,,,,"We truly had a great time at this apartment, which is close enough to downtown that we could walk back and forth.
Sarah's instructions were very clear. But in addition, she was always ready to solve any questions. I appreciated her kindness and professionalism."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's guest house was lovely! It was a quick safe walk to the Austin Convention Center with a great stop for coffee and breakfast on the way. Sarah was also a wonderful host. She quickly answered my questions, provided a lot of helpful info upfront and helped me coordinate my bags to leave at the house since I was getting in earlier than check-in but needed to head to a conference.  "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was extremely communicative throughout the entire booking process, and that continued throughout the lead up to our vacation! We were able to drop off our bags prior to checking in, and enjoyed all the snacks and beverages she left for us!

Accommodations were private, very clean, and comfortable. Definitely my best Airbnb experience yet. It was nice having a fridge, stove, and especially a washer/dryer! 

Location was great - definitely an area we may not have checked out if we had stayed right in the middle of downtown, so I'm glad we had the opportunity to see a trendy area with unique attractions and food. That being said, we had an easy walk downtown and also utilized Uber. (Costs of Uber rides were about $5-6 to/from downtown). 

Everything was great, and we'd definitely stay w/ Sarah and family again. 

"
,,,,,,,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sarah's home.  The pictures are accurate, the space is very clean, and the bed is really comfortable.  Just about 15 min from the airport and we loved the location in E Austin.    You're also only a 10 min walk to b-cycles and zip cars for exploring.  We will most certainly be back."
,,,,,,,,The listing and descriptions were accurate. Host was very accommodating. Everything was very nice and went well. The neighborhood is very quiet and charming. There are lots of nice restaurants and cafes around there. Great location! 
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a wonderful host and the apartment was comfortable and very clean! Great location, it was easy l walk to most of the places we wanted to go. Sarah made sure we had a nice stay. I'd definatly come back again!"
,,,,,,,,"It was absolutely fantastic place in a great location. Clean and well equipped, it even came with a wonderful neighborhood cat! Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place made our stay in Austin so much more enjoyable and memorable. The location was great and we really liked the neighborhood. Parking was not an issue and checking in was easy since there were no keys to be exchanged. The guest house has everything one needs and more. Sarah is very thoughtful towards her guests. Though we didn't spend too much time in the guest house, it was a nice and relaxing retreat after our outings. The location was also ideal as we were able to walk to Rainey Street and East Cesar Chavez for bars and eateries. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Austin-so much better than a hotel! Thank you Sarah!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a great host. I very much valued her detailed instructions regarding check-in, check-out, and navigating the east Austin area. The space was very clean and served as a quiet and relaxing apartment. The photos on the page were a good representation. I would definitely stay here again if came back to visit. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location & space! Very close to the cool spots in East Austin, and a short walk to downtown as well. Plenty of space for two people, flexible check-in time and a place to store our (EMAIL HIDDEN)fortable bed and plenty of space to stretch out or cook a meal in the kitchen if you wanted. Complimentary beer in the fridge and hotel-style new toiletries were also welcomed. We'd love to stay here again on our next Austin visit."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah is a an extremely thoughtful hostess with great taste. She filled her place with all the necessities: aromatic hair products, ear plugs, an iron, a hair dryer, pasta, olive oil, local publications, and Austin beer and mineral water. She made it so comfortable, and the location was great. From the house you can walk, drive, or bike to downtown and the surrounding neighborhood is a great walk. The White Horse with live music,  was a perfect bar for a Texas experience."
,,,,,,,,"It was lovely to stay at Sarah's, she was very friendly and helpful. There were yummy snacks and beer left for our arrival. The house was so conveniently located to everything we wanted to see that we walked everywhere."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place is great -  the place is lovely, the location is wonderful and walking distance from lots of amazing Austin sites. This is the second time we've been, and we'll likely be back again!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was beautiful! It was spacious , had a washer and dryer, bed was very comfortable, bathroom was nice and modern. It was pouring the first day while I waited for my friends plane to arrive, so the free Netflix account to watch was very helpful :) not a bad thing to say! Easy to get around town with an uber or walk. Around quarter mile away from La Barbeque. "
,,,,,,,,"The location is really nice - two of the best coffee places in Austin just four blocks away (Cenote and Flat Track), and one of the best pizzas of my life two blocks in the other direction (Bufalina). Walking into downtown or Rainey St is a bit annoying at the moment because of all the construction near Cesar Chavez and the freeway, but it's really easy and pleasant to walk down to the lake, and then walk along those paths to get anywhere, if you don't mind taking a longer stroll.

Checking in and out was incredibly easy, and the place itself was nice."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's space was great. The unit was spacious, comfortable, and - most importantly - a cool sanctuary from the summer heat. The place is walking distance to downtown Austin, Rainey Street, and some great eateries (including La Barbecue, home of the best brisket I've ever had). The neighborhood is really charming, safe, and walkable. I'd recommend Sarah's place to anyone looking for a place to kick up their heels in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying here was great!! I live in Austin and just needed somewhere to stay while waiting to move in to my new apartment. Sarah made the whole process very easy and made sure everything was perfect. The house was so cute and clean with plenty of space! Plus, the location was fantastic - plenty of unique and ""Austin-y"" coffee shops and restaurants near by and only a short drive from downtown and the UT campus. 
I'd definitely recommend staying here to anyone, whether you're a seasoned Austin resident or just visiting from out of town!"
,,,,,,,,"Arriving to the air conditioning being on was much appreciated as it was quite a hot day. The cold sodas left in the fridge were a nice touch as well. The property was as described and in a very accessible and central location, notwithstanding the neighborhood is still up and coming. Additionally, the washer and dryer were handy to have. For when we weren't out exploring Austin, it was great to be able to kick back on the couch with Netflix. The only negative would be that although it provides adequate cooling, the air conditioning unit isn't in the bedroom and the temperature in the bedroom relies on circulation of cool air from ceiling fans. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was very welcoming! She checked in with us via text throughout our stay. It was exactly the kind of thing we were looking for, for our busy trip. The house was clean and well maintained. We were concerned a bit about the single living room wall a/c unit, but it cooled the house efficiently in the heat of July."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Sarah's place. Awesome neighborhood that is walking distance to all of the great places you want to go in Austin (ie East Austin restaurants, Rainey Street, downtown, walking path along the river, etc). 

The actual unit was just as advertised. Nice, very clean, well air conditioned, and larger than other reviews made it sound. We met Sarah and she was very welcoming and friendly. I would highly recommend the apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place was just as advertised! Quite neighborhood, very centrally located and she had some great recommendations for local restaurants and hot spots."
,,,,,,,,"Great space, excellent condition, had everything we needed, Sarah was super helpful and responsive. Would definitely book again and recommend to others."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Sarah's place! The guesthouse is adorable and had everything we needed for a girls weekend in Austin. The place is located in a residential area, but is only a 10-15 minute walk or short Uber ride to downtown. Sarah was a wonderful host and answered all my emails and questions right away. I will certainly stay here again if I'm back in Austin and highly recommend Sarah's guesthouse."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's apt was just perfect for my short stay in Austin. It was clean, tidy, and very comfortable. Sarah was so easy to be in touch with and very accommodating (even allowing me to leave my bag after check-out to pick up later). The area is fantastic - close to great street art and funky neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops. I loved Cenote for both coffee and food - and it's just a five minute walk away. If you are a runner, the river trail is just a few minutes away and fantastic for long walks or runs. I'd highly recommend this apt and Sarah was a delightful host!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first time using Air BNB and it was an enjoyable experience. Leading up to the visit, Sara was very communicative and laid out all of the information we needed. When we arrived, we were so pleased with the accommodations. The house was  so cute and clean and was exactly as described in the listing. Sarah even left us a snack and some beer and drinks the in the fridge. The location is in walking distance to a few really great restaurants and within a 10 min block to Rainey street.  Everything else downtown was less than a 5 dollar cab ride. It was a really great! "
,,,,,,,,"If you are looking for the perfect crash pad in East Austin Sarah has you covered. Super communicative and friendly without ever compromising personal space, you can tell Sarah is a natural host. The space is immaculately clean and well appointed with washer/dryer (which is a plus for people like us who excercise every morning outside). The fridge had local beer and Topos in it when we arrived (nice touch and thank you).

 A couple of notes: 

This is a perfect spot for a couple of people or small family that is interested in being active around town and only using the space to clean up in between coming and going and sleeping at night, I wouldn't recommend this as a great spot to hang out or try and entertain even the smallest of groups. While the apartment is comfortable and accommodating, the bathroom is quite small (even for two), and the backyard, although off limits to guests (absolutely understandable and no problem), is utilized by Sarah's family/children and can mean drawn shades in the apt. for privacy. I would also recommend a car in this neighborhood. Although East Austin has grown up over the years with trendy nightlife now close by this apt., to take advantage of what the entire city has to offer, you need your own wheels (especially when it's hot; see spring/summer/fall). The best of this town is still spread all over. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for our family. Awesome location, clean and has a washer drier. Really couldn't believe how at home we felt. Sarah responded to our questions within minutes. Her and the guesthouse made our Austin trip a real pleasure. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place feels quite and tucked away but is in an excellent location for all of East Austin's many destinations. Downtown is also a short walk away. Wonderful, modern, clean space (with some Lone Stars and snacks to boot!). Sarah was very responsive and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here. "
,,,,,,,,"We LOVED our visit to Austin and Sarah's cute, cozy space. This little rental is located behind her house in East Austin and was very clean and decorated nicely (Ikea chic), 2 rooms (bedroom and living/kitchen area). There was a spare Aerobed in the closet but we didn't use it since there were two of us. Comfy bed and lots of extra linens available. Also really appreciated the Topo Chico and Shiner in the fridge!

Sarah was really easy to communicate with and we found the house without a problem - we arrived late in the evening but it was easy to get in with the coded keyless entry. I've lived in Austin before and East Austin is my favorite neighborhood - it was so fun to be within walking distance to our favorite spots (Yellow Jacket, Shangri-La, Eastside King, Eastside Showroom, etc.). We were visiting while on a cross-country road trip and really appreciated being able to wash clothes in the washer/dryer. Overall a great stay. We'll be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was an excellent host and the guest house was absolutely perfect for our needs! We arrived late in the evening, easily found street parking, and was welcomed into a large, very clean space with beer in the fridge! The bedroom was spacious, clean and very comfortable. We walked to La Barbecue down the street for some delicious brisket without the 5 hour wait for Franklins. Downtown was also within walking distance, so the location worked out really well for us. The unit has a laundry machine and dryer which was a huge help since we were driving across country and needed to freshen up our clothing. We would suggest doing laundry while you are awake because it can be a bit loud...but nothing worth complaining about. 

We would definitely return for a visit in the future and highly recommend Sarah's home! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Sarah's place in Austin. The apartment was adorable, clean and cozy. We especially appreciated the beer and pretzels!  Sarah answered all our questions and gave great recommendations for food in the neighborhood. I'd definitely recommend this place and host to travelers headed to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Smack (URL HIDDEN) a perfect name for this lovely simple, clean, very comfortably furnished-with-kitchen airbnb. Austin is within walking distance, the airport is a 15 minute car ride, and access to I35 is a couple of blocks away. The neighborhood is active during the day, quiet at night. Sarah provided everything I needed, including kitchenware, coffee tea and condiments. The bed is great!"
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location.  Easy to walk to so many things.  Best places were Craft Pride, Via 313, Bangers and anywhere downtown.  This home was described accurately and was a great place to stay.  Make sure to take great walking shoes and an umbrella just in case of rain.  Contacting Sarah was very easy.....we texted, when we arrived and a couple of times during our stay.  Very responsive and helpful.
Thank you so much for sharing this space with us."
,,,,,,,,Sarah was super helpful and attentive. She and her family were out of town during our stay - but the place looked good and was ready for our arrival. There were even outside lights on so we could easily make our way to the unit after the sun went down. The space is cute and clean and in a really great little neighborhood that we enjoyed walking around and looking at the diverse housing. We could actually walk to and from Rainey Street if we wanted - but if we didn't it was a short and cheap ($6) Uber to Rainey or E. 6th.  We could walk to grab breakfast and coffee in the morning - and could even walk to a park and the river if you wanted. We even discovered one of the infamous Austin Moontowers - just East of Sarah's place. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!
,,,,,,,,"Great place in a great location! Close to downtown, the river trail and great restaurants. Nice and clean with lots of space and a big kitchen. Sarah was a warm and welcoming host. She left beers in the fridge for us and gave us have a very late checkout as our flight was at 6. We will be back! "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's home in Austin is very inviting. My 2 friends and I stayed there for a 4 day spring break adventure. The guesthouse was clean and perfect for 3 people. Sarah provided great suggestions to make our trip awesome. 

Sarah's home is walking distance to several attractions; however, we did utilize Uber to get to the notorious 6th street and the shops on Congress. Since the weather was awesome while we were there, we spent several days at Zilker Park (paddle boarding, picnicking, etc...), but it's a bit of a hike from Sarah's house. Renting bikes is a great alternative to getting around, but careful if you rent B-Bikes--they need to be returned every 30 minutes (even with a 24 hour rental pass). 

Some of our favorite dining places within walking distance from Sarah's were Cenote/ JuJu Juices and Yellow Jacket Social Club. You will not be short of fun things to do and see while you stay here! 

Thanks so much, Sarah! "
,,,,,,,,The coach house was great and in a nice neighborhood. There were good places to eat and drink within a short walk. Also the bike sharing station was only about 3 blocks away.  We would definitely recommend this place to others.
,,,,,,,,"One of the best airbnb places i have stayed. Very well looked after house, great location. 
Sarah was an excellent host. Would stay there again anytime. "
,,,,,,,,"Although I was only there one night, I had a great time at Sarahâ€™s guesthouse in East Austin. The location was fabulous, within walking distance to cool Austin cafes, bars, and restaurants, as well as the Lake hiking trail. The apartment was clean and comfortable, fully equipped with kitchen utensils and a washer/dryer! Additionally, Sarah thoughtfully stocked the pantry with yogurt, peanut butter pretzels, sparkling water, and local beer. What else could anyone want? I highly recommend this place for a great stay in Austin.

Thank you!
"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place was just perfect for our four day trip in Austin.  Location could not be better, with many great places to eat and drink just a short walk away.  The guest cottage was clean, comfortable, generously stocked with some local beverages, and had a shower with great pressure!  We were fortunate to have the opportunity to meet Sarah and her husband one morning; lovely folks with a lot of good knowledge of where to eat, drink, or take a walk.  Don't forget to smell the beautiful ""grape soda"" tree and the end of the drive!"
,,,,,,,,"I visited Austin for a conference with my girlfriend. We had an amazing stay at Sarah's place. It was easy to find, ample parking and very close to downtown. The apartment was extremely clean, bright and comfortable. Sarah did an awesome job of getting us settled and making sure our departure was smooth. It was everything we wanted. Would absolutely stay again. Thanks Sarah!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a fantastically accommodating host, from the quick responses and easy communication down to the details (TopoChico in the fridge is always a nice touch). If you're into the East Side fun, it's also a quick walk to great cafes, bars, and restaurants. I'd definitely recommend her spot to Austin newbies and vers alike. "
,,,,,,,,"Coming from Portland, we had heard Austin was very similar. We couldn't believe how similar when driving up to Sarah's house. It was like being in our own neighborhood, but with cacti! She was there to to greet us and made us feel so welcome. 
My boyfriend and I were in town for the marathon, and Sarah's place was the perfect spot to be able to cook, veg out when we needed to, and feel rested for our race. The location made it even easier to enjoy Austin in the couple of days after the race. 
Thank you, Sarah!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a great host. I enjoyed my stay here. The location is great, the house is clean and comfortable and met all of my needs. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is fantastic!  I stayed there for nearly a month and couldn't have found a better place.  Sarah and her family were very welcoming.  The neighborhood is very convenient for getting downtown (walk or $4 uber ride) and there are a lot of things within walking distance.  Plus, the park by the lake is really close and nice to walk or jog in.  The space is great and equipped with everything you need to live there.  "
,,,,,,,,"In a fantastic location and with a terrific host, we thoroughly enjoyed our four day stay in this immaculate, neatly modern, and very thoughtfully appointed home. The neighborhood, an older one with smaller homes, is ideally situated just off 1st street a few blocks from I-35 and downtown Austin. It is also pleasant and surprisingly quiet, an altogether relaxing atmosphere mere minutes from the boisterous city. Sarah responded to any and all questions instantly, was consistently helpful, and prepared a lengthy, well-researched guidebook. The accommodations, which looked to have been recently remodeled, were comfortably spacious for two. A family of four would have little trouble, although two couples would have to negotiate one bathroom and one bedroom. Nevertheless, the living room is quite large and equipped with apple TV, netflix, and wifi for entertainment. The adjacent kitchen is fully equipped for nearly any cooking one might want to do with a gas stove, and Sarah had generously stocked the refrigerator with sparkling water, yogurt for breakfast, and an assortment of Shiner--a favorite Texas beer. There is also a full-sized washer and dryer for laundry needs. Furnishings seemed brand-new and well-chosen for comfort without clutter. Clearly, Sarah has put a great deal of thought and care into decor, functionality, and comfort. If her goal was to manage an extremely clean, brightly lit, and delightfully designed home with the highest degree of professionalism, then she has succeeded admirably. On our next visit to Austin we will look to stay at Sarah's place again: We recommend it highly and without any hesitation whatsoever."
,,,,,,,,"Although we didn't get to meet Sarah, the place was perfect - quiet, clean, and a great restful spot during our Austin trip. Couldn't have asked for anything more!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was very helpful and quick to reply. The accommodations were exactly as they were listed, and as cozy as could be. We had a great time!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome spot in a great part of Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a great host and super responsive! The place was quiet, clean, and spacious. I would definitely recommend to someone else making an Austin visit! "
,,,,,,,,"The greatest place to stay!
Warm, cozy, loaded with all the amenities you'd want, and so close to everything possible.

A great value for what's in the area, knowing as I also rented a place a block away."
,,,,,,,,"House was clean, very roomy for three of us, and looked just as nice as the photos. Bed, air mattress and couch were all comfy for sleeping. Very close to everything Austin has to offer...we walked some,  used Uber, and drove.

Sarah and her family were out of town but Sarah was always available. She was extremely flexible/accommodating when I had to make changes to the reservation. 

Was glad to meet Sarah and her family when our flight got canceled...She was as sweet in person as she had been through texts. So happy to get to spend a few extra hours in Austin at Sarah's!

We enjoyed our stay and all of us would recommend staying at Sarah's.
"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah and Erwin were amazing hosts. Sarah even offered and supplied us baby equipment before we arrived when we told her we would be bringing our little four month old. Communication with Sarah pre-stay and during our stay, was excellent.

The location of this apartment was exactly where we were looking at properties to hopefully move to in East Austin. It's in a great neighborhood within walking to the station, bus lines, farmers market, and restaurants. 

Their neighbors are also very friendly and willing to give you advice on the area. If you wanted to you can easily walk into downtown from this location as I did on a couple occasions. 

The apartment itself is newly remodeled, very clean, well decorated, and private. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend staying with these gracious hosts. "
,,,,,,,,"I had the best time at Sarah's private apartment in East Austin. The place was super clean, fresh, and tastefully decorated. The bed was super comfy. The little patio was set up with chairs and a bench and great for hanging out in with a glass of wine. Loved the extra touch of snacks, coffee, and Texas beer! Sarah was communicative, texting to see if all was well but not to intrude. The area she lives in is awesome, lots of restaurants, bars, and cafes in walking distance. I would highly recommend and plan on staying here as often as I can. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah (and husband) were very welcoming. They sent useful reminders and precise instructions on how to get to their place from airport. They also checked-in intermittently by text to make sure everything was going well.

The place was great - exactly as depicted in the photos. Newly renovated, clean, nice decor. The location was perfect for my needs - easy access to the conference center, but more importantly, easier access to great food, drink and culture in East Austin.

Would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I had an awesome time in Austin! Sarah's private apartment was exactly how she described. I really appreciated her quick responses and availability if we ever needed anything during our stay. When arriving we found delicious Texas beer in the refrigerator which was a perfect touch after traveling most of the day.  Sarah's unit is located in a great location- 10 minute walk to Rainey Street (which turned into my husband and I's favorite spot), easily walkable to 6th street and downtown, but luckily we used the B-cycles which are conveniently located in almost every section of the city you would want to go! Our highlighted perks of our Austin trip included: Barton Springs, browsing the shops located in South Congress, eating unique food at Qui, stumbling upon The Liberty (where every Saturday a University of Texas game is playing they have local restaurants cater for a ticketed price of one beer and shot). We happen to arrive on the night of Franklin's BBQ (which is typically a three hour wait in line), we spoke with Franklin himself and asked for other food recommendations and wrote a list for us that we followed the rest of the weekend! Anybody looking for a quiet neighborhood close to Austin's hot spots, I would definitely contact Sarah ASAP! "

,,,,,,,,"David is super friendly, helpful and professional.  You can tell right away he is a real pro at this.  He gave a lot of details of things to do in the area which was cool.  Also, everything about the rental is explained ie. wifi, tv, how to get in etc.  The place also has everything you need, coffee maker, towels, shampoo, microwave, hair dryer.  Just like a hotel!!"
,,,,,,,,"Loved David's place, would love to stay there again soon! Thanks David!"
,,,,,,,,"Good location. House was clean and cozy, kitchen is a little small but is okay for a quick getaway. We had great street food on Ceaser Chavez. We were visiting UT and place was ideal."
,,,,,,,,We had a great trip to Austin and loved the house. It was exactly as pictured and David and Christina made arrangements for us to come early and leave later to accommodate us and our flight times. The backyard was great to relax with friends and the beds were very comfortable. The house was within walking distance to Rainey Street which we took advantage of most of our trip. Thanks again for a great trip! 
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at David's place was perfect. Everything was clean and reflects what is shown in the pictures. David was a great communicator, and provided us with recommendations to make our stay even more enjoyable. Would definitely rent this place again."
,,,,,,,,David is a great host! He responds quickly to any and all questions/requests. He even offered a $50 refund off our stay because he found out the neighbors would be doing construction while we were there. He gave us a welcome basket filled with some goodies and provided a few toiletries. He also provided us with multiple restaurant recommendations and gave us an extensive list of suggested activities. Get location - short walk to Rainey Street. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,David's place is just gorgeous. Well located and equipped. Very clean. Would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"David's cottage is a great spot to stay in Austin!  Really walkable to a lot of great bars, restaurants and food trucks on Rainey and Cesar Chavez!  It isn't even that bad of a walk to 6th Street.

David was also very helpful with restaurant recommendations and tips for getting around town since Austin is an Uber-less city.  Ride Austin was a great resource, especially because my friends and I were in town for the USGP at the race track out past the airport.

Would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"This home was even cuter than pictures portray! 
Communication with David and his wife was prompt and extremely helpful.

The only ""negative""  is that the house is already booked for the dates in May for graduation when we are coming back for graduation! 

We will definitely check availability whenever we come back to town."
,,,,,,,,"Myself and 3 buddies stayed here for ACL. Everything was perfect. House, location, logistics. Had a great time. Thank you. "
,,,,,,,,"My colleagues and I came to Austin on a work conference training and decided to give this cottage a shot as our first company Airbnb. The walk to the hotel where the conference was only 10 minutes away, by taxi around 2 minutes. Christina and David were in contact with us from the very beginning of the booking; provided explicit details as to what the cottage provided, great restaurants and things to do list (thank you!), even gave us a heads up of possible noise from construction down the street. Prior to arrival we gave them a heads up that we would want to check in earlier than expected and they responded very quickly and were as accommodating as possible. The listing was accurate and the cottage was lovely. East Austin does have a reputation for being a bit rough in the past, but that is quickly changing. The cottage is next to a school and the neighborhood itself is calm. The neighborhood is up and coming as evidenced by the renovation done to this cute home and to the neighbors along the street. It's a short walk to the nightlife scene of Rainey Street and just a few blocks south of Cesar Chavez Street. Grabbing a taxi, or driving yourself, to the center of the city is a short 10 minute trip. I would have loved to bring along a few more friends to the cottage as it had a huge backyard, perfect for a picnic. Will definitely book again the next time we come back to Austin. Thank you guys!"
,,,,,,,,Loved your house! Great location - totally walkable and only a 7-10 min drive to downtown. Perfect for 5 of us visiting for a wedding in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"This is a professional super clean and safe Airbnb place, nothing negative to say here. A-mazing house, lovely hosts and a walk away from Rainy street perfect location! Will stay here again in a Next year.
You get allot more than what the post describes kind of a five star hotel, I could mention all the good things about this place but it will be too much to write :)

Thank you David and family.
"
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely perfect stay! This quaint home, less than 5 minutes from rainy street, with vintage appliances, wood enclosed backyard gave you a good home feel. Neighborhood was quiet. Interior was neat,clean...super soft beds!"
,,,,,,,,"Christina & David communicated with us perfectly prior to our trip and we enjoyed the cottage which was more spacious than we anticipated!  We did not want for anything during our stay and appreciated the consideration they had for what we might need during our stay. (Q-tips are always forgotten by me it seems!  Ha ha)

When we travel back to Austin, we will definitely try to stay at their cottage. "
,,,,,,,,"We loved this property. It is charming and has an excellent location. We really enjoyed walking to the local library, up to Cenote for yummy food and their gorgeous garden and over to Rainey Street. The property had every thing we needed for a comfortable stay. Lots of attention to detail.  Super comfortable beds with luxurious bedding. Impeccably clean. David was very welcoming and accessible. Thank you David! We had a rental car and this location was just a few minutes drive to Lady Lake where we paddle boarded, rode bikes and walked. Ideally located. "
,,,,,,,,Seemed like a relatively safe neighborhood. We could walk to Rainey St. and 6th St. which was a huge plus. Clean place with great amenities. We had a fantastic weekend here.
,,,,,,,,"Everything ok, well prepared, no problems. Thanks a lot."
,,,,,,,,"David and Christina's home was perfect ! We arrived to an immaculate house and chilly AC on a hot Austin Morning. David accommodated our early flight with an early check in which made things that much easier. The beds were very comfortable and the backyard was an excellent area for breakfast. The big driveway was perfect for our rental car. It is on a very quiet street which was nice to come back to after a day or night out on the town. It is a quick 5 minute walk to Rainey Street which was amazing. It is so perfectly located to get to Congress ave, 6th Street, and Rainey either by foot, cab, or rental car. We didn't have to travel more than two miles for an amazing meal. The food alone will have me coming back to Austin soon. 

Thank you David and Christina for making my Airbnb and Austin experience a great one ! "
,,,,,,,,Lovely place to stay. Would definitely recommend for anyone traveling into Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"David was an incredible host. He had excellent communication since we booked about 2 months out. We did have construction of a new house next door that was rather rowdy but that was out of David's control, but when we mentioned to him they were working out of Austin city ordinance hours he went over and spoke to the workers, which of course he did not have to do. We loved this house and the area we were in. Great location. It was perfect for our girls trip! Oh and the backyard is GORGEOUS! I would highly recommend this property and David for being such a great host! "
,,,,,,,,"David's family's house was really ideally located - about a ten minute walk each way - between the bar/restaurant scene on 6th street and the bar/restaurant scene on Rainey street. Actually, we managed to walk all over Austin from the house without too much trouble. The beds were extremely comfortable, the kitchen was all we needed, and basically all our needs were met. The only issue we had was that an apparently halted construction project was re-started right next door to us while we happened to be there. The good news is the workers didn't show up most mornings until about 8. Also, it looks like most of the heavy construction activity is now about done, so it shouldn't be as much of an issue in the coming weeks. Otherwise, Dave and his family were great about getting back to us and just generally being really helpful about the whole situation. Anyway, I recommend this cottage and will definitely consider it again the next time we visit Austin."
,,,,,,,,"David was a great host and their house was perfect for our needs.  He left us a little gift basket with snacks, coffee and wine.  The photos were accurate to the house and the location was fantastic for us.  David was easy to contact and was prompt with responses.  He let us check-in early since our flight arrived early.  Would highly recommend for any family or large group visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,Recently had a awesome time a this house! Walking distance to everything A+++++ great host 
,,,,,,,,"it was a lovely house - much warmer and beautify simply decorated inside than this photo would lead you to believer.  
Amazingly clean and organized - every wish anticipated.  
The place was so turn key that i had very little interaction with david.  it worked so well.  the bedding was immaculate and high end."
,,,,,,,,"Our group of 6 had a wonderful long weekend here. The house was clean and very nicely set up, the beds were very comfortable. E 6th St (15 mins) and downtown (20 mins), were an easy walk away, everything else was an easy Uber/cab, and we had a great time hanging out in the lovely backyard in between. David was a thoughtful and communicative host, and extremely accommodating, letting some of our group who arrived early in Austin into the house before the usual check in time. Would definitely recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"David was highly responsive both in our initial inquiry about the space and availability and after booking.  He was very helpful and informative leading up to the arrival date and once we got there, he was incredibly helpful even providing suggestions and recommendations. The house matched the listing so there was no surprises and even had a great backyard to relax in.  The location is really ideal if you want to check out Rainey Street and other neighborhoods nearby. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place!! My husband and I rent our place out often so we like to have a stay-cation in other houses, this one is by far the favorite! Comfortable and clean with everything you need. We had dinner on the backyard patio almost every night. Only a short walk to Rainey st for bars and restaurants. Even our dogs were totally relaxed. They suntanned in the big back yard then went for trail walks just down the street. Both guest rooms have comfy beds and are nicely decorated all while located on a quiet street and still close to the action! Can't wait to come back as David was a breeze to work with. Five stars!! Thanks David!!"
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a great stay at David's place. The location was great, with Rainey St and other local attractions a short walk away. David was easy to communicate with, and the house was clean with complimentary toiletries and snacks."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, close to the action on Rainey St. but still quiet and comfortable. David was a great host, accommodating before and during our stay. "

,,,,,,,,"This was perfect for what we were looking for in our weekend stay.  It had everything the 4 of us that stayed there would need and is in an amazing location.  The instructions had the perfect amount of detail, and the host was very responsive if we had any questions about our stay.  I would definitely recommend this place for 4 or less people looking to stay a few days in Austin.  Very pleased with my experience."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, simple checkin, and absolutely would stay again"
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay in this little studio. The studio is cleverly decorated to maximize space. The blue couch was already converted into a bed upon arrival so reality is, little lounge space. This unit is best rented if you expect to spend most of your time out and about. Trade off for fabulous location and total walk ability is noise. This unit is inherently noisy as it is first floor, located right next to one of the complex entrance gates, and there is a public sidewalk and parking outside. Owners made all accommodations to combat, including great sound machine! However, if you are a light sleeper or aren't in town to party, you may do better elsewhere."
,,,,,,,,"The location of this Condo is truly amazing. It's RIGHT next to the convention center and a very, very brief walk away from 6th St, Frank, and just about any other downtown location you might like to visit. In addition, there was a gated parking spot for my car, which means I didn't have to find parking downtown, and could come and go easily whenever I wanted.

Two worthwhile notes. First, the internet cut out on the last two days I was there. No clue why. It could be overworked, as it was being split between 3 different condos. I could have called to have it fixed, I guess, but since I was primarily using my phone, it didn't matter enough to me to worry about.

Second, the floor is some kind of white something. I didn't realize the implications of this until it was too late and left dusty shoe tracks through much of the flat in roughly the first 3 minutes I was there. If you stay here, I'd advise taking off your shoes IMMEDIATELY upon entering. 

One other note that's fairly specific to me. I like to plug my own entertainment hubs into AirBnb TVs. The TV in this loft is basically bolted to the wall and the HDMI cables entirely inaccessible. Not a huge problem, but worth keeping in mind."
,,,,,,,,THE perfect location!! Right in the middle of everything. We will stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"The good: Location is close to anything you'd want to do in downtown Austin and the unit provides a parking space with easy gated access to get to anything you'd like to do outside the city. The AC was incredible, which is crucial when it's 90-100* daily. We were able to easily get early check in and late check out. 

The not so good: This is not an apartment run by a single person but multiple units run by a 3rd party, which is fine until something goes wrong. Then it's a pain to get someone on the phone who can actually do anything to help in the physical location. 
- We had challenges with the code getting into the unit and it took close to an hour and multiple calls to get into the apartment, which is a pain after a long journey and standing outside in the heat while attempting multiple codes to get into your room. We also needed a brand new code once we were granted late check out. Just annoying to have to remember the code to get into the complex, another to get into the pool, and over the course of four days, four different codes to get into the unit itself. 
- The room's internet stopped working after about 12 hours. We called and after being on hold for another 20 minutes, we were told the router wasn't in our unit but another down the hall, and they would have to track down the guests in that room to see if they could get in and reboot it. In the meantime they gave us the password to a much much slower (read: not worth it) network saying they would call back when the real network was back up. They never called. The next day, we called again asking for the status. They said they would ""reopen"" the case (not sure why it was closed) and have someone call to tell us when it was back up. They never called. 

Things to emphasize (in the host's post, but worth repeating): 
- Be sure you know that this apartment is a studio, not a one-bedroom. There are two murphy beds (pretty comfy), but means moving furniture to get into either bed. 
- The unit is LOUD. It's right on a busy street, so be prepared for loads of motorcycle revving and ambulances. There were a few bachelor and bachelorette parties in the complex, so the small pool was packed and rowdy, which could easily be heard within the unit (though the noise canceling machine was helpful!)."
,,,,,,,,"I was very happy with this apartment.  I attended a week-long technical conference at the Austin Convention Center, and this studio apartment was less than 2 blocks away.  I was able to run back to the room during breaks or if I forgot something.  Its also just a few blocks away from some of my favorite music bars, like Friends Bar, on 6th street.  Kitchen had full sized fridge, Microwave, washer, dryer, and a stove.  I used the kitchen for Breakfast, but you could cook full meals if you wanted.  The bathroom was nice, with a large tiled shower.  The Shower temperature was a little finicky at first, but the unit has one of those tank-less hot water heaters, so once you get the shower the temp the way you like it, you won't run out of hot water, which is common with smaller apartments.  Both beds are the ""convertible"" type, so they fold away during the day if you want extra room.  The unit was spotless when I arrived, and one of the beds was made and ready to sleep in.  There were plenty of extra sheets, towels, and blankets to make you comfortable.  There was soap, shampoo, and conditioner which I thought was a nice touch, and the Wifi worked well.   

Some of the other reviewers have noted the ""noise"".  The apartment is on the ground floor at the corner of the building, so there is foot traffic walking by that might disturb you, but it was quiet by 10 at night, at least on the days I was there.  The owners were thoughtful enough to put one of those white-noise sound machines in the room, and I used it.  I was awake in the morning before I heard anyone outside.  I guess if you are planning to go to bed early, or sleep in late in the morning, and you are a light sleeper, you might wish it had thicker walls.  The unit had light blocking shades on all the windows, but small amounts of light spills in on the sides of any shade.  With street lights on both side of the apartment, this means the room is not totally dark when you turn of all the inside lights.  For me this meant I would not trip over anything when I woke up in the middle of the night, but if you like to sleep in absolute darkness, you might be annoyed.

Communication from the host, and access to the apartment were both fantastic.  They sent an email the day before with the code to get into the complex, and a separate code for the apartment door.  It was wonderful not to worry about loosing my key, or leaving it in the apartment.  

If I have reason to go back to Austin, I would be happy to stay here again.

"
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful little condo! Felt right at home. At first we thought there was only one bed, only to discover there was one behind the television! Neighborhood was lively and everything was within convenient walking distance. Thanks so much for letting us stay!"
,,,,,,,,Great modern place. Best location we could have imagined. It is first floor and has all exterior facing windows and you can hear people walking past. Wasn't a big deal for us at all. Just kept window shades shut. 
,,,,,,,,TurnKey Vacation Rentals were easy to work with and always on top of providing the information needed for the reservation. This stay was booked through Airbnb Business and our traveler from Europe had everything he needed at the Modern Downtown Condo!
,,,,,,,,Place was great.  The area was super fun.  Would for sure stat there again.
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,This was a great little modern studio in a fantastic location of Austin. It is well centered right next to 6th st and also walking distance to south congress. No complaints. A plus. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo itself was very modern and have the latest technology in home appliances (Nest AC, Samsung refrigerator, Samsung TV etc.) Also it was in a very good location downtown. It was walking distance to all nightlife (6th street or Rainey St) and restaurants. The only downside was since it was near to the nightlife, some nights it was loud. I would recommend this place if you want a fully loaded condo close to all the action. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was in a convenient location for enjoying downtown nightlife and eateries.  Everything was clean and very nice.  The unit is on the first floor so it is not very quiet but was expected due to the location.  I would definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,The apartment is right in the middle of town. Very convenient to all things downtown. It is so much downtown that it is not good for light sleepers. The city is active the and apartment is in the center of the action. Clean and bright apartment. Street level unit.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was really nice and clean, everything was excellent!!! Erica was very helpful with all of my concerns!! Excellent experience!! "
,,,,,,,,"The unit was really easy to access and was very clean. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom was great. The location is also pretty good, if you want to be close to downtown. We didn't spend any time in the neighborhood so next time I would likely stay in a different area.

The unit is on the first floor and since it's close to 6th Street, it was very loud between 10 PM and 2 AM. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, felt safe and really close to the action. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, easy access, clean and met expectations!"
,,,,,,,,"The property that I stayed at was in a great location and within walking distance of most anything we needed.  

The rental unit was extremely clean, modern and, as advertised.  It also had all of the in room amenities we had expected such as a W&D, dishwasher, etc...

My only issues, with the unit I stayed in, were the fact that it was at street level and there was a lot of road noise and traffic at night and the sidewalk traffic prevented us from opening the blinds to see outside.  Also, we stayed there 8 days and not having a broom or mop to perform minor clean-up during our stay was disappointing.  

I recommend the property but not the unit that I stayed in.  "
,,,,,,,,"Made a last minute rental on this place and it worked out very well for us. Our agent, Erica, was out of the office the day we arrived so we got in touch with TurnKey rentals and they provided us with the necessary information to enter the apartment. Keypad locks and a secure parking space made it so that we just had to show up to the condo and we were set! No going to another location to get keys, etc. Seamless and stress free experience. The condo also was what we needed and was only two blocks from 6th street, which was the most important quality. Would use Erica and TurnKey again!"

,,,,,,,,"This place is a true gem!  Geoff has a wonderful place that is central to everything you need and is accessible to everything!!  Will definitely book again when we are back in town!

"
,,,,,,,,Great Location
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location and a great space - as others have noted, the photos don't do it justice. 

Very handy having the Whole Foods caddy corner to the property if you're not wanting to go out every night. We've stayed a lot of places in Austin, but this is the first AirBnB that I'd stay at again in the future.

Give it a go if you're wanting to explore ATX. "
,,,,,,,,"The place is fantastic, Well located, nice decoration, has all the essentials, very comfortable and so felt at home there. Geoff is a great host, he was available and help me settle. I hope to stay there my next visit to Austin"
,,,,,,,,"Great location
Very accommodating host
Nice place
Very happy with the experience"
,,,,,,,,"Geoff was a fantastic host, made it very easy upon arrival. He place is in a great location It's easy to get to a lot of things It is secure, safe and very well decorated. Can't wait to go back to austin and stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed in Geoff's apartment during ACL. He was a great host- responsive and easy going. The apartment was an ideal location for ACL, within walking distance to the festival, bars and restaurants, and the running trails along the river, it was perfect for our weekend trip. Overpriced, but everywhere is overpriced during ACL.

Apartment comes complete with mason jars so you can drink like an authentic Austin hipster. "
,,,,,,,,"Geoff's place was perfect for our weekend in Austin. The apartment is beautiful, clean and has plenty of space. The gym and pool were added bonuses. There is free quest parking on the roof, which was great. Geoff was very easy to contact and he was quick to respond to questions. He leaves a list of restaurants, bars, and other sites to see in Austin which helped us plan our stay. I would definitely recommend Geoff's place! "
,,,,,,,,"Geoff was the best Host I've had on Airbnb so far! He was extremely communicative and accommodating. We had some odd hours when coming and going, because we had three of us flying in and out, and he worked very easily with our schedules. The apartment was located in a fantastic spot. You can easily walk to and from most destinations and bars/food. We personally used a app called ""RideAustin"" that worked wonderful for the places across town (Austin doesn't have lyft of uber, but RideAustin works just like them.) The apartment was extremely clean, and roomy for two people on the bed and one on the couch. It looks just like the pictures if not better (it's pretty hip and modern.) It would be a great place if you are taking your significant other out or just out with friends like we did. Again we couldn't ask for a better host or location. I would stay there again. He left a lot of good notes on what to do and see as well on the counter, and it was all extremely accurate and helpful. 5 stars!"
,,,,,,,,"We had an absolutely amazing time! Great location for stumbling home after too many drinks out in atx. Geoff was so friendly and accommodating, and the apartment was so great, we are even considering looking at getting one! Highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"The location was great! Went to the pool during the day, played records, and went out at night. Austin does not have Uber you have to get an app called Fastened (same concept).  The place was well decorated and clean! Geoff had recommendations and tips left out on the table for reference which was nice. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was as described.  This was a very convenient location and we had a terrific time.
"
,,,,,,,,Geoff had a wonderful apartment. Very clean and decorated well. Tv worked good for the rainy mornings before we went out to explore. Most things were walkable and we rented a car for the sights further out. Convenience of getting and dropping off the keys was fantastic. Very happy with our stay!
,,,,,,,,Everything about Geoff's apt was great! I had a wonderful stay and wouldn't hesitate to rent it again anytime I found myself in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Geoff's place was in pristine condition and everything that was needed for our stay was left in convenient locations as needed. He provided amazing recommendations for places to eat and things to see while in Austin.
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Geoff's apartment was as described. The location was central to downtown, nightlife, and restaurants. The apartment was comfortable for 2-3 people (1 person on couch). It was confusing to find the apartment when we first arrived because it is a large complex and we had to haul our luggage up 3 floors. However nothing we didn't expect with an apartment complex. "
,,,,,,,,geff was a great host. Communication was excellent and I really appreciated the flexible check out time since my flight back was late in the afternoon.  The place was super clean and felt like home and the locations was excellent. I recommend you check out Lamberts and La barbeque in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood; very convenient. Apt was modern and clean. Master bedroom was perfect with ridiculously soft sheets. Listed as a place for 3 people, but it's really not. There's a super comfy couch to sleep on, but there weren't any sheets for it.... Had there been, it would have been a decent spot for a third wheel!  Geoff was pretty responsive to our questions at all hours. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time! The apartment was clean, well decorated and very comfortable. The key pickup and drop off process was very easy, and the location was perfect. We would absolutely come back if and when we make it back to sunny Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Geoff made pick-up of apartment keys very easy.  We were off the plane and through the door in downtown in less than an hour.  The apartment was clean, tidy, and had everything we needed for the weekend.

The neighborhood is a great hub with Whole Foods across the street, and within a 5 minute walk of fun West 6th bars and restaurants.  10 min bike ride or Lyft/Uber gets you to Rainey, which was visited multiple times.  We will definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Didn't get to meet Geoff but everything went smoothly. I would recommend this place. The location is pretty great. Don't expect a view though. 
,,,,,,,,"Geoff was an great host.  The apartment is decorated beautifully and it's an awesome living space. A+ on cleanliness, space, and location... walking distance from great bars/restaurants downtown and quick ~$5 Uber rides to most other popular destinations.  Geoff was very welcoming and a great communicator, and it was very easy to drop off/pick up keys close by.  The best part was the flexible check-in/check-out, it was great not to have to carry bags around town before our flights etc.  Would absolutely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great! 

Geoff helped arrange access and answered any questions I had after I arrived. Nice location for that part of town. One note to plan for: Uber is challenged to find it even though it has a prominent address and is right by Whole Foods. Probably because it ends up being on more of an access road part of Lamar? 

It was very comfortable and it worked well for my business travel. Nicely appointed. 

Thanks, Geoff!"
5136751,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Awesome house. Laura, the property manager, was great. If we ever needed anything she was quick to respond. Went to Austin for a birthday party. House is walking distance to bars. Great place to stay."
,,,,,,,,The hosts were extremely responsive to our requests throughout the entire process.  The house was a perfect home base for our group and had many bars/restaurants within walking distance. Would recommend this place to friends. 
,,,,,,,,"The house was better than advertised. It was perfect for our party of four, who all wanted separate sleeping quarters. The common areas were so well appointed that even in a city like Austin, we didn't want to leave the house. Property manager Laura was exceptional to deal with throughout our stay. I could not leave a higher recommendation."
,,,,,,,,"We had the most incredible stay at Boho Chic! I went to Austin with 9 of my girlfriends. We could not have picked a better place. A quick walk to Rainey Street. Plenty of room to relax - We even cooked a full breakfast in the kitchen. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathrooms were so clean and spacious! I would highly recommend this property. Laura, the property manager, answered all of our questions within minutes and gave fantastic recommendations. Such a wonderful weekend! "
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome all around.  Our host made us feel welcome by staying in communication all weekend to make sure we had everything we needed.  The house is in a perfect location, and everything is exactly as seen in photos and described.  I highly recommend staying here if visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This house is beautifully decorated with a gorgeous yard.  The house  can easily accommodate a larger group. It's a quick walk to Rainey Street, where we ate a few of our meals. The neighborhood is quiet. 

Laura was very easy to communicate with and a great host. I would love to stay at this property again for my next trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Boho Chic was a nice retreat for 3 days.  The house is open and bright and the back yard is a nice place to relax in a private setting.  It is only a .5 mile walk to Rainy street, so no need for a car.  My only warning is that there are stairs to the upstairs (all bedrooms) and the decor is pretty hip, so probably not a first choice for older travelers.  Laura was our main contact and she is VERY responsive.  We were allowed both early access as well as a later check out.  We were all happy with our stay and our hosts!"
,,,,,,,,"The Boho Chic house was PERFECT for our bachelorette weekend in Austin! The house is exactly as pictured, loved the decor! We had a group of 10 girls and we all fit comfortably in the house, it was really the perfect size. We loved the outdoor space and spent a lot of time out there. The neighborhood was also great, the house is located on a quiet street and only a short walk to Rainey Street (about 10 min) where all of the action is. It was also a short uber ride downtown (5-10 mins).  Laura, the house manager, was extremely responsive to any questions I had up until our stay (and during). I would definitely recommend this house for a large group in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We were a group of 8 people and had a great stay!  Everything was decorated very nicely, beds were comfortable and the host / manager were incredibly responsive and accommodating. The outdoor space is great and the shares spaces are beautiful. Great location as well. Would come back and stay here next time we are in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"We were a group of 7 in Austin for the weekend, and the house was perfect for us. It's a gorgeous and very comfortable space - very modern and clean, and comes fully equipped with all the features you could ever want (wifi, cable, Sonos, a grill, fully equipped kitchen, etc.). Check in and check out were super easy and convenient, as the door is a keypad lock, meaning no key exchange was even necessary. The house manager also helpfully set up a extra air mattress for us. She was close by during the stay, and stopped by once or twice - I suppose that may come in handy if there are any issues, though we did get the slight impression we were being checked-up on (the house has strict rules against partying, excess noise, etc., including penalties).

The neighborhood is generally quiet and residential, but has a bit of a hipster vibe - there are a lot of cool and interesting bars, restaurants/food trucks close by, and the nightlife scene of Rainey street is also within walking distance. Austin is relatively compact so we never felt far away from anything, especially with abundant access to Uber and Lyft in the city. Overall this is a great place to base yourself if exploring Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything from the welcome package to the checkout instructions was clear and helpful. Gorgeous house with all the amenities you'd need. Dealing with Laura was fast, friendly, and easy. Can't wait to come back for another visit."
,,,,,,,,"I couldn't be more impressed with quality of this spot.  Kevin and Laura were amazing hosts and were there to answer any questions we had.  When we had a slight issue with the Nest AC system, Kevin was right there to assist.  The beds are extremely comfortable and the entire place is very clean & modern.  The location was perfect, just a short walk to the Rainey Street and other downtown locations.  If you are an Uber fan, rides are very well-priced from this spot.  I would absolutely stay here again and have already begun to look into future dates that might work.  Thanks to Laura for the constant communication and Kevin for the hands on assistance.  I highly recommend this location."
,,,,,,,,"The house was beautiful, convenient, and looked exactly as pictured in the listing.  Our group had a great trip, and the house definitely factored into that.  We did have a couple of minor issues (with missing fan remotes and a/c problems), but the house manager was quick in responding any time I had an issue or question."
,,,,,,,,Kevin was great host! The house is in an excellent location for experiencing Austin's culinary scene and close access to the river for trail running. The rooms are spacious and bright. There is a great attention  to detail that makes for comfy stay. Thanks for being a 5 star host! 
,,,,,,,,This is a great house in a perfect Austin location!...  Kevin has it decorated in an awesome way and we loved the openness and the patio area!!  The swings on the patio were great for hanging out!!  And - each room had a great different vibe to it - really loved that....
,,,,,,,,Very nice place!  Kevin was very responsive right from the moment of the booking and everything went smoothly! 
,,,,,,,,We had a great time at the Boho Chic house.  Very nice place with lots of space and close to downtown. Great for both the adults and the kids.  Thanks for a great weekend.
,,,,,,,,Awesome property great for a large group spacious enough that you won't be on top of each other. This is a great location to downtown.  Take advantage of the grill outside. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at this home for our Austin vacation. It is located on a quiet street not far from the fun of Rainey street and the highway. The house was very clean and everything we needed was easy to find. I would recommend this listing for any large group looking for a fun, clean, private place to stay while in Austin. Laura, was always available to help us if necessary and was very accommodating to our specific travel needs. She was also very quick with her responses to our questions throughout the booking process.

I would recommend this house to anyone."
,,,,,,,,First off the house is immaculate.  Seemed brand new and decorated in a very cool modern way.  Very updated and fantastic for our trip.  The house manager Laura was extremely responsive to all of my inquiries and responded in a very timely manner.  Would highly recommend Kevin's home.   
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic Space, Modern and comfortable, every thing you need to relax or entertain.  We were in Austin for work, but hosted a BBQ for our colleges that were also in town. I would go back any chance I get.

Kevin and his staff were super responsive and helpful. Thank you for hosting us!"
,,,,,,,,It was a perfect place. Honestly perfect.
,,,,,,,,"Came to Austin for a bachelor weekend with 4 other guys and stayed at this amazing house.  Fantastic design that rivals the most stylish boutique hotels, spacious, and comfortable.  It is well located just a few blocks from Rainey Street (easy walk).   Kevin was a great host, very friendly and responsive.  This was my first AirBnB stay and it was a perfect experience."
,,,,,,,,"Kevin was the perfect host, he was incredibly fast in his responses, gave clear instructions on how to check in/check out, and provided a small gift bag upon arrival.  We actually rented this house as well as the one next door and they were connected by a back yard.  It was a great space for a large group, I highly recommend staying here.  "
,,,,,,,,Kevin's place is incredible. It was perfect for our group. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"Our group of 10 for a bachelor party really enjoyed this house.  Kevin did an amazing job with the design of the home featuring great upgrades and even offered us a couple of extra aero beds for more comfort.  The house had a great back/side yard for us to take advantage of the Austin weather, play some bocce, bbq and relax.  We would definitely recommend staying at this home, or any of Kevin's updated houses.  "
,,,,,,,," This house was great for our group! Tastefully designed with all the upgrades! Large backyard with grill and tavern lighting...don't miss the Bocci ball set! Large bathrooms, great bedding and tons of natural light made this house a highly desirable place to spend a lot of time! I would highly recommend anyone making this their choice in Austin.
"
,,,,,,,,"Kevin was a fantastic host and has an awesome spot. The house is spacious and well decorated with great amenities (SONOS sound system, outdoor grill, nice master bathtub). The neighborhood is nice in that it is quiet but you are a short Uber away from tasty local eateries and bars (Juan in a Million, La Barbecue, and Cenote). Kevin lives just next door and is highly responsive to texts/emails. At the same time, he was highly respectful of our privacy. This house is great for groups given the large common space and intimate private patio. I would recommend this house (and Kevin) unequivocally. "
,,,,,,,,"Ten of us stayed at the Downtown Boho Chic Residence for my bachelorette party weekend and it was perfect.  The location was perfect - about a seven minute walk to Rainey Street, a ten minute walk to bars on East 6th Street, and a fifteen/twenty minute walk from downtown.  There was plenty of room for the guests and plenty of hang-out space - nice yard with overhead lights, large dinner table, and couches and chairs.  The house also came fully stocked with towels, which I didn't expect.  Kevin was extremely responsive to any questions we had and was very quick to pop over if something wasn't working.  I would definitely recommend this property to any large groups traveling to Austin. "

3163510,4.5,9,10,9,10,10,9,"The listing is a very convenient location and the perfect size.  It appears pretty much as pictured (except the porch swing didn't look as cozy and there was no table set to sit out front as shown but I'll blame that on the fact it's winter time!)  We rented the place at an odd time when the temp was 30s so the floor was extremely cold!  I'd recommend bringing slippers or wearing thick socks if you plan to take off your shoes during the winter!  The dining table was a bit wobbly also which became a nuisance when we were using it for meals daily.  As other reviews mentioned, you can definitely hear all the pitter patter steps of your upstairs neighbors.  Mild concerns but the overall stay was nice, so I would still recommend staying here :)"
,,,,,,,,Austin was an awesome city and Mireille's place was on a very good location. It was easy to go anywhere check Austin weirdness. We had a blast during our stay in Austin. The Skylark Lounge has the best Blues music We've heard in US so far.
,,,,,,,,Great place and easy check-in/check-out process!
,,,,,,,,Nice spot for being close to West 6th. Little small and living room lighting isn't the best but great for a quick stroll to sixth. 
,,,,,,,,"Very cute space and awesome location!
Mireille was great with communication as well."
,,,,,,,,"We were stoked to find this comfy little flat in the heart of Austin! Just steps from a couple of great restaurants and shops along famous 6th Street, we found it easy to get to most everywhere we wanted to go by walking. The apartment was clean, the sheets and towels were pristine, the bed was ultra comfy. There was some noise from the other units, but nothing major. Mireille was responsive to questions and made our stay easy as pie! "
,,,,,,,,Mireille was great - superb host.  
,,,,,,,,"The location was amazing, and easy to find! Check in was very easy and convenient. Mireille was a great host and responsive. "
,,,,,,,,"This property is in an awesome location, there is a cafe on the corner, Whole Foods down the street and walking distance to 6th Street bars etc. also pretty centrally located for most attractions. We used the Fasten app to get around which was great. The host responded very quickly to any questions we had. We would definitely stay here again that's for sure! The house was very clean, there is some construction going on behind the property but it wasn't a big deal. "
,,,,,,,,Very nice spot! We'd stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,Marielle was communicative and accommodating. She was very sweet and walked us through all the steps!!! My only advice to groups with more than 4 people is to bring an air mattress. 
,,,,,,,,"Nice spot in Austin! walking distance to stores, restaurants.  Clean.  Only complaint and luckily it was only for 1 night, but when there are people upstairs it is very noisy."
,,,,,,,,She was very quick in responses and accommodating our needs. 
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was such a great host and made the arrival to the home stress free. The home is located in the perfect part of Austin with easy walking access to quite a few great restaurants and parks. We brought our dogs to enjoy our anniversary with us and were a bit nervous about how that would go, but the house was very dog friendly. If you do bring your pooch just know there are a few boards down on the fence and the gate does not shut all the way, so I would suggest keeping them on a leash. The house was very relaxing and charming. Comfy bed, relaxing living room and very convenient kitchen. Staying at this house made for a very special anniversary and great stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The host was quick to answer questions and was flexible with the check-in time so that we wouldn't miss any shows at ACL our first day. Enjoyed the neighborhood and quick walk to Clark's Oyster bar and Whole Foods. 
,,,,,,,,"The place was clean. Location is OK.
Construction right outside the bedroom window and neighbors upstairs were quite loud so not the best of rests ever.
The deck and porch were not what were really portrayed... the place is a little dated. The bedroom door doesn't close and there are no curtains on the from door so not the most private either.
Impossible to find a plug to charge your phone unless you shift all the bedroom furniture to search behind beds and sofas. Bed wasn't the most comfortable.
For the price I was charged I really wasn't pleased at all with what I found."
,,,,,,,,"The description was very accurate and the apartment was clean.  Mireille was very responsive whenever I sent an email.  We did not have any issues with the door code.  The location was great and was about a mile from anything that we wanted to do. Overall, it was a good experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Solid place in a solid neighborhood. The place was safe and easy to access. The photos made the backyard look more appealing, but I can see why they are struggling to keep it cleaned up due to all the construction going on behind. It was a solid choice for a quick weekend in Austin. We felt welcomed and the information passed to us was accurate. Thanks to the rental team for having us. "
,,,,,,,,"Charming house in a charming neighborhood. The house location was perfect. We were able to walk to 6th street, 4th street, and to town lake. The house is pet friendly which is awesome! It was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. I didn't have to contact Mireille during the duration of our stay because she sent a very detailed email and we found a binder full of information when we got to house. Thanks for hosting us, Mireille. "
,,,,,,,,Mireille's place was perfect. it is in a great neighborhood next to lots of great things to check out. Mireille was very responsive. I would definitely book with her again in the future 
,,,,,,,,"I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews, but the place worked out great for us. Excellent location, walking distance to everything we wanted to do. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen was nice and functional. Excellent value for the money compared with other options in the neighborhood.

We did not hear any noise from the neighbors upstairs, but it did not seem they were home the 5 days we were there. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, within easy walking distance to Clarksville highlights. Nice to be able to walk to trader joes and whole foods. Lady bird lake and local public pools are within walking distance also"
,,,,,,,,Mireille was a good host and the home was as advertised.
,,,,,,,,"Not as advertised!  This home is in a very convenient location and could have a lot of charm, however it was not very clean and really should be advertised as sleeping 2 and not 4.  We had 2 teenage girls with us and the 2nd bed was a very cheap futon and it was extremely uncomfortable however the master bed was extremely comfortable.  We were very unlucky to be staying at the same time as very loud neighbors above.  The house does not seem to have much insulation and at 12 midnight it was so bad we could not sleep at all.  The outside of the house was very dirty with trash, broken glass and dog droppings everywhere.  All the lamps had been unplugged and we had to move heavy furniture just to get everything plugged in.  Many of the lights had burned out light bulbs as well.  Additionally, we came home one night to a huge mess caused by a bunch of rock, brick, cardboard and dirt that came crashing down from the chimney.  We tried to make contact but never heard back from anyone.  Also, there is noTV, just Netflix.  Overall we were not very impressed with the house but very impressed with the location.   "
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was very nice, I really liked the size of the front porch and back patio. The inside itself was slightly smaller than I expected, however the bed was comfortable. I found it slightly disappointing that the ice maker in the fridge and water filter was not functioning properly. I also was disappointed in the small portable air conditioner unit that was full of water upon arrival so it wasn't on. Overall the house was a good place to sleep, however the a/c was not great and not having ice made it not the best place to be in the summer. Also the house was very clean and well organized, the hostess and out of her way to provide us with a bottle of wine and some sweets. Overall some minor adjustments could make this a perfect little spot."
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place convenient to downtown Austin! Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,I arrived to find a bottle of wine and some candy on the table for me. I love when hosts put out a little effort! The house was very clean and everything I needed was there. Prior to my arrival I had asked if it would be okay to bring my small dog and if it would be possible to have a 5th guest stay a few nights. Mireille was great in allowing both without any hesitation in my request. The numbered key entry made coming and going super easy. I chose the house mostly in part for the location and that worked out perfectly too. I walked to WholeFoods and the liquor store without any trouble. The only down side was I wish the back yard had been more inviting but the inside was so charming it wasn't that big of a deal in the end. 
,,,,,,,,"The apt is the lower part of a duplex. I don't know if the upper part of the duplex is also an Airbnb rental but I was disturbed by the noise coming from above and in and out of the front door (some young guys who were very loud and slamming the door at 10pm, 2am). I guess you just need to go out a lot! There also seemed to be a lot of car alarms going off in the neighborhood. It is in a fantastic location to 6th street, a park and several shops/restaurants. There was some coffee, 1 Corona and bottle of wine and some chocolate provided which is thoughtful. Not sure if there was cable?  There was a guide in folder but no remote? There is Netflix which is awesome. Keyless entry is good but I could not remember 10 digit code code and had to keep my phone on me at all times. Responsive host when I contacted her regarding a leak.  Would stay again.  Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Location is excellent, within easy walking distance to restaurants on West 6th, Lamar and West Lynn. Also easy to get to Hike & Bike trail on foot. Place was clean, adequate, but still needs some work. Bed was comfortable; futon bed mattress too thin to be comfortable. Kitchen is fine. Back yard is not inviting, hard-packed dirt, a bit trashy, aside from the seating area shown in photo. And yes, easy to hear upstairs neighbors.
Highly recommend the Winflo restaurant on W 6th."
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was an attentive host and made sure I had all of the info necessary. I loved the book of close by restaurants and activities. The Fire TV stick was a nice addition (we love watching Netflix and Amazon Video!). The house itself is cute and nicely decorated. It is in a nice neighborhood, close to downtown. 

There was a small leak in the kitchen when we arrived. I texted Mireille responded immediately and she had the contractor come by the next day while we were out. Unfortunately, the contractor left a mess. There was dust and drywall everywhere, he did a poor job of cleaning up. He took the only kitchen towel, so we were left to use the bath hand towels. We found Lysol wipes under the sink and used those to wipe up the dust on the counters and floor. Dust was all over the dishes and utensils too. Additionally, the only garbage can in the whole place was a tiny one in the bathroom. 

We had unit A, unit B is the second floor. The group of young men were extremely loud. The floors and walls were thin, so we could hear their conversations and every footstep. 

The unit was clean upon arrival, however, the bed did not seem as clean as the rest of the unit. Sheets were cleanish - the pillows and sheets had an old/sweaty smell but did not appear to have been slept in. The shower is strange and did not have any shelving to put our toiletries on. 

Mireille is a great host, but there were lots of little things about our stay that contributed to a not-so-great stay. 

"
,,,,,,,,Great location! Clarksville is such a great/walkable area. The house is clean and newly renovated. Only drawbacks- The beds weren't very comfortable (2/5 rating) and the walls are very thin so you can hear the neighbors above and beside you. Both things that can easily be overlooked for a weekend in Austin so close to downtown. Thanks Mirielle! 
,,,,,,,,Mirellie's place was lovely and all freshly remodeled ! The new kitchen and floors were great! She was very responsive and thorough with check in/ out instructions and overall was very pleasant to communicate with. The location was near the quieter end of 6th street.
,,,,,,,,"Very fast responses. Place was very nice and a great location - walked to downtown easily.  She has a place for you to hold your stuff if you arrive before check in, just like at a hotel, which is not something I've ever seen at an Airbnb before! It was extremely helpful."
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was incredibly responsive and helpful. The house was pretty much as advertised. It is in need of a few minor renovations (plumbing in the kitchen, some grout and molding in the bathroom). The backyard was nice but could use some TLC. 

Overall we were pleased with our stay. The house is close to everything but far enough to be seperate from any chaos and noise."
,,,,,,,," For the price we paid, we were expecting better.
 3/5 stars

Good:
The location is great, and it was clean.  Bed was comfortable.  Private parking in driveway.  Welcome gift.

Not so good:
The outside patio is covered in decomposed leaves, and there are unhooked christmas lights strung and falling down making an anchor for numerous cob and spider webs.  A far fetch from the outdoor pictures on the listing. They must be quite a bit older.  Missing doorknob meant you could not exit bedroom to the kitchen if the door was shut, so we just had to leave it open.  I tried to adjust two separate blinds, both were broken, gave up after that.  Dehumidifier was shut off because the tank was full at arrival, we had to empty.  Lamp in bedroom didnâ€™t work, used a flashlight.  Light bulbs in living room were bright white fluorescent kind if that annoys you like it does me.  We were warned the sofa bed was broken before arrival.  Understand stuff happens and did not factor that into the review.  Bathroom is off the bedroom, so if 4 people are staying you must cut through the master bedroom.  

All of this would not normally of been mentioned in my review, but lots of little things add up.  This property needs a little work put into it to bring it back to 5 star status. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in this cute little house! Awesome location, super cute neighborhood,  and pretty walkable to everything. It rained the whole weekend, but Netflix and a front porch swing made it great. "
,,,,,,,,"Great stay , I highly recommend it 
Tres bien situÃ©, propre, cosy, literie super confortable, trÃ¨s bon accueil. Endroit parfait pour dÃ©couvrir Austin, je reviendrais avec plaisir 
Merci Mireille "
,,,,,,,,"This house is great -- perfect location!  Very comfortable place, clean and nice.  The bed was very comfortable, and the shower had great water pressure!  No complaints here.  We could not figure out how to close the dishwasher, but other than that everything worked and was great.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great spot! Clean, comfy and close to everything!"
,,,,,,,,Mireille was so wonderful! This Airbnb was in a perfect location to explore the city! Everything about our stay was wonderful! The outside seating area was a highlight! We walked many places and were easily able to find our way back to the Airbnb. Would stay again!!
,,,,,,,,"Mireille made us feel welcomed. It's a cute apartment on a quiet street. It was smaller than we thought, but true to the pictures. Walking distance to Whole Foods and cafe/restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,The house was in a great location and was very nice.  It is very close to a lot of restaurants.  You can walk to a lot of places.  I would highly recommend and would stay there again.
,,,,,,,,It was a great experience. Everything that we needed was supplied to us. There was a great location towards downtown and a friendly neighborhood. The owner even left some rasinets and wine for a nice touch.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a short weekend stay bring chrome cast if you want to watch TV though.
,,,,,,,,Great apartment. Easy walking distance to lots of cute restaurants/shopping.  5 mins to most of the stuff you want to do in Austin. Seamless process getting in and out. 
,,,,,,,,Awesome experience! Mireille was an excellent host and provided anything required for our stay. Great location. Neighborhood has a lot of character. I would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"This was the most effortless AirBnB experience I have ever had. Mireille's house was the perfect home from home. The bed was suuuuper comfy, the neighborhood had tons of great shops and cafes near by. I will 100% be returning for all work and play trips to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location, nice and cosy appartment! We were able to bike everywhere from the appartment. Thank you!! "
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was an extremely accommodating host. She was responsive to  texts and was always helpful to answer questions.

The listing was nice and quaint. The neighborhood was very nice, for being in the heart of a major city it was extremely calm and quiet on our street. The location of this property was certainly the best part of it! Right around the corner from the massive Whole Foods HQ, couple blocks from Austin's unique Hope Graffiti Gallery, and a 15 minute walk to nightlife-central 6th street.

I definitely recommend checking out this place on your next value-filled Austin trip."
,,,,,,,,Had a great weekend in Austin. Mireille left some great recommendations for places within walking distance. Unit was as described and having a private access code was great. Would stay here again next time I'm in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Easy to get downtown. Whole foods close by with a huge prepared foods section, so great for a work travelers. The coded lock made it easy to arrive at my convenience. "
,,,,,,,,"The house is as described - convenient location, nice bed/pullout couch, clean. The host left wine and treats for us, very sweet! We enjoyed the neighborhood - walking distance to a nice coffee shop and the HOPE outdoor gallery. Had some issues with the upstairs tenants and noise, which the host was quick to resolve. "
,,,,,,,,"Location: Awesome, a short walk (0.5mi?) to the west part of 6th st and downtown Austin. We actually walked all the way to the heart of 6th st, which is a shade over 1 mile. Neighborhood is quiet and seemed very safe.

Parking: Tons of it. there is a slab next to the house, but we always parked right in front on the street. Seem to be no restrictions, our car was there basically 24/7 for a week.

Amenities: Super comfy bed, and a pullout sleeper in the living room is great for extra guests. Kitchen has everything you'd need to cook, but we didn't use it - you should be eating at the great restaurants anyhow! : )  It's worth mentioning (since I didn't see it in the description) that there is an iron and ironing board, along with a small mattress suitable for a child. All in all, way more than I'd expect to be at an airbnb."
,,,,,,,,"An accurately described listing in a lovely area of town. It was great being so close to activities and the green belt. The added amenities were nice - Netflix, clean linens and even a bottle of wine when we arrived! 
I was surprised when we left to receive an inquiry about damages, but the issue was resolved quickly and professionally, which was greatly appreciated.  
Thanks for a great visit to Austin, Mireille! "
,,,,,,,,Mirielle was welcoming and quite helpful. The apartment was clean and the location is fantastic. You are close to everything.
,,,,,,,,"Cute little town home for a short weekend get away. Met our expectations, would rent again if in town."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice old home with awesome character and a super comfy bed (!) and great host communication --a lovely stay in Austin!

Austin quickly became one of our new favourite cities :) Thanks Mireille!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful location.  Close walking distance to Whole Foods and downtown Austin.  Quiet neighborhood.
,,,,,,,,"Mireille's place was great! It was exactly as described. In a great location, very quiet, exceptionally clean with everything we needed for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was great. Everything I needed to make my stay in Austin very comfortable. Super easy booking, access and departure. The apartment is exactly like the photos. The biggest surprise....? The bed. Wow...amazing doesn't do it justice. It's almost worth renting Mereille's place just to sleep in that bed. Pure heaven. Overall great experience.  "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was lovely, a little bungalow in West Austin. Neighborhood was nice and quiet and just a quick Uber ride to downtown, South Congress, etc. Perfect for two of us. Plus the bed was so comfy!!"
,,,,,,,,Wow! What an amazing house to soak in the Austin life. Mireille made sure we were comfortable and was easy to communicate with. Her house was so close to the city which was perfect for us to enjoy 6th st on Halloween. I would definitely recommend this place to everybody. 
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was a great host, very attentive and responsive. The house was great, exactly what we needed. Perfect location and easy access, the laundry was a huge help too! Couldn't have asked for a better value. Would recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,The house is very well situated near downtown Austin in a quiet neighborhood. All the facilities work and it was clean and well organized.
,,,,,,,,"Great little place, quiet area and close to a lot of great places.  A little tight with 4 but enjoyed the stay"
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was great at sending over all the details about the property (how to get in, etc) and left a lovely bottle of wine and some chocolate for me on arrival. The place was as described, cozy, clean and had everything you could possibly need. It was also ideally situated - 5-7mins walk to Whole Foods as well as other stores and restaurants.
 "
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay, and such an amazing location! That bed was delightful and the porch swing was so cute. I would definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,"Although Mireille was not there to show us around, she was with me every step of the way through text and through email. Everything was detailed and I definitely didn't have any additional questions because of all the adequate information about the apartment! My friends and I were in town for a wedding and this was a perfect location next to all the hotspots in downtown Austin (food + bars around a 15 min walk or a few mins uber ride).

Everything in the apartment was perfect, we immediately felt at home. A few times the upstairs neighbors would walk in heels or make lots of noise that you can hear from the downstairs apartment, but personally, it doesn't get too loud to be a problem. If you're extra sensitive to this, however, I suggest bringing ear plugs! "
,,,,,,,,We had an amazing time in Austin and this home was absolutely perfect for our family! Was super close to everything down town and weather was perfect! Never had an issue getting in touch with Mireille through out our trip!! We will def be coming back again!! Thanks Mireille 
,,,,,,,,"Great place for a home base Austin! Everything we wanted to visit was 10mins away. The place was perfect for our group of 3, the bed is super comfortable. I would definitely return and stay here!"
,,,,,,,,Really great place to stay. Pleasant exterior and yard. Very clean and minimalistic interior. House is also really close to a lot of great shops and restaurants on Congress St.  
,,,,,,,,Nice little house close to 6th street. Comfy bed + sofa bed. Convenient location & quiet neighborhood. Minor problems with the bathroom due to the fact that it's an older house but overall good experience. 
,,,,,,,,"Mireille's place is charming, in a wonderful location, and she is a very responsive host.  Aside from a minor mechanical mishap (dishwasher was inoperable), our stay there was perfect, and the porch swing was a special treat!"
,,,,,,,,Good times!
,,,,,,,,Perfect!  Great location and home.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment suits basic needs, other than electrical issues with the ceiling fan(s). Great location, walking distance to several adorable places to eat."
,,,,,,,,Nice place and close to all commodities. 
,,,,,,,,Very welcoming neighborhood and experience.  We will definitely be back.
,,,,,,,,Good location. Mireille was very responsive.
,,,,,,,,"Â¡Â¡Nos encantaron nuestras vacaciones en Austin!!. Mireille nos recibiÃ³ con vino y chocolates y respondiÃ³ muy rÃ¡pido todas nuestras dudas. Los consejos fueron muy Ãºtiles. Fuimos a Clark's Oyster Bar y Â¡Â¡todo estuvo delicioso!!.

Todo fue perfecto: el barrio, la casa, la limpieza y la atenciÃ³n. 

Muchas gracias Mireille. Espero podamos regresar pronto :)"
,,,,,,,,"Our first Airbnb experience was really great.  Mireille is a great host - we felt welcome the moment we walked through the door. The accommodations were perfect - and like all the past reviews, the most comfy bed ever and the house was clean.  From the mouths of my girls ""the shower/water pressure is awesome.""

This was our first Airbnb experience. We locked ourselves out (purse in the house w/ my phone & car keys) in the first 10 minutes.  Note to self: print/pocket the entry code. We were able to get in touch with Mireille (yay for my teen with a cell phone) through having her download the Airbnb app, problem solved quickly!  

We were in town for a college visit to UT, but wanted to get more of a feel of Austin outside of being hotel guests. The location was perfect - we walked to 6th street for coffee, dinner and took a short drive to SoCo to browse shops and eat there as well.  We swam at Barton Springs in the morning, and my two girls kayaked on Lady Bird Lake. A whirlwind quick trip, but able to enjoy the city, food, scenery, and get a taste of the best of most things - will be better when the girls older and can listen to great music at some night spots.

If my daughter ends up going to UT, we will have to book this place for our weekend visits. Hook 'em.
"
,,,,,,,,"Super cute place. Lots of character. Fantastic location. Exactly as described. We slept 2 adults and 2 kids with no trouble. Street parking was always available right in front.  Mireille had everything ready for us.  There is an electronic lock with a code, so keys were not an issue, even with my late night arrival. I will look to stay here again when I am back."
,,,,,,,,"Our experience with Mireille was wonderful. She contacted me the week before to let us know the key code. Upon arrival we were surprised to find wine and candy to start our girls weekend. Everything was clean and worked perfectly. There was coffee and towels, the bed was incredibly comfortable. Mireille made it clear that she was available for any questions we had. "
,,,,,,,,"The home, neighborhood, and hospitality were great. Very clean and cozy home."
,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent location from great food, nice hiking, and local stores.  It was also easy access from the Mopac and CapTex Hwy.  I enjoyed the stay and would certainly book here again."
,,,,,,,,"Cute and very convenient place to stay. The bed was extremely comfortable and the AC was awesome considering the 90+ temperatures outside.  Walking distance to many Austin eateries, bars, and shops.  Mireille was very accommodating.  "
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful time! We had a blast! The home was in a great location, and the bed was amazingly comfy! Mireille was so sweet and helpful! We will definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,Mirelle is very responsive and the pics and description of the unit are accurate. Great place to many walking venues.
,,,,,,,,"We loved this apartment! Mirielle was great and very responsive when we had questions about some work being done outside. She also recommended restaurants in the area, including an oyster bar a couple blocks away - we ate there everyday! The location is great and you can walk downtown if you want, but you also have everything you need right nearby. Having the Whole Foods down the street is so convenient! Plus, the bed was SO comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"Mireille's place has a great location. It was very easy to access the house and it had a very cozy feel. Mireille was also very responsive to any quick questions I had. High security deposit, but overall it was a pleasant time."
,,,,,,,,"The host made us feel welcome by leaving a little gift, the neighborhood was adorable and close enough to everything you want in Austin but not noisy at all. "
,,,,,,,,"This was my second stay with Mireille. Austin had suffered a lot of damage from severe storms and flooding. The unit had some water damage in the kitchen - the ceiling was leaking when we arrived. Mireille had informed us of the damage the day before our arrival and a contractor was supposed to have fixed it before our arrival. Unfortunately this had not happened. The until was very damp with an unpleasant smell. I contacted Mireille who had her contractor come and take a look the next day. They also put in a dehumidifier. It was better but not that great. 

The unit is feeling pretty run down at the moment. The sofa bed is almost on its last legs I think and was pretty uncomfortable for sleeping. I'm not sure I would choose to stay there again. Mireille is very responsive to any request however and the unit is in such a great location. "
,,,,,,,,"Mireille answered any questions I had in such a wonderful timely manner, the location was close to everything and clean. We were able to reserve the upstairs as well as the downstairs for our family for Graduation time ! It worked out fantastic !! We received all necessary info about the front door access code well in advance and had no problem checking in ! I would definitely stay here again !!"
,,,,,,,,"Although my stay was short, this lovely home made for a great home base while in Austin. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment was very spacious. I also appreciated the proximity to downtown Austin. If/when I come back I will most likely book this place again. 
Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"mireille was very responsive to any questions that i had, and gave me a great list of various activities, restaurants, and great neighborhoods.  The Cottage is in a fairly quiet area, yet is very close to the downtown area and public transportation.  

simple decor and a large enough space to really feel at home.  Did not utilize the kitchen, but it seems that most things are available."
,,,,,,,,"Had a fantastic weekend in Austin with my wife and two small dogs at Mireille's place. We received all necessary info about the front door access code well in advance and had no problem checking in after the drive from Houston. Inside, we found a convenient list of local walkable bars and restaurants and a welcome bottle of wine. Z'Tejas, Josephine House, Whole Foods, and several other bars, restaurants, and Austin hotspots are within easy walking distance. We also walked through Zilker Park and down to Barton Springs with the dogs, leaving the car behind.

It's a triplex, so the back yard is shared. It's a huge yard and was fully fenced for the dogs. The home is in a beautiful, hilly neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,The place was extremely well located and the property was clean and just adorable.  Communication with the owner was flawless and I highly recommend this property.
,,,,,,,,House was within walking distance of several amenities. Host also left recommendations for restaurants and things to do. 
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Mireille's for 5 days. The apartment was basic but clean and functional, the bed was comfortable, and the kitchen was well-equipped. We particularly enjoyed the front porch swing, and the location is excellent - it is in a lovely neighborhood, and it is walkable to Whole Foods, to many restaurants and coffee shops, and to the main drag downtown. As others noted, you can hear just about everything the other Air BNBers do upstairs, through no fault of theirs - there is just very poor sound insulation between floors. So if you're a light sleeper, plan on earplugs. The combination of location, cleanliness, and price was excellent, and I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,The home was great and the perfect size for my friend and I. It was completely clean and had everything we needed to navigate and enjoy our time in Austin. We especially enjoyed the swing on the front porch. The neighborhood was quiet and in a good location. Many solid food choices in the area. Mireille was a fantastic host and was extremely flexible by allowing us to checkin 4 hours early. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"This house was in a good location and very well kept. We were in town visiting for the weekend and certainly enjoyed our stay. There was an issue with some people in the neighborhood entering the property while we were gone, however, which made for a bit of an uncomfortable atmosphere. Outside of this incident, the residence was very enjoyable. "
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was quick to respond to our requests. We had a problem with the tenants upstairs having a dog that barked and whined all night the first night we stayed there. 

I informed mireille and she dealt with the situation promptly. The tenants had the dog there without her knowledge. She was also kind enough to refund our first night fee in compensation for the sleepless night. We really appreciated her efforts. 

We enjoyed the flat and in such a great location. We traveled with our twin toddlers and there was plenty to do within walking/ biking distance. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and easy coordination in getting everything set.  We really enjoyed our stay.  
,,,,,,,,"The host was very responsive and helped us out a lot, emailing back quickly while we were on site and being accommodating to our needs. The house was what the description indicated it would be. "
,,,,,,,,"This location could not have been more perfect!!  It really is close to everything in Austin, and the house itself is very well kept and spacious.  I love the keyless entry and easy street parking!  It's perfect for one or more persons!  I highly recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,The experience was fine. The apartment was clean and the host was organized.
,,,,,,,,This was a nice and easy location for downtown Austin.  Quiet little place to stay.  The location was very clean and had all of the essentials.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking to stay in downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,great location and everything was super easy!
,,,,,,,,"Great location and a nice place to stay. The neighbourhood is interesting and really convenient for downtown. The house is fairly basic but well equipped with pretty much everything you could need. The rental is the ground floor only so we heard some noise from the neighbours above, but not late at night so this didn't disturb us. If more than two people are sharing this rental, be aware that the bathroom must be accessed through the bedroom.
We found Mireille very responsive and helpful and would certainly consider staying here again."
,,,,,,,,"this place is a cozy and cute little spot in a great part of town.  Miereille was super helpful and was nice enough to leave us a bottle of wine and some chocolate. always a bonus! Staying here was great because you can walk to all the nearby stuff on 6th street, plus a few other locales that aren't much further. it has everything you need for a weekend away or a short business trip or whatever brings you to Austin. 
My one complaint isn't even really a complaint, but a comment. If you're someone that wants to sleep late on the weekend and can't handle a little noise, there are tenants upstairs with a young child. This wasn't really an issue for us, but this is an older house and there isn't a lot of insulation in the floor. They weren't that loud, but if you're looking for the quiet and sterility of the Hilton, this place probably isn't for you. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location in nice neighborhood. This is a basic vacation rental - no frills but adequate. If you're a light sleeper, this may not be the place for you as the walls and ceilings are paper thin. The backyard and driveway are shared. "
,,,,,,,,"I booked the space for a quick stop through Austin on my birthday; I never met Mireille, but everything was taken care of, and it was easy to gain access. The house is pretty bare bones, but it covers the basic needs, and it's only about a mile out from downtown, which is nice. "
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was super accommodating as we were stranded in Austin due to the blizzard in Chicago.  She was easy to communicate with and attentive to our needs.  The place is as described, all the conveniences we needed.  The bottle of wine was a nice touch.  I was hoping for some poutine, but I'll have to make arrangements next time for a future visit. :)"
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved staying at Mireille's apartment.  It was clean, comfortable, and wonderfully located within walking distance of lots of bars/restaurants and attractions - and she even left us a bottle of wine and a snack.  Would definitely recommend to anyone else visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,The house was exactly as described. A perfect location & lots to do within walking distance.  Mirielle was a very organized & communicative host.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was amazing and it all started with Mireille's wonderful welcome with chocolate and wine. The cozy home is just as described and the location can not be beat. It was roomy enough for our party of four and within walking distance to many Austin must-sees, including several tasty restaurants, bakeries, and cafes. "
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I had a great stay in Austin for a cold week in January. While we never met, Mireille was a great, accommodating and responsive host. She quickly found our weak spot with a bottle of wine and chocolate awaiting our arrival. 

The home was convenient to the WholeFoods and a number of nice little restaurants. The apartment is one of three units and for any light sleepers, like me, be warned that the walls (and ceilings) are somewhat thin and you are at the mercy of the other tenants with regards to the ambient noise. That being said, the king-sized bed was a marshmallow dream.

The apartment furnishings are a touch sparse and the overall feel is that of an efficiency rather than a cozy home. But for the price, location and amenities, I think it's fair to say that you get what you pay for. "
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was very accommodating and made the stay very comfortable! We were here for a quick weekend getaway and the space was perfect for the two of us. 

The space itself was very clean and it was a nice extra touch to be greeted with chocolates and wine. 

We did have a car, but chose to take cabs at night and the location was very close to everything. We spent little to no money getting to the nightlife of Austin. 
 
I would recommend staying here to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"Accurate description, greeted with wine and chocolate.  Great experience and very comfortable place."
,,,,,,,,"It was great! Wonderful location, clean, comfy bed, free wine and chocolate, coffee, free easy parking...which is always welcome. If I was to be picky, I would say that it was a little bare. Definitely not lived in, not much character, plain. But I WOULD recommend this place. Thanks!!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful little place with great location. Thank you Marielle!!!
,,,,,,,,We needed a place to stay last minute and Mireille was very accommodating! The wine and chocolate that awaited us was so nice after a stressful day of traveling. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Our host, Mireille, was great! The place was as listed. I am very satisfied with my stay here. Next time my friends and I come back to Austin, we will definitely be staying at Mireille's place!! Right in the heart of downtown and walking distance to 6th St. "
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was a great host and her apartment was just as described...charming, cozy, and in a fantastic location! My sister and I made the trip to explore Austin more from a ""local"" perspective and Mireille provided fantastic suggestions on places to visit and eat. Mireille does a great job of creating a home away from home for her guests. "
,,,,,,,,"Bottle of wine, candy, & a welcome binder"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent neighborhood, quite and residential in downtown. Nice cottage for getaway in Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,Very walkable to a great part of Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was extremely prompt and well organized. The suite was just as we had hoped - clean, comfortable, and in a great location. I would recommend this listing to anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at Mireille's. Her communication was incredible and replied to every questions so quickly. We had an amazing stay, especially because everything was made so easy by her. The location is amazing as you can walk to many different places in Austin. We'd definitely stay here again!
"
,,,,,,,,We had a great night here! It was clean and comfortable and in a great location! I wish we could have stayed longer!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at place! The neighbourhood was nice, quiet and residential. And it was also close to 6h street to walk.Also the place has a beautiful front porch with a swing to relax after a long day or night of exploring the city!

Mireille left us some recommendations to visit with contact information and everything we needed to know. Before and throughout our stay Mireille always responded very quickly to the odd question. Excellent host!"
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was an excellent host. Upon arrival there was a bottle of wine and some chocolate for us, as well as a binder with recommendations for food/drink in the neighborhood, wifi network and password, and all the guidelines clearly listed. The rental was in a great location, perfect for easy access to Zilker Park for Austin City Limits, within walking distance to a bevy of stores and restaurants, but also nice and quiet which allowed for some great nights of sleep. The porch and back patio were excellent for sipping coffee in the mornings or relaxing at night before going to bed. All in all, we had an excellent experience and would strongly consider returning if ever back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Mireille was a great host.  Plenty of well thought out information was provided before arrival which made us feel welcome and safe.  The place was just as we had hoped, cute and clean.  The neighborhood was perfect....just far enough from all the bars to be quiet, but not too far from the fun.  We would stay again---no complaints!!"
,,,,,,,,Mieille made sure that I had everything I needed. The house was great! I felt very safe with the keypad lock system that is used for the house. The bed was so comfortable and the shower/bathroom was very clean. Great location and walking distance to 6th st. and whole foods! I will stay here again when we visit to Austin.
15240567,5,9,9,10,10,10,10,Jeddy is an amazing host. The place is beyond beautiful and very comfortable. I recommend his place to anyone who wants to explore the city and live in an excellent area. I will definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"J was very accommodating and helped us get settled in last minute (first airbnb host cancelled last minute). It was our first time in Austin and this place couldn't have been in a more perfect location. Nice neighborhood, close to restaurants, bars, and a Whole Foods as well. "
,,,,,,,,Nice host. Loves to get to know his guests beforehand. Very close to downtown and all of the nightlife. No complaints! Worked well for a couple exploring anew city!
,,,,,,,,J's place was very modern. The amenities at the apartment complex were top notch! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location in the middle of downtown Austin.  I was able to walk to all the downtown bars and restaurants and there was a Central Market and Trader Joe's a block away in opposite directions.  I had great access to both my office and my clients office while traveling and would highly recommend this location to any of my coworkers who travel regularly and are tired of crazy downtown Austin hotel prices that offer little in the way of amenities.

J was a great host and met with me to walk me through the basics of building access and parking.  He was very responsive throughout my stay."
406911,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,In a quiet neighborhood yet near a local park and restaurants. Also within walking distance to south Congress shopping. 
,,,,,,,,"Can't recommend Cynthia and Jim's apartment enough!!
Such lovely people who welcomed us warmly and put so much thought into our stay. The apartment has so much character, is in a super convenient part of town and don't get me started on the massage chair - the very definition of pampering and luxury!!
Thanks again Cynthia and Jim!"
,,,,,,,,"Great little studio that's just far enough from the city center to be quiet, but not so far you can't walk or take the bus to get around easily. "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and her husband Jim were very welcoming, as were their dogs Che and Tango. It was a true B&B experience. We loved the homemade banana bread, which was perfect with our morning coffee. The welcome basket and provisions in the fridge were also a nice touch. The location was great. There were some awesome restaurants within a couple blocks and we were able to walk to So. Congress, just a little over a mile away."
,,,,,,,,Cynthia and Jim were the most hospitable and awesome hosts that anyone could ask for! Everything was very clean and comfortable plus the location was great for walking/exploring the city. Will have this place on the top of my list for any return trips to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Exactly what I wanted, and the location was even better than I expected from looking at maps. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was such a great host!  The best I've ever had!  We had a basket of treats upon our arrival, including clementines, snack bars and dark chocolate.  The fridge was stocked with beer, yogurt and water, and she even had baked us fresh banana bread!  It was still warm when we arrived past midnight and Cynthia was at the door to greet us and introduce her friendly dogs.  The apartment itself is comfortable and artsy, located in the back of the house with is own entrance.  There is a delightful screened in porch with festive lighting at night and a beautiful breezy view of the garden during the day.  A perfect place to do some work if you have to.  Wifi was great, bed was comfy and there was even a massage chair!  We enjoyed cable tv too.  Great place to stay and location was convenient.  We got bike share bikes at the station 2 blocks away and biked all weekend."
,,,,,,,,This was a great place to stay and excellent location. Great neighborhood feel and walking distance to great restaurants and access to river trails. Hosts were very accommodating and provided many extra touches that made us feel right at home! Must stay for Austin!
,,,,,,,,"My BF and I came for a little food and music exploration and had a great time staying at Cynthia's place! All I can do is echo the praises of the other 5 star reviews: it's homey, excellent location, and Cynthia added Bed & Breakfast touches like daily (!) fresh made coffee, pastries, snacks, and towels that really saved us time and money, which we greatly appreciated. I loved reading on the porch (which is attached to Cynthia and Jim's kitchen) and listening to the wind chimes in the morning. Also, at a hot time in Austin, the apartment was always a perfect temperature and had a fan for added coolness. Having a parking pass available was great for our rental car, too. All in all, a peaceful, lovely stay. They're not kidding about that Southern hospitality thing :) "
,,,,,,,,"We came up for weekend two of the Austin City Limits festival. The AirBnB studio apartment is close to Zilker park and only a quick walk/ride away from South Congress. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, the apartment itself was delightful and our hosts made us feel right at home."
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful stay, on my first visit to Austin. Cynthia and Jim are a delightful couple who have obviously put a lot of thought into making guests comfortable. The space is lovely and well-equipped. I loved the high ceilings, and private entrance through peaceful garden and screened porch. The location worked well for me - I was able to walk to dinner and music on South Congress or Lamar, and the pedestrian bridge to downtown (at Lamar) was also very convenient. I'd happily stay there again."
,,,,,,,,This was our second time staying and our stay was just as enjoyable as last time. Cynthia and Jim are great hosts and are incredibly welcoming. Would highly recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,Cynthia and Jim were great hosts! They were so kind and welcoming and left everything we could need. They even left a loaf of baked bread for us! They were super friendly but definitely gave us privacy. The house is also within walking distance of a ton of great stuff to do and in a super central location. Would highly recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,"This was an outstanding stay. I couldn't have asked for a kinder host! The listing's in a great location, clean, well stocked with drinks and snacks, and a comfy bed!

Cynthia is fantastic. Quit looking and book this room!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia & Jim were great hosts!

They are very friendly people and we had a great welcome conversation, talked about things to do in Austin, BBQ recommendations and New York (Jim told us some great stories from his time there).

Cynthia is a pro when it comes to that banana bread! So good.

The place was comfortable, we had everything we needed and we had a great view of their beautiful garden. Served us really well for our short stay. You can easily get around using a ride-sharing service (we ended up using Ride Austin)."
,,,,,,,,Great location and very hospitable hosts. The massage chair really came in handy!
,,,,,,,,We have a great stay at Cynthia and Jim's place. They were warm and friendly and offered many suggestions. The apartment is cozy and in a great location. Che and Tango (the two dogs) are adorable. 
,,,,,,,,What a great stay. Lovely hosts that clearly want to make sure you have a nice stay. All the little extras really make this more of a bed and breakfast experience than most AirBNBs I have stayed at. A real treat.
,,,,,,,,"We had the most amazing stay this weekend! It began with the most gracious hostess, Cynthia, who was very patient with us arriving late, due to personal issues we were having. She did not make us feel bad, but instead, we were greeted as if we were family â¤ï¸ The room was stocked with every amenity possible, plus it was high quality, earth friendly, products. It was obvious tht she and her husband Jim, have thoroughly thought out how to make their guests feel the most welcomed, and comfortable during their stay! (Including a gift basket of goodies, cold Shiner beer and water, and fresh baked blueberry bread) The location was perfect, with so many activities, events, and restaurants within walking distance, tht we ended up not even moving our vehicle! We were blessed to have found such a gem, and definitely plan on returning! Thanks again, Cynthia and Jim "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim's place in Austin was perfect. I was in town for the Bar exam and was able to find their place just a 5 minute, safe walk from where I needed to be each morning. The place was quiet for my studying needs, very clean, and came with coffee available every morning, tasty snacks, and two friendly therapy dogs! Cynthia and Jim were super nice, very helpful in assisting me getting around Austin, and were incredibly knowledgeable about things to do in the area. I would recommend their place to anyone looking for a safe, quiet, convenient place to stay in the Barton Springs area in Austin. I really enjoyed my stay and hope to stay again if I'm back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This AirBNB was perfect. Our host was very accommodating and even offered us blueberry pancakes for breakfast :) The room was clean and the fridge stocked. The massage chair was amazing! The house itself was located in a great part of town. Next time we are in Austin, we will definitely try and stay here again! We wish we stayed longer than 1 night! "
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a great experience here! Cynthia goes out of her way to make you feel at home - think banana bread, beer, chocolate, etc.  The location was perfect and close to downtown, Rainey street, and Barton Springs. "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim (and Che and Tango) were excellent hosts, and we had a wonderful stay in Austin. They made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived - bedraggled from a trans-Pacific flight with a 2.5 year old. Everything, from a loaded coffee machine each morning, to a gift bubble-wand for our daughter, made us feel like family friends in town for a visit, rather than strangers passing through. The accommodations were clean, comfortable, and the covered (and bug screened) porch was perfect for breakfasts and evening meals. We can't recommend staying with this wonderful family enough, and we look forward to the next time we can think of an excuse to come to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim's apartment is great for a quick getaway. It had everything you could need and is definitely true to Austin's style. Convenient to South Congress, South Lamar and Rainey St. Would definitely come back."
,,,,,,,,"A truly amazing experience!   We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the comfortable, cozy apartment that was complete with morning coffee, a personalized welcome, snacks and shiner in the mini fridge! Everything we needed  was within walking distance from the studio.  Jim and Cynthia were amazing and we are so grateful we had the chance to stay there during our quick getaway to Austin!!"
,,,,,,,,"We had such an awesome stay with Jim and Cynthia. The location could not have been more convenient to the Palmer Event Center and some great parks and restaurants.  Our hosts went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed (including umbrellas, which were very convenient during some rainy weather) and were always available for a food & entertainment recommendation. It was also great waking up to a fresh pot of coffee every morning. We definitely hope to return for our next Austin trip!  "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were incredible hosts! Very warm and welcoming, they always had a few Austin tips help us make the most of our stay. The welcome banana bread was delicious! And they went above and beyond by gracing us with wine for my birthday. The neighborhood felt very safe and hip, and the apartment itself was very comfortable; we immediately felt at home! All in all it was a great week and we hope to return! Thank for having us!! :)"
,,,,,,,,Cynthia and Jim (and the dogs) were so welcoming and gracious. The place is in the perfect location walking distance to so much you'll want to do in Austin and they made me feel right at home. I had a fantastic time!
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim have a comfortable, well situated, and special place in the heart of Austin. We truly enjoyed our stay and their company as well. They were gracious hosts, great conversationalists and gave us many recommendations for exploring the city. Cynthia even made us some delicious banana bread! The room was comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. The adjoining porch is a serene escape for easy relaxing and excellent bird watching. We heartily recommend staying here while in Austin and we hope to return!"
,,,,,,,,"The Blooms' property is the perfect blend of quirky artistry and all home comforts. Everything we could want was provided including a well stocked fridge, fresh coffee daily and Cynthia's delicious pumpkin bread. It was all very clean, comfortable and well organised. Che and Tango gave us a great welcome whenever we returned and the position of the property is brilliant for exploring central Austin and beyond. Cynthia was a great communicator. Thank you all for having us!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying here was awesome. The home was super cozy, and they provided anything we could possibly need while there. Cynthia and Jim are incredible hosts "
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I loved our stay with Cynthia and Jim!
The little back house was very comfortable and provided us a perfect launching pad to explore Austin.  The garden was beautiful and the screened in porch was a charming place to start our day with coffee and Cynthia's homemade bread.  There are plenty of walkable restaurants, cafes & bars and the river and parks are nearby.  Plus Cynthia and Jim are awesome hosts.  When I mentioned that my wife and I wanted to explore different live music venues, Jim printed off a whole list of places and gave us a great review of all sorts of different acts.  Then when I left a couple things behind Cynthia was kind enough to mail them back to me.  Overall this is a wonderful place to stay in Austin and we looking forward to our next trip back."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia's place was a perfect launching pad to explore the city: walking distance to downtown, Ladybird Lake, and south congress st. Her freshly baked banana bread upon arrival was greatly appreciated. She was also easy to get in touch with when needed. Definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Jim and Cynthia were so welcoming and fantastic! The space was beautiful, stocked with every little detail and nice extras. They go above and beyond to make your experience a good one. So thoughtful and knowledgeable about their city. Gave fantastic recommendations of things to do. Cannot wait to go back!"
,,,,,,,,Phenomenal hosts -- Cynthia and Jim. I enjoyed my stay thoroughly 
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was extremely welcoming. I felt very much at home and the space was comfortable and spacious. Lots of nice touches like yummy banana bread, strawberries and bottled water. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was close to everything! I was welcomed by both Cynthia and Jim. Cynthia made amazing bread for my arrival. Also, there was a welcome basket, juice, bottle water, beer, breakfast bars, and clementines. The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner and soap. Jim gave me great recommendations for live music. Overall, couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. So inviting and welcoming. You have a separate entrance so I felt as I could come and go as I pleased and would not bother anyone. Thanks Cynthia and Jim!! If I ever come back to Austin I will definitely be staying here!   "
,,,,,,,,"We could have not been more pleased with our recent stay in Austin with Cynthia. Everything was wonderful from her genuine hospitality to the homemade bread, fresh coffee and a mini fridge that was stocked with all the essentials a weary traveler is in need of. The accommodations were clean, well kept an very comfortable. The location was centrally located and within walking distance to a beautiful park along the river and downtown Austin. We look forward to staying with her again in the future. Thank you Cynthia!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Step right into the photographs. That's what you'll do when you stay with Cynthia in her charming bungalow at the corner of Dawson and Daniel. Cynthia and her sweet Aussies greeted my boyfriend Joe and I at the gate, then led us back to a screened-in porch and into our room. It was light and airy, with a cool breeze wafting through the windows. She gave us a quick tour, then left us to enjoy our stay. 
The kitchen doubles as a bathroom, and everything was neat as a pin. We discovered the fridge was stocked with yogurt, juice and two Shiner Bocks, plus a basket of oranges and cereal bars sat on the dresser, just in case. 
In the morning, we walked out to the porch to find a pot of coffee ready to be brewed, Austin magazines and brochures to thumb through and a plate of scrumptious homemade bread. It was such a delight to plan our day on the porch and listen to the wind chime.
I highly recommend staying with Cynthia. Regretfully, I didn't have a chance to check out her jewelry (she's a designer). Next time!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a wonderful place to stay: such a great location, close to everything in the city center, but still incredibly peaceful, comfortable and relaxing. The massage chair and absolutely gorgeous wind chimes were truly appreciated. Cynthia and Jim are terrific hosts, easy, welcoming, full of helpful guidance for our visit, very generous with the space. We really enjoyed meeting and talking with Cynthia and Jim. Without hesitation, highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were friendly, conscientious and so helpful! From our first moments in Austin, they gave us great advice and added wonderful personal touches. Fantastic location -- walking distance or less than a $10 Uber ride to anywhere you'd want to go. Also, Cynthia baked pecan pumpkin bread! "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were fantastic hosts who made us feel very welcome! The place came as advertised -- clean, comfortable and with a charming ""Austin"" vibe. We were pleasantly surprised by the screened-in porch were we could sit and drink coffee in the morning. The private entry to the apartment is around back, so we felt very comfortable coming and going as we pleased. It was just a lovely experience with wonderful, friendly, interesting hosts. Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were delightful hosts. They struck a great balance between present & welcoming (popping in to say hello, being available for a friendly convo in the morning) and giving us our space. The apartment was cozy, private, conveniently located, and bargain priced. The pumpkin bread was delicious. Their dogs, Che & Tango, were sweethearts. 

Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy and Jim were great! Cindy is super responsive with questions and messages, and Jim was delightful. We arrived late at night, and there was a note left for us with keys and instructions. They left some fresh OJ, drinks, and pumpkin bread for use in the morning (I brought some cookies for them as well (I love food exchange!)). 

The apartment was as cozy as described. Their dogs are also very good with people. Strong recommendations all around. "
,,,,,,,,"Location, location, location! Loved staying in this neighbourhood. Close to everything; south congress, 1st street, downtown, parks, and the trails. A small place but the screen porch right outside your door makes it feel spacious. Cynthia and Jim are so friendly. They really made us feel at home with drinks and snacks stocked in the studio. "
,,,,,,,,"Overall: We had an extraordinarily wonderful time staying with Cynthia and Jim. They were incredibly welcoming and communicative from the very start and have a very comfortable and clean place. The location is well situated - walking distance to most main areas of commerce (we consider ourselves good walkers), though taking an Uber around was also very easy and affordable. And we just adored our hosts. Couldn't speak more highly about them and the accommodations. Definitely a can't miss place!

Our Welcome: We had a very warm welcome from Cynthia and Jim, who greeted us with pumpkin cake and an offer of margaritas. We were also welcomed by their friendly pups, Che and Tango, who were incredibly friendly and well-behaved. Cynthia provided us with a ton of resources to get us started on planning our time in Austin, including the local paper (which included events) as well as their own compiled list of top things to do in Austin. Additionally, they were ready with recommendations for how to start our first day/evening in the city, which just happened to be Halloween.

The Place: The in-law apartment was just as advertised - comfortable, cozy, and with plenty of room given that we spent 90% of time outside (I guess, besides the sleeping part). The bathroom was clean with a great shower (good pressure). We enjoyed having the little patio area outside where we could sip coffee/tea in the mornings and enjoy the outdoors (without being completely outdoors and exposed). Cynthia and Jim brew up coffee every morning, which hit the spot!

The Location: The location is very well situated to get to things on South Lamar, 1st and South Congress. You can easily walk there, though it may be easier (and still relatively cheap) to take an Uber/Lyft around. We loved walking around - it was typically an easy 15-20 minute walk to get to some good areas of commerce, including across the bridge to the downtown/6th street area. For us, this was perfect - right in the middle of everything and a good home base.

Our Hosts: Hopefully, you got a good picture from our description above. Cynthia and Jim are amazing hosts - very kind and welcoming and armed with good information about Austin. But they were also very considerate with our privacy too (we just enjoyed spending time with them). Definitely reach out to Cynthia to check out the jewelry she makes. We found some great gifts for our moms. Oh, and their dogs are awesome. "
,,,,,,,,Cynthia and Jim have a beautiful home and were wonderful hosts.  Their place is a short 5 minute Uber ride downtown. The coffee and homemade pumpkin bread were delicious. This has been my best Airbnb experience yet!  
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time with Cynthia and Jim! Super accommodating and we even got some tasty pumpkin bread along with tons of local recommendations to check out! Thanks, y'all!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were the perfect hosts. So kind, friendly and generous. My husband and I could not have had a better experience. Anything we might have left home without was provided and Cynthia's banana blueberry bread was such a treat! Within walking distance to Zilker Park and great restaurants.  "
,,,,,,,,This was my first time using AirBNB and Cynthia and Jim were perfect hosts. They were both very friendly and welcoming. The room was actually bigger than we expected and was very comfortable - and Cynthia's homemade banana bread and their comfortable massage chair were the icing on the cake.  I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking!
,,,,,,,,"A perfect, cozy location, with easy access to downtown Austin. We had coffee every morning, along with some delicious blueberry bread.

It was exactly what we needed for our stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia & Jim went over & above in attending to every need I could ever have. I was greeted with fresh banana bread, Trader Joe's snacks, juice, bottled water and more.  The location just blocks away from my conference and I walked every day. It's also just one block from Austin's self-serve bicycles, which I rented and biked the Lady Bird Lake Trail for over two hours.  I could walk to delicious restaurants just across the street. And I'm writing this review from the incredible massage chair.  I'm definitely staying with Cynthia & Jim anytime I return to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Cynthia and Jim were super hosts. They provided banana bread and a basket of treats for our arrival. The apartment itself was clean and cozy and in a great location. It only cost about $7 by Uber to get where we needed to go. I'll echo the other reviews and say that using the massage chair is an absolute must. We'd definitely stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time staying with Cynthia and Jim! The apartment is very comfortable and is located in a very quiet neighbourhood with easy links to downtown Austin. It also has everything you could possibly need and more! Cynthia was great at keeping in touch before we arrived and both her and Jim gave us some really useful tips about where to eat and what to do in Austin. We enjoyed chatting to them and fussing their beautiful dogs, who were very well behaved. 

I'd highly recommend staying here and we hope to do so again! Thank you so much for making our stay in Austin so enjoyable :)"
,,,,,,,,"What a great experience! I felt so welcome and relaxed after being greeted with fresh flowers in the room and lots of snacks and drinks. I wish I could have spent more time with Jim and Cynthia. They treated me like family. The space is great and having a washer and dryer was awesome! The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The location was perfect! A short walk to restaurants, Barton pool, and day spas. I would recommend staying here to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"BEST AIRBNB EVER

Host: Cynthia and Jim were amazing! They were extremely accommodating and hospitable. They stocked the fridge and baked homemade blueberry banana bread for us when we arrived. They also arranged for us to leave our things both before and after our stay due to our super weird flight schedule. When they found out we were celebrating our birthdays they even gave us birthday cards and flowers! They are incredibly kind and their Aussie Shepherds are just as sweet.

Place: The studio is charming, with lots of sunlight streaming in from the garden. The bed was very comfortable, and the space was just perfect for two. The small kitchenette allowed us to store snacks and make a few meals. It was very clean and filled with amenities. The screened-in porch was really relaxing - perfect to listen to some music (and frogs) and sip some wine or start your day with tea and their beautiful backyard view.

Location: Being a 20-something couple, this was perfectly ideal. A quick walk to Barton Springs and the park. An easy walk or bus ride across the river. And a short ride south to SoCo. The street itself is residential and quiet. The best of everything!

TL;DR: This awesome couple host will ensure your stay in their charming studio filled with amenities just around the corner to basically all you need to see is absolutely perfect."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was a fantastic host! Everything was exactly as advertised, from the great welcome basket of snacks to the homemade banana bread and massage chair (which my boyfriend and I were fighting over each day, it was so relaxing!). This was my first time using AirBnb and if all hosts are as great as Cynthia I will be sure to use it again and again!"
,,,,,,,,"One of our best AirBNB EXPERIENCES EVER!! Cynthia, Jim, Tango and Che were our favorite host by far. We barley left the massage chair. Would recommend this place to anyone. The location is perfect and we will be back. "
,,,,,,,,"The designation ""Superhosts"" does not truly begin to describe Cynthia and Jim. Not only were they warm and welcoming hosts, but they went out of their way to make sure that I was comfortable during my stay in Austin to take the bar exam. Both Cynthia and Jim took time out to get to know me while still maintaining a respectful distance during my stay. I felt as though I was staying with old friends rather than strangers.  

Besides Cynthia and Jim being fabulous hosts, the apartment is lovely. I felt very much at home with all of the amenities provided (the massage chair will be your best friend), and the location cannot be beat! I easily walked everywhere I needed to go, whether it was Downtown for dinner or to a coffee shop on South First. I highly recommend this apartment if you are in town for an event at the Palmer Events Center. A five minute walk down the block and you're there - a major perk for someone who is perpetually late like myself.

Overall, I cannot say enough wonderful things about my stay. I would (and will) recommend Cynthia and Jim's apartment to anyone visiting Austin. You will not be disappointed!"
,,,,,,,,Host was very nice. They made a very nice banana and blueberry bread. Very quiet room with all the amenities anyone can ask for. Nice location in relation to the city.
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were amazing hosts! We had the perfect trip to Austin, largely in part to their hospitality.  The little extras...(including banana bread and other breakfast items) made us feel welcome.  They really go above and beyond for their guests!  We enjoyed the neighborhood and the location was perfect.  We walked to all the main attractions in Austin easily, and at the end of a long day of walking, the massage chair was heavenly! I would definitely recommend staying with Cynthia and Jim, we had a wonderful time!!!"
,,,,,,,,My partner and I stayed 5 nights and loved the leafy and central neighbourhood location and the accommodation. Cynthia and Jim's hospitality was second to none and they went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. We would recommend this to anyone wanting a comfortable stay with easy access to the Austin neighbourhoods with the most character. Cynthia's famous banana bread also was our saviour most mornings :)
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim are superb hosts.  Cynthia called the night before I arrived, left a detailed note for me with all the information I needed, and baked delicious blueberry-banana bread!  Cynthia and Jim are very generous -- the refrigerator was stocked with drinks and yogurts, and a basket of snacks was on the dresser.  The apartment is lovely and comfortable.  Among the best aspects of the place are the screened-in porch (excellent bird song in the early morning!) and the massage chair!  The location is excellent -- it's within walking distance of a number of good restaurants, including El Ana, which makes delicious breakfast!"
,,,,,,,,"I booked a short stay for my parents. Cynthia and Jim were great hosts and made sure they were comfortable. Convenient location, yummy snacks, a comfortable bed, good coffee, and a nice rain shower were just some of the great amenities that were included. I would definitely keep this place on my short list for places to stay in the future. "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was outgoing and friendly but never intrusive. It was a pleasure to get to know her. She provided fresh coffee every morning and baked a delicious banana blueberry bread which she left for us. The room was attached to the house but very private. Location was perfect, very close to the restaurants and shops of South Congress. I would stay with her again any time. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first time staying at an Airbnb. We really liked our experience here. Specifically, we liked the massage chair, and the ceiling fan that did a good job keeping us cool overnight and the room was a very comfortable temperature. We enjoyed the little touches, including the free, delicious banana bread, and having a fridge stocked with some goodies (a few beers, some juice, some yogurt, etc.). It had a nice shower, too, with good water pressure that heated up instantly, something not every place we stay at provides. We also liked the neighborhood. It was near South Congress street, and walking distance to things like Barton Springs (granted, like a 20-minute walk, but still). Area was also quiet, so you don't hear the revelry you hear closer to downtown.
One con is we would have preferred more opaque curtains or blinds. You are in the back so fairly private, but it would conceivably be possible for a neighbor to look in. Also, the dogs were friendly and we liked petting them, but I'm a light sleeper and one night I did wake up when one of them barked. My wife didn't and it only happened one night, but something to be aware of if that is important to you.
Overall, we really enjoyed the place and would heartily recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"Second time here and once again amazing experience. Cynthia is such a gracious hostess and there are such unique and hospitable touches like coffee ready every morning, a massage chair, relaxing wind chimes ... The works! I cannot recommend this place enough! Super communicative too...awesome."
,,,,,,,,"We (two of us) stayed a week at Cynthia and Jim's apartment and had a great time.  The space was just as described and our hosts couldn't have been more accommodating.  We very much enjoyed talking with them and they were a wealth of information about the area and gave us many good suggestions of places to go and directions for getting there. Cynthia is a wonderful cook and prepared some delicious treats for us. If you like dogs, you will want to kidnap their two and bring them home when you leave. For us, the location was ideal.  It was close to many attractions but in a nice, quiet residential neighborhood. There was a little traffic noise but it was not at all bothersome.  If you enjoy walking, nearly everything in town is reachable by foot.  We downloaded the Uber app and used Uber cabs for transportation when we didn't want to walk.  During the day, Uber is fast and a very affordable way to get around, but be aware their prices go up dramatically on busy weekend evenings.  All in all, we would definitely stay there again.  And, try the massage chair.  It is great after a day of beating the pavement."
,,,,,,,,Lovely location and great massage chair! Cynthia was very attentive and kind. Would stay again. Thanks Cynthia! 
,,,,,,,,"Great experience.  There was delicious banana bread when I arrived, and Cynthia and Jim were actively accommodating.  I'll be back."
,,,,,,,,"Wow, what a wonderful experience! Cynthia, Jim and their son Brendan went above expectations to make us feel welcome in their beautiful home, located in the most charming area in Austin. Drinks, snacks and a freshly baked banana bread were expecting us when we arrived, and we had fresh coffee every morning. The bed is really comfy, the apartment has all the amenities one could need and - ah - that massage chair, the best treatment after a tiring day!

Would definitely stay again!!"
,,,,,,,,"We fell in love with the entire Austin experience and were able to walk to most of our destinations from this cozy little cottage.  Our hosts were very charming & friendly, as were the dogs. Cynthia & Jim left us welcome snacks and coffee every morning. We recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay at Cynthia and Jim's lovely little cosy place, they were so friendly, welcoming and helpful while the accommodation itself suited all of our needs. The location was also perfect - a 10/15 minute walk away from the wonderful South Congress area, which is cool and happening all year round, but especially vibrant and fun during SXSW. The neighbourhood was fantastic too, nice broad, tree lined trees and beautiful houses, the 15 minute walk either across the bridge into the downtown area or in the other direction towards South Congress was pleasant and easy. Cynthia and Jim are a brilliant couple to stay with as they were really helpful and informative about the local scene and area. Plus Cynthia's now legendary home made Banana bread was a delicious treat that we couldn't get enough of. All in all we had an incredible time and will definitely be back there again in the future. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were awesome.  Communicative, flexible, fun and interesting, respectful of privacy.  I love dogs, and have one, may be helpful to mention dogs will be around (some people are not pro dogs) in would highly rec this place to anyone!  She even had fresh banana bread when I arrived!  Rick stars In the BnB world!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was AWESOME. She and her husband were super friendly, and Cynthia even baked fresh blueberry banana bread. YUM. The check-in/out processes were seamless, and the home was LOVELY. Seriously awesome experience during SXSW.  "
,,,,,,,,Cynthia was very welcoming and had also baked some banana cake. Unfortunately my trip was cut short and was quite caught up in the conference and hence could not enjoy her lovely garden/ porch. house is a healthy 1 mile plus walk from downtown. Nice cosy place
,,,,,,,,"Great spot in an excellent location. We rented a car for our trip, but it's walkable to a lot of good food and bars. 

Cynthia made us feel very welcome, was a generous host and offered good suggestions on what to do in Austin.  Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim have the perfect place to stay if you are looking to stay in downtown Austin.Â Â I was in town for the week on business, and their apartment was a wonderful place to stay. My fiancÃ©e joined me for the weekend, and we found the location to be the perfect walking distance to delicious restaurants, shopping, and downtown Austin, where a music festival was going on. The weather was usually cold, but the apartment was always warm and inviting. The bed is comfortable to sleep on, there is a sink, microwave and fridge, as well as a wash and dryer if that is needed. Jim and Cynthia were wonderful hosts, as well as their friendly Aussie dogs. Cynthia was so kind as to stock the fridge and have snacks available in the room- she even baked us a huge plate of fresh banana blueberry bread! They are a fantastic couple with a wonderful apartment. If I return to Austin, I will definitely try to stay with them again."
,,,,,,,,My stay at Cynthia and Jim's was everything I had hoped for. They were wonderful hosts. Their home is centrally located so I was able to walk to the Austin Convention Center and the cool shops on South Congress. Homemade sweetbread was the icing on the cake.
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia is friendly and welcoming and the apartment is great! It's a great neighborhood with quick access to downtown, Town Lake, and the hotel/convention area. I was there for a conference and could walk to the hotel each day. 

The apartment was comfortable and cozy. I loved sipping coffee on the screened-in porch!

Thanks Cynthia! I'll definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim's lovely place totally made our Austin vacation! The space is beautiful, the massage chair is a GREAT bonus, the two Aussies are the sweetest dogs and Cynthia is so hospitable - she even made us banana bread! We had such a great time and can't wait to be back in Austin :)"
,,,,,,,,"I have stayed in many fantastic airbnb places, but this one maybe took the prize. Cynthia and Jim are gracious, generous and welcoming hosts. The apartment feels like home since the moment you walk in: it's cozy, comfortable, has everything you might need (the goodies left by Cynthia are such a nice touch!), and is packed with (Austin) character. The location is perfect -- right next to the Lady Bird Lake, and walking distance from both 6th street and SoCo. Breakfasts on the porch, and the massage chair after a long day are the cherries on this cake."
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I stayed in Cynthia and Jim's studio for 5 days as we explored Austin for the first time, and it was outstanding. We didn't rent a car, and the location was perfect: 5 minutes' walk to South Lamar, where so many clubs and the Alamo Drafthouse are located (the Drafthouse is a 15-minute walk; places further south are easily reached by bus), and a 20-minute walk to downtown via the Lamar Bridge or the 1st Street Bridge. The Congress Ave bridge (of bat fame, though not in January) is just a little further east. The happening South Congress area is also a 15- to 20-minute walk. 

Cynthia and Jim's studio is cozy and comfortable--exactly as pictured. There's a microwave but no stove, which wasn't a problem for us since Austin is an amazing food town. And Cynthia generously provided all kinds of goodies: Shiner Bock beer, juice, yogurt, nutrition bars,tangerines, coffee every morning, and best of all, her delicious homemade blueberry bread. And Jim was a fountain of knowledge about the music scene--we might never have known about the gospel brunch at Maria's Taco Xpress otherwise! 

I'd happily come back and stay here, and highly recommend it to a single traveler or a couple. 

Get a Cap Metro bus app and a 7-day pass (inexpensive), and you can get anywhere in the central Austin area. 

P.S. Cynthia's jewelry is exquisite, if you're looking for a special memento or a memorable gift."
,,,,,,,,"Place was as advertised. Many amenities were provided, including fresh bread, coffee and snacks. Very comfortable environment to stay in and a nice neighborhood as well."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim's place was great! We stopped by in Austin for a few nights and had a really wonderful time. The hosts were very helpful with tips on where to go for music and food. The place is located in a convenient, central location and it's got everything you could need. 

The dogs were very cute too!"
,,,,,,,,"My state with Cynthia and Jim was great. Comfortable bed, great location and very welcoming hosts! I loved waking up to fresh coffee and Cynthia's banana bread!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place in a great Austin neighborhood, and great hosts who made us feel most welcome. Morning coffee with Cynthia's fresh baked bread and birdsong makes this listing special. Jim and Cynthia are well versed in the Austin music scene so they can offer excellent recommendations for live music venues as well as local restaurants. Stay here and Help Keep Austin Weird!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were the great hosts. They were informative and helpful with any questions or concerns we had.  Cynthia even made us blueberry bread! Yuum!

The bedroom was clean and comfortable. Definitely would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything about our stay with Cynthia & Jim was fabulous! When we arrived, delicious homemade blueberry bread was waiting for us, along with a refrigerator & basket full of yummy food & drink.  The accommodations were charming, & the room was stocked with everything we needed for our stay. Jim & Cynthia were so friendly and welcoming to us, and were available & accessible every day.  They were quick to respond to texts and always checking in to be sure everything was fine (without being intrusive and always respecting our privacy).  Both of us fell in love with the wonderful massage chair in the room!  It was pure heaven on earth!  We also appreciated all their suggestions on places to eat and shop and local entertainment.  They are such a sweet couple.  We highly recommend this B&B and would stay there again without hesitation!  "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were spectacular hosts! Upon arriving we were greeted with fresh baked bread and refreshments in the mini fridge. 

The space was clean and cozy and even included a massage chair. I would love to come back just to stay with such awesome hosts!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were very welcoming hosts.  Cynthia was quick to respond to email queries before my arrival and then in person.  The dogs were very friendly too!

I spent very little time at the property and needed a clean place with a comfortable bed - I got that!  The property was as described and as, per other reviews, there were nice touches such as providing snacks and delicious banana bread.  
Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim have a beautiful home with a welcoming studio apartment in the back. It was exactly as described, with a few perks we were not expecting but greatly appreciated, such as delicious chocolates, a variety of tea bags and a small pair of scissors which came in handy to snip off wrist bands from one of the local bars. The pumpkin blueberry bread was amazing and made the morning coffee that much better. This was our first airbnb experience and we loved it. We will definitely stay here again when we visit Austin and will recommend it to friends!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia's place is perfection and completed our ""Austin experience!"" She and Jim made us feel right at home -- she even made us an amazing banana bread! The space was clean and welcoming - the bed very comfortable and all the amenities we could need or want were available. Plus, the location rocks! WHEN we go back to Austin, we would love to stay with them again if they'll have us! Thanks Cynthia and Jim for your warm welcome and amazing accomodation. "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time using AirBNB and I am so glad I did. If you need a place to stay in Austin, I would definitely recommend staying with Cynthia and Jim, who are both amazing people. I never felt like a stranger while I was there. Their dogs, Che and Tango, were incredibly sweet and only wanted as much petting as possible, which I was only too glad to give them.  
The room was very comfortable and larger than it appears in the photo. I did not get to explore as much around the neighborhood as I would have liked, but I took Cynthia's recommendation and had dinner at the Mexican restaurant about 100 steps away from their home. The food was amazing. 
I am definitely looking forward to my next conference in Austin and, hopefully, another visit with Cynthia and Jim. I was more comfortable staying with them than I would have been at any hotel."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim are wonderful hosts. This SoCo studio had everything we needed and more. It was so comfortable and within walking distance to a lot of places. We stayed for Austin City Limits and I doubt we could have found anything closer! It's a fun 15 minute walk to Zilker Park but also a short walk to downtown. Parking was also really easy - just out front.
Thanks for having us, we enjoyed meeting you and your two furry little friends. "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were excellent hosts. Great accommodations: the bed, the screened porch, the blueberry bread and stocked fridge (which was super helpful bc we got in late). Perfect location close to so many things. Cynthia and jim greeted us when we got in and offered great recommendations on places to go, things to see, etc. Wonderful airbnb experience, I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again if I'm lucky enough to make it back to austin. Thank you Cynthia and Jim!! "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was an amazing host! She gave us detailed instructions about parking and entry to apartment before we got there. She greeted us at the front gate and provided a welcome letter, snack and coffee for the next morning. All-star host couldn't have had a better time!"
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Cynthia's wonderful home. She had provided all of the amenities we needed and even baked some homemade bread for us. The bed itself was extremely comfortable and we also really enjoyed the outdoor patio. Finally, the massage chair in the room was heavenly. I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"We spent 3 nights in this cozy soco apartment and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We arrived rather late on the first night so to be able to start the next morning with warm home-made banana bread and coffee, ready with a single push of a button, was invaluable. 

The place was just as described and generously stocked with beverages and snacks. The location was exactly what we were looking for and central to most all we wanted to do.  The absolute BEST part of this accommodation is the host and hostess; both of whom are gracious and lovely people. Their recommendations for fun and off-the beaten path places to go, was exactly the kind of travel we were looking for. 

Thank you both for a great experience! If we head back to Austin we will certainly stay with you!"
,,,,,,,,"We've stayed at 5 Airbnbs during our cross country road trip this past month and this one may be our favorite! 

The location is great! If the wind is just right, you can smell the bbq wafting over from Terry Black's. It's just a quick walk away (close enough so you can be rolled home!  ;-) 

You have compete privacy in the back room with your own full bathroom. There's also a stocked mini fridge. We loved the healthy snacks (freshly baked bread! Very tasty) and natural bath/cleaning products. Both nights we were there, I made use of the massage chair... One word: bliss! 

There are two very friendly australian shepherds that added a pleasant, homey touch. 

Last but certainly not least, Cynthia and Jim were the consummate hosts. Very friendly, but non-intrusive. They provided a personalized welcome letter with great tips. When we come back to Austin, we will definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"My 4th grade daughter and I spent 4 days at this wonderful bnb. Our hosts were very gracious, personable and helpful. There was extensive information on things to do around town as well as each and every amenity of the rooms. We were very comfortable and felt very at home. 

Thank you Cynthia, Jim, Tango and Che!"
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I stayed with Cynthia and Jim for several days recently during the middle of July. For our arrival, Cynthia had baked some awesome blueberry pumpkin bread for morning breakfasts. They also had a dorm-size refrig stocked with yogurts, beer, waters and juice! The bed in our studio was very comfortable and sitting out on the screened-in porch during the morning was very relaxing. And, the automated massage chair in the studio was great!

Both Cynthia and Jim were friendly (and offered great tips on dining, things to do) but weren't intrusive. All in all, we had a great stay and would highly recommend you visit!"
,,,,,,,,We had a fantastic time here and Cynthia was so fantastic and welcoming.  She even left us some home-baked and other goodies for us as a welcoming gift.  The location of the house is perfect on a beautiful shady residential street a stroll away from some great bars and restaurants and Austin B Bikes which we used constantly. The screened porch is awesome and perfect place to relax.
,,,,,,,," Cynthia and Jim do not need another rave review because they have so many. Their home is wonderful and they are so welcoming. Their house is in a perfect location, right next to a bike share making the rest of Austin easily accessible. It was the perfect place to escape to after a long day, and Cynthia's blueberry bread might have been the best thing we are the entire trip. Thank you for making our time in austin wonderful.  "
,,,,,,,,Had a great time. Very accommodating and helpful with suggestions for activities and dining. Lived the decor-very charming. It's was especially nice to have breakfast of the home made banana bread and juice!  Bed was comfortable and we got plenty of use out of the message chair. Bike rentals a block away made local travel cheap & easy. Helped me burn off my food calories!!
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim are fantastic hosts. Their apartment is lovely and comfortableâ€”just what I needed while I was in town for a conferenceâ€”and the neighborhood is quiet, charming, and convenient. Cynthia had thought through every aspect of the experience, with helpful instructions and personalized information even before arrival, and gave useful local tips when I arrived. I took a lot of the advice and was glad I did. Personally, Cynthia and Jim were so friendly and went out of their way to be generous and welcomingâ€”I'm lucky it happened to work out for us to have a couple conversations: they are both fascinating people as well as great hosts.

I hadn't expected to use the massage chair, but boy am I glad I did. Nothing better at the end of a long day. Or the beginning of one. Or both."
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay with Cynthia and Jim. They are very welcoming and helpful when it comes to visiting Austin. Even if you think you know what you want to see, pick Jim's brain. He'll be happy to share, and it's all worthwhile.

The place was comfy -- I picked it partly because of that massage chair, and BOY! am I glad I did! I used it at least twice every day, and it really helped after a long day of walking around Austin. One thing you can't see in the photos is the lovely high ceilings. Between those gorgeous windows and that high ceiling, the place is very spacious-feeling (not that it's small in really any way). The attached private bathroom was also spacious and had everything you'd want (including a hairdryer -- I never know whether to pack one or not). If you accidentally leave anything at home, I think you'll find that Cynthia has provided it for you.

Each morning, you step out your door onto the lovely screened-in porch, press a button, and in a few minutes, you have delicious coffee. Cynthia's banana bread lives up to its reputation, and she also stocked the fridge with yogurt and juice (and half and half for the coffee). 

If you're feeling leery because of the dogs, don't. While they will be somewhat excited to see you at first, they are impeccably behaved and very friendly, and they're never an issue (I could've seen them more, in fact, because I was missing my own dog). 

Another point to consider: I found Austin to be a little more spread-out and less pedestrian-friendly than I'd thought, and wanted to rent a car (also because I really wanted to see San Antonio, a little over an hour to the south). There is a very friendly, fast, and affordable Enterprise rental center just about 3 or 4 blocks away, so you can easily pick up a car from this airbnb location without incurring any taxi fees. I was very glad we did that. (And if you do rent a car, go visit Gruene -- trust me!)

As a last note, be sure to eat at Torchy's Tacos. There's one within walking distance of Jim and Cynthia's. Their tacos are creative without being annoying, and tasty beyond belief. Get some of their roasted corn and some La La's Lemonade, too, there. Trust me on this!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim's place was absolutely wonderful. They went out of there way to make their place as peaceful and homey as possible. Some of my favs were the homemade blueberry bread, the Shinerbock's waiting in the fridge, the porch, the coffee - and yes, even the massage chair (I was a little doubtful but it was amazing.)

They were more than helpful in giving suggestions on places to visit, eat, etc. Funny enough we actually made it to quite a few. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. They were fabulous :)"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location for the studio, close to downtown and Barton Springs. Lovely hosts and charming dogs. I had a short, excellent stay with Cynthia and Jim and I would highly recommend the place to anyone. There was coffee and a croissant for me in the morning! Very nice touch. I felt at home in the neighborhood. El Alma is right across the street, and it was the best Mexican food (and margaritas!) I had during my stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"What a great host! Cynthia made banana bread for us and pointed us to all the hotspots. The room was clean, roomy, private, comfortable and well-stocked, and the neighborhood is close to plenty of great stuff. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place to stay! It's easy to find, central to a few very fun neighborhoods, and has easy access to a lot of excellent food and drink. The neighborhood is relatively quiet and you will wake up every morning to birds singing in the trees outside.

The apartment itself is very cute and comfortable. There's a lot of light, the futon feels like a bed (I slept like a rock every night) and there are drinks, snacks and delicious homemade blueberry bread. Cynthia and Jim are very welcoming and will provide tips on places to go, and their dogs are wonderful and friendly.

I was very happy with the apartment, the hosts, the neighborhood, the city of Austin and everything! I'd highly recommend staying in this apartment when you visit Austin. Also, the massage chair is pretty amazing."
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay. The first night Cynthia presented us with a fresh baked bread, which we noshed on with the yogurts, coffee and OJ for the rest of our stay.  Nice snack basket with some crackers, energy bars, and tangerines for that snack you know you need.  Comfy, cosy, and just great.  Exactly what an air bnb stay should be.  ideally located, too.  Austin has a new bike share program, and there is a stand 5 minutes from the house.  and the dogs are wonderful too!  You will love your hosts, too. They know EVERYBODY (my friend Mark from Chicago, they knew his local store!).  "
,,,,,,,,"Quite possibly the best location in Austin, walking distance to downtown, Zilker, South Congress and more. Studio was clean and we loved the massage chair after a long day of playing outside. Cynthia and her husband were super nice, too -- and her fresh-baked banana blueberry bread was divine. Would book again in an instant. Highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a 4 night weekend in Austin, staying at Cynthia & Jim's.   It went very well.  The room is exactly as pictured.  It's separate from the house, sharing a common screened-in back porch.  The bed is a queen futon, but quite comfortable.  We awoke to the sound of morning doves - very nice.

Cynthia had nice little touches - beverages and snacks, fresh-baked blueberry bread, coffee ready to brew in the morning, etc.  The room has it's own adjoining bathroom and kitchenette (sink, microwave, little fridge).  Cynthia left detailed notes on places to eat.  Wifi was great.  We never used the TV but it's there too.  Being dog folks we asked to meet the dogs and had a couple opportunities to pet them during our stay. 

This was our first visit to Austin.  We weren't sure about the location, being south of downtown.  (URL HIDDEN) so close to everything!   Downtown in six minutes, SOCO restaurants and clubs in 5 minutes, etc.  Perfect location for us.

Cynthia and Jim were friendly and unobtrusive.  We saw them less than once a day for pleasant interchanges.  

We would stay there again if we are back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This couldn't have been a nicer place, and a perfect location to boot! We were close to the trails, to the river, to downtown - but still had this cozy, friendly home to come back to each day after our adventures...

... the highlights?

...fresh coffee every morning...

...a lovely, soft bed...

...a pampering massage chair...

...a spinning bicycle for workouts...

...a quiet neighborhood with zero trains, airplanes or loud cars...

...and a very friendly and amicable host!

We would go back to this Airbnb in a heartbeat. Loved it!"
,,,,,,,,Our first airbnb experience was excellent thanks to Cynthia and Jim.  Loved the stocked frig upon our very late arrival!  Sipping fresh coffee and eating banana nut bread out in the screened porch in the morning was great too.  Very comfortable bed and large bathroom.  Really appreciated all the amenities (your list of things to see and do was so helpful) and we loved your dogs too!  We definitely want to visit Austin again and hope to see you then!
,,,,,,,,"WHAT A WONDERFUL PLACE! 

Hosts: There are not enough great things to say about Cynthia and her husband. They are incredibly welcoming and sweet people. They also had a list of suggested things to do in Austin which was great! They were accessible and accommodating. We loved getting to know them! 

Accommodation: Clean, quiet, comfortable, and private. The fact that we had access to the patio was an added treat. We had coffee and banana bread ready for us every morning and not to mention we hung out with their two adorable dogs. But if you're not a dog person, don't worry because I invited them to hang out with us, otherwise they spend most of their time in the house. 

Location: Excellent location! We were able to walk to Barton Springs, Downtown, South Congress, South Lamar. There is also a Mexican Restaurant down the street if you want an afternoon margarita.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Looking forward to returning to Austin and there is no question that this is where we will stay.  "
,,,,,,,,"We very much enjoyed our first airbnb experience at the Cozy SOCO.  Cynthia and Jim were a wealth of information on the activities of Austin. Their recommendations were very helpful, as this was our first visit to Austin. It was a nice touch to be greeted with a welcome basket and filled fridge, and we particularly appreciated the soft, luxurious, SCENT FREE bedding.  The location was perfect for walking along the water, shopping, and restaurants."
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Cynthia and Jim's place during SXSW and it was an oasis of calm and relaxation amidst the chaos of the festival! Their place is lovely and comfortable and they are the nicest, most thoughtful hosts anyone could hope for. There are lots of things to see/do/eat within the immediate neighborhood, and they are a skip away from downtown. I cannot imagine a better stay for any visitor to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This was a home away from home. I stayed here during SXSW and it was a wonderful, relaxing, calm place to retire to after a busy day of overwhelming chaos. Cynthia and Jim could not have been nicer or more welcoming. From the help planning my trip, to the friendly advice about the city and conference, to the coffee and pumpkin bread each morning - this was an ideal place to stay. I would absolutely go back. My only regret is that I didn't have a chance to get to know Cynthia and Jim better."
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved staying at this very cozy and private apartment. We were provided everything we needed and more! Cynthia and her husband were very attentive with us. If ever back in Austin, I will definitely book with Cynthia again, if available. Thanks again for everything! :) "
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim's place was PERFECT. They have thought of everything, and I mean everything. We were as comfortable as we are at home. The studio is just beautiful, and the bed is comfortable. Having a mini-fridge and microwave was excellent as well. 
The location is fantastic. We walked the whole of Austin right from the house. It was so nice to stay somewhere and not need a car. The neighborhood is so nice as well with lots of adorable houses to admire. There are a bunch of great bars and restaurants very nearby. 
I have to say though that the best part of our stay was Cynthia and Jim. They were so friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed talking with them so much. They seemed to have a genuine interest in us having a great visit to Austin. 
We plan to stay again!"
,,,,,,,,Great location!  Short walking distance to good food (El Alma and Green Misquite).  Short bike ride to Zilker Park.  Short drive to 6th Street.  The apartment has everything you need plus a little more.  I would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Everything about this place is wonderful.  We arrived after a long day of travelling to a beautiful picturesque house in an awesome neighbourhood.  Hosts had a nice welcome letter and helpful local information waiting for us.  The bedroom was lovely with a comfortable bed and an incredible massage chair that melted hours of airport stress away.  Had dinner at a great mexican restaurant on the corner and checked out the downtown core (a short walk away).  Next day, we woke up to sunlight streaming through the tall high ceiling windows and fresh baked blueberry banana bread on the porch.  Could not have been a better start to the day.

All in all, we were in Austin for almost a week and thoroughly enjoyed staying here.  Right across the river from the downtown core, around the corner from the performing arts center, a 20 minute walk from the convention center, and surrounded in every direction by great restaurants and bars.  Also in the immediate area was a nature trail, bike rental shop, mini putt place, and a nice little par 3 golf course ($8 for a round).

All the good things I've ever heard about Austin were embodied in this place.  Definitely a combination of super cool hosts and a gorgeous property in one of the city's best neighbourhoods. This was only our 2nd stay at an airbnb but it was so good, I swear I am never staying at a hotel ever again.  In fact, I think that if all airbnbs were as great as Cynthia and Jim's place, the hotel industry would completely collapse.  In fact, Cynthia and Jim should start a hotel network of places designed like their home.  They would be billionaires, I'm telling you.  

Anyways, A+++, 10/10, Five Stars, don't bother with other listings, this is the place you've been looking for. Seriously just do it."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim's place is absolutely lovely. Easily the best airbnb stay I've had (and I've stayed at airbnb places in four countries over multiple years.) Cynthia and Jim are lovely people, and they made my girlfriend and I truly feel at home. From the homemade blueberry bread to the bottled water in the fridge to the fantastic local recommendations, Cynthia and Jim couldn't have been more accommodating. If we make it back to Austin, we'll surely look to stay at this spot again. Thanks, Cynthia and Jim!"
,,,,,,,,Cynthia and Jim have a great place in a location that's perfect to explore Austin.  The room was comfortable and cozy and it was perfect to start each day with Cynthia's delicious blueberry banana bread. Cynthia and Jim were full of recommendations for things to do in Austin.  We'd definitely go back the next time we're in town.  
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were the perfect hosts.  My fiance and I arrived to the apartment in the wee hours of the morning due to some travel delays and we were greeted by some delicious fresh baked blueberry banana bread that made our travel delays melt away.  The apartment was stocked with a variety of other great snack items (including a couple of cold beers), magazines about Austin, and a great list of things to do in Austin, which we referenced heavily throughout the weekend.  The apartment was private and perfect for us.  Great location, fun and polite dogs to interact with occasionally when coming and going, and nice conversation when we had the forture to encounter Jim and Cynthia in their own day-to-day.  We had a great time in Austin and want to return soon - I hope we can stay here every time!"
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I absolutely loved staying at Cynthia's place in Austin. First, Cynthia is an outstanding host. Fantastic recommendations on things to do and places to eat but so many nice personal touches - coffee and baked treats on the porch and cold drinks in the fridge. So many nice extras.

The accommodations were simple and perfectly located for a great visit to Austin. The river trails and great places to eat/drink are walking distance. If you enjoy jogging/running, the scene is phenomenal. I ran every morning along the river starting from the front gate of Cynthia's place.

We look forward to keeping in touch with Cynthia and look forward to seeing her again in Austin!
"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were excellent hosts. Accommodations were quaint, location is fantastic, an easy walk to downtown, South Congress, or local parks. Cynthia made us some delicious banana bread, and coffee, bottled water, and yogurt were provided as well. They were happy to provide recommendations for local restaurants and events as well. Fantastic first experience with airbnb."
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay at Cynthia and Jim's place! We really enjoyed the fresh baked bread and the coffee in the morning. Would certainly recommend the place to others. 
,,,,,,,,"We were visiting Austin to go to a friend's wedding and we couldn't have chosen a better place to stay for that week. 

Cynthia and Jim are the most awesome hosts you could possibly hope for. Full of advice, kind and welcome they made the whole trip worth it just with their presence! 

The accommodation is kooky and fun! A lovely room as described in the listing which is more than enough for two people. 

I really have to say that they were amazing, we had fresh coffee every morning and even some delicious baked banana bread! What more can you possibly ask for! 

All in all, 5 out of 5! 

We should mention that we fell in love with their dogs too! Che and Tango are absolutely adorable too!

Of course, the location is also spot on and the neighbourhood is awesome. 

If you need a place to stay in Austin, this is it."
,,,,,,,,"My stay with Cynthia and Jim was amazing! Such a cute and comfortable space. There was fresh coffee every morning, a filled fridge, all the bathroom necessities and Cynthia even made fresh banana bread! 
Both Cynthia and Jim were full of great recommendations for local restaurants, etc. and their house is in a great location that makes it easy to access everything around.
We got to spend time and get to know our hosts and spend a wonderful evening going out to dinner and chatting on the beautiful screening in porch. 
All together it was really just amazing! I can't wait to go back!

"
,,,,,,,,"We had the most perfect weekend at Cynthia and Jim's guest cottage. It was comfortable, cozy, and had tons of stuff for guests - from bathroom amenities to banana bread and coffee (which was delicious!). They organized a list of things to do in Austin, along with information about their historic neighborhood. We took Cynthia's advice and went to an art event in east Austin, and it was wonderful. 

Overall, it was simply lovely! One of my best Airbnb experiences yet, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a non-touristy Austin experience."
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay! Cynthia and Jim were perfect hosts and the apartment was perfect - comfortable and in a great location. We would stay again without hesitation. 
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I visited Austin in order to attend the Fun Fun Fun music festival.  We added a day at Cynthia's place at the last minute without problems due to a flight booking mistake - oops!  Cynthia and her husband (and the dogs) were ultra friendly, accommodating hosts, left us pumpkin bread, and had a mini fridge stocked with water, a couple beers, OJ, and yogurt, not to mention the granola bars and fabulous chocolate bar left out for us.  To me the ultimate treat was just having to wake up in the morning, head to the screen porch, and simply press ""on"" to have a pot of coffee ready to go within a few minutes.  This was true hospitality.  The bed and room in general was very comfortable, plenty of room for us.  The location is great too, easy to catch a bus to downtown, though we walked, since it wasn't far.  We were also about a 5 minute walk from Auditorium Shores, where the music festival was held.  Overall I definitely recommend!! "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience â€” and it was fantastic. It was so nice to stay someplace that felt like home while on vacation. Cynthia and Jim's place was so comfortable and inviting that it took no time at all to get settled and set off into our plans. The pups are very sweet and Brendan was so helpful (and made us some very awesome quick bread to enjoy on the porch). Our time went so smoothly, thanks in large part to our location. It was easy to walk almost anywhere or at least find a nearby bus stop. 

Thanks again to Cynthia, Jim and Brendan! We had a blast."
,,,,,,,," We really enjoyed our stay in this studio in SoCo near Town Lake and Austin's great urban parks and walking/biking trails.   We loved being able to walk to downtown, Zilker Park and South Congress neighborhoods.  Cynthia and Jim were great hosts- the room is very comfortable and the porch with fresh coffee and pumpkin bread was a great space to spend the early morning. Don't miss El Alma restaurant across the street with their lovely patio.   All in all a great location and wonderful hosts."
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay.  The location is about a block from Barton Springs Road, so everything I am interested in is walking distance.  The room was very nice and clean, and Cynthia left a welcome basket of snacks, muffins, and a small frig stocked with beverages.  I will stay there again (unless I buy the house next door which was for sale when I was there).  Thank you Cyntha!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were the best hosts! Our room was comfortable, adorable, and the location was extremely convenient... we didn't rent a car, and we were never left wishing we had! We really truly felt at home thanks to Cynthia and Jim's hospitality--they accommodated us with an early check-in, provided fresh coffee and pumpkin bread in the mornings and authentic 'Austin' recommendations. We had everything we needed and more. I would recommend this stay to anyone! My boyfriend and I hadn't even left Austin yet before we were talking about staying here the next time we're in town. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay with Cynthia and Jim! The guest quarters was very comfortable and we loved the screened in porch, which had a view of their beautifully landscaped yard. The fridge was stocked and there was a goody basket with lots of yummy stuff. The pumpkin bread was to die for and we loved enjoying it with the delicious coffee. The place was very clean and the massage chair was great after our walks too and from the ACL festival. We were within a mile of Zilker park, which was great because we could walk too and from our festival! (Others were paying 20$ just to park where we were staying). We loved our stay and would recommend Cynthia and the SOCO stay to anyone! Thanks! "
,,,,,,,,The room and location can't be beat! We'd have had a great time staying here even if Cynthia hadn't exceeded all expectations and obligations and even if it hadn't been for the delicious blueberry bread! We hope to be back!
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was a fantastic host, and I could not have asked for better accommodations! Not only was she helpful with information about Austin, she checked in with me the day before arrival to make sure I knew how to get in. The room itself was very comfortable- great bed, roomy bathroom, free Wi-Fi, and the massage chair was to die for! And, to top it all off, the mini-fridge was stocked with drinks & yogurt, and there was fresh blueberry bread and coffee ready to go in the morning! And all for an $8 cab fare to the Convention Center! My colleagues who stayed at the Best Western were so jealous! Thank you, Cynthia!!"
,,,,,,,,"Awesome, high ceiling space in a fantastic location. Cynthia was very kind and accommodating. Comfortable and convenient; what more can you ask for."
,,,,,,,,"We loved this very cute place in Austin. Cynthia and Jim were hospitable hosts and were also very helpful in recommending places to check out. They left us coffee, homemade blueberry banana bread which was amazing, along with fruits, snacks, and other goodies (and a whole fridge of drinks to choose from. The screened in porch was especially nice. Apartment is located close to all the action within walking/biking/short driving distances
We really enjoyed our stay with them and would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I recently had the pleasure of staying in Cynthia and Jim's guest apartment for nearly a full month. It's a clean, comfortable and quiet place, and is in an ideal location - convenient to both downtown Austin and to South Congress, but not right on top of either. Cynthia certainly knows how to make her guests feel welcome - on several occasions I found freshly-baked goodies waiting for me in the morning, and she went out of her way to tell
me about happenings in the area that I might be interested in. I'd
definitely stay here again - in fact, the next time I'm in Austin, this is the first listing I'll check.
-Spencer Fleury"
,,,,,,,,"We loved this very cute place in Austin. Cynthia and Jim were very nice and left us coffee, strawberries and blueberry bread.  They were also very helpful in recommending places and music to check out.  The screened in porch was especially nice after the rain cooled things down a bit!  We really enjoyed our stay with them and would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Austin.  Great location! "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful location for the fun things to do in downtown and South Congress area. Room was very comfortable and cool and cozy feeling. Massage chair a fun extra. Yummy blueberry banana bread and very good coffee.
,,,,,,,,"As a lone traveller, visiting Austin for the first time, this was a great place to stay. Cynthia was very helpful before my visit and provided me with lots of excellent suggestions for places to visit. As a result, I had a lovely weekend. The apartment is very comfortable and I enjoyed breakfasting on banana bread and coffee in the veranda. I didn't have a car, but the location of the flat made it easy to explore the city on foot and via the bus. I would happily return."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and her son were hospitable hosts!  She left us homemade blueberry banana bread which was amazing, along with fruits, snacks, and other goodies (and a whole fridge of drinks to choose from)!  They were so flexible on check-in-check-out time it made our stay stressfree.   Location location location! If you want the best location for your stay in Austin close to all the action within walking/biking/short driving distances, this is the place to be!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and her husband Jim were amazing hosts even before we arrive. They helped coordinate my travel plans and stored some of our things before we even arrived. When we arrived the place was amazing!!! They had a stocked fridge, a welcome note and  little goodies. Honestly it was more like a bnb than any of the other places. They gave me complete privacy and every once in a while would offer up a cold beer or a very tasty margarita. 
Both Jim and Cynthia were extremely nice and the room was great. Great shower, big bathroom, cozy bed, good circulation. And great great location !!! You an really get any where from there house in no time :) I would highly recommend their house and I look forward to staying there again if I visit Austin in the future :)"
,,,,,,,,"I have to say, Cynthia is the ""hostess with the mostest""! The place was very charming, and within easy walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go. The extras made our trip to Austin so much more enjoyable. Nicely stocked fridge, fresh fruit and homemade breads and muffins in the morning, comfortable bedding, soft towels... It couldn't have been nicer. We'll definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia, Jim and the pups were wonderful hosts! We even woke up our first morning to homemade blueberry, banana bread that was delicious! The location was perfect and the space was exactly what we needed. I definitely recommend checking them out when you're planning a trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time staying here for a wedding. This will definitely be our go-to place to stay for any subsequent trips to Austin. Cynthia and her husband Jim (and their two awesome dogs) were both super friendly, welcoming, and respectful of our privacy. Although attached to the main house, the room(s) still felt secluded and private. The bed (actually a futon), turned out to be insanely comfortable. There were also a few welcoming baskets, some cold beer and water in the fridge, and delicious home-made pumpkin bread + fresh-brewed coffee left out for us in the morning. There is even an awesome massage chair that will try to assimilate you into the Skynet/Borg if you're not careful. A superb experience all-around!"
,,,,,,,,"I was in town for work with Whole Foods Market and a conference at UT Austin. Cynthia and Jim were great hosts and very accommodating of my travel and work schedules. The studio was full of really nice touches like shampoo/soap and a basket of teas, which came in handy when my luggage was lost...Their place was in a really convenient location and had a great local Austin funkiness to it. I had a great stay and would highly recommend to other travelers!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were exceptionally nice, friendly, and welcoming hosts who went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. Their house is close to downtown Austin with easy street parking, and a large, pretty riverside park nearby. The apartment is large, clean, and comfortable with some nice extras like a leather recliner and massage chair. The bathroom is also nice, and they have a small apartment-sized fridge in there. When I was leaving, I was having trouble finding a cab, and Cynthia actually ended up offering to drive me to the airport. Couldn't ask for a nicer place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia and Jim were fantastic hosts!  Comfortable home, great dogs, and coffee and bagels when we woke.  Cheers!"
,,,,,,,,"Cynthia was incredibly hospitable in all the right ways. Great conversation, great recommendations, great welcoming treats and etc. Location could not be better and the room was quiet, peaceful and comfortable. I hope we get to stay there again. "
1080704,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great location and clean, safe surroundings. Comfy bed to boot!"
,,,,,,,,Kristen was an excellent host. Communication was easy and the place was perfect. We would love to stay again. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to stay close to downtown or UT.
,,,,,,,,Enjoyed it!
,,,,,,,,Kristen is a great host. Instructions for check in were easy to follow and the location has great access to the city attractions if you don't mind a bit of walking.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was wonderful.  Located in downtown Austin, her apartment offers a central and walkable location to explore Austin.  Clean facility with a very comfortable bed.  Great Wifi and even free laundry on the 2nd floor.  Thanks Kristen"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is perfectly serviceable, if a little odd. The bed is tucked away in a little alcove at the back of the apartment -- you can't enter from the side, but instead have to crawl up from the foot of the bed. The bathroom is tiny, and the shower is very confusing: it's totally unclear how to make the water come out of the showerhead instead of the faucet, and if not for a helpful note from a previous Airbnb guest, I would not have figured it out. The apartment was clean, but the towels were a bit smelly.

There was no hot water in the apartment on the first night of my reservation, and while Kristen was very communicative about her efforts to resolve the issue, she wasn't willing to provide any money back on my reservation.

The apartment is near a few fast food restaurants, but it's hard to find good food nearby. There isn't a grocery store within walking distance, either."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect, basic accommodations if you're looking for a place to crash in Austin. We felt safe, had everything we needed and the other tenants in the building were friendly to us. We unfortunately didn't have hot water during our last day but that's out of the control of the host and in the hands of property management. She was super responsive though when we notified her of the issue. If you're a super clean freak...The place was by most standards clean, but noticeably lived in (fingerprints and watermarks on the fridge, dust, etc.) and just not pristinely clean like most other airbnb's I've stay in. Not a deal breaker at all (and I'm a clean freak) but something I definitely noticed."
,,,,,,,,Kristen's home was clean and comfortable. Very convenient to downtown and UT. Great water pressure in shower. Covered parking space. We were very pleased!
,,,,,,,,Best AIRBNB in Austin. Great location. Great apartment. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
,,,,,,,,Kristen's home was very nice and had everything we could have asked for. The check in process was very convenient and the parking was easily accessible. We would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"If you are looking to experience Austin, this is the best location you could find! Traffic was calm outside all day and night and we walked the entire length of the city with ease... pick this spot! We would love to return! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's apartment was outstanding! Clean, cozy and, centrally located to eats/sights.

The University of Texas, State Capital, and 6th Street are all accessible on foot.

Arturo's is an excellent breakfast option and Gourdough's Public House has great mixed drinks and doughnuts. Highly recommend both establishments.

The apartment is also a comfortable walk to Franklin BBQ. Be aware they close at 3:30pm and may sell out up to an hour prior to closing. Brisket was well worth the wait!

Would certainly stay again if travels take us back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This place was cozy, welcoming, and incredibly convenient! We were able to walk just about everywhere, including a few short blocks to the wedding we were in town for at the hotel Ella! The place was clean, the owner was communicative, and there was coffee. Not much more you could ask for :)"
,,,,,,,,Great experience. Convenient location. Very comfortable. Flexible and gracious host. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic place, just enough for a couple and their small dog. It's just a few blocks away from UT and also a bus stop which can bring you to other main drags. Also a short cab ride from the nightlife 6th Street. The bed was incredibly comfortable. I would love to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Exactly as advertised! We were able to walk to the Capitol and a variety of good spots for food. The parking spot was super handy as we drove out for a few things. Bed was great. Good size for two people. Would stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,Great place! Great location! Great host! Easy access to everything. I would recommend this place to anyone or any couple who is coming to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Great stay in Austin! Right downtown, close to everything! We were really able to explore the city!"
,,,,,,,,"Host was amazing, worked with us throughout the process, even went above and beyond to make sure we got where we wanted to go after arrival.  Phenomenal all around experience!!!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was in a great location, safe neighborhood, and conveniently by a bus stop (which is very easy to navigate via the app and inexpensive, ~$3 for unlimited rides for 24 hours). It is just a few blocks away from the UT campus and just a 15 minute walk downtown to local bars & restaurants. Apartment was clean and spacious for two people. Kristen was readily available and answered all of our questions. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's condo was exactly as depicted in her ad! Quaint and cute - the perfect amount of amenities needed for our short weekend stay. Roughly a 5 minute walk to the state capitol, which was excellent. Really felt like it was in a safe easy neighborhood to be in. Air conditioning worked well. Shower had good hot water. Bed was comfortable. Couch was comfortable. Wifi connected quickly and worked well also. Kristen was very accommodating - we were looking to borrow a few fold up chairs to avoid flying with them for the weekend, and she made it a point to locate a few and bring them over for us. Thanks for that, Kristen! Overall a great first experience with using AirBNB! Will definitely consider if we come back to Austin anytime soon! :)"
,,,,,,,,Kristen's place was the perfect place to stay the night in Austin! Easy access to downtown and was clean and very comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,"Tree lined street. No cooking equipment, it's a studio apartment not a condo. Three flights of stairs and the. Neighbors seemed annoyed we were ""AirBnb'ers""
Overall it was not worth 100+ a night but consider the option for that week I can't complain. All these people putting 5 star reviews should read the criteria for a 5 star accommodation before posting. I used these reviews as a deciding factor and it was not as listed."
,,,,,,,,"The condo was wonderful and conveniently located to many of the attractions that we wanted to see. The neighborhood was pedestrian-friendly, so we were able to walk to a fair amount of places we wanted to see (the Capitol, State History Museum, graffiti park, DKR Stadium). If something wasn't within walking distance, it was a 5-10 minute drive via Ride Austin. The condo is also in a quiet neighborhood, so we didn't have to deal with any noise from the bars like you would if you were located in a different part of town. Kristen's place was well-kept, cozy, clean, and welcoming. I really appreciated her whiteboard message and the handwritten guides to Austin, which we used a lot to find things to do and places to see. "
,,,,,,,,"This pleasantly shaded condominium is convenient to both the Capitol building in downtown Austin and the UT campus. On a nice day, a person could easily walk to both locations. The hostess, Kristen, is helpful and accessible. We had questions about getting into the property when we arrived, and even though Kristen was on her way to Dublin, at the time of our arrival, she answered our calls and was very gracious. Also, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that the bed in this apartment is unusually comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect. Couldn't beat the downtown location
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood was great and right in the city of austin! Off street parking was amazing. The description was very accurate!
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was just as listed. Quiet, clean, and within walking distance of great restaurants and bars. "
,,,,,,,,Everything was super simple and super smooth.  She also included a handy guide for activities/attractions in the neighborhood!  I would definitely recommend this studio if you need to visit Austin. It was a short walk or taxi to anything.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's apartment looked just like the photos. The bed was super-comfortable. She provided a detailed description of the special mattress on the bed which was made without chemicals. I had never heard of this before, but I very much appreciated its comfort and slept very well there. I loved the neighborhood. It was tree-lined and quiet yet close to UT and also a short walk to Starbucks. I had my little dog with me and it was very pet-friendly. Kristen's communication was clear and she responded almost immediately to my messages."
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, as described. Great access to university. "
,,,,,,,,"To start, Kristi was a great host! Even though there were a few hiccups before/during our stay in her condo, once we were at the place, we found everything satisfactory and as described. The location is great and quiet, even though the college is not too far. We also appreciated the parking spot under the building, a nice addition for Austin. Overall we would recommend staying here and looking forward to coming back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Kristen was really easy to communicate with and getting into the place was so easy. I think the host is just as important as the place is and both were great! 
,,,,,,,,The location is great for both exploring the downtown scenes and the University of Texas.  It is very walkable with plenty of necessities nearby.  The place looks just as it is in the pictures.  It was quiet as well.  Great choice for getting away in Austin.    
,,,,,,,,"Nice, cozy apartment within walking distance of great bars and restaurants.  Kristen responded to each request quickly.  Highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristi's place is right in the heart of Austin, within walking distance of The Drag and UT. Great location! Comfortable accommodations too. It is 2 flights up stairs though, so be aware if you have bad knees or lots of luggage! Pictures show it well - loved the private dressing area by the bathroom - very useful! "
,,,,,,,,Good location. Just out of down town enough to be in a tree lined street. Close to public transport. House was clean and wifi had an excellent connection. 
,,,,,,,,"Great experience staying at Kristen's place!  The location was perfect - it was very easy to get around using public transportation (we did not have a car).  The place was very cute, the perfect amount of space for 2 people!"
,,,,,,,,"We were looking for a place in Austin for the night kind of last minute, we found this condo and Kristen got back to me immediately and booked us! The location of the condo was great and we slept 3 comfortably and had everything we needed for the night. This condo is sweet and simple, which was all we needed! Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great time in Austin, Kristen's place was perfect and exactly as described! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in Austin, the condo was great! Exactly as described. We were provided with good tips on where to go by Kristen when we arrived. Access was super simple and we hope to come back someday soon."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was super accommodating from the get go and made our trip super easy! Check in and check out is easy and convenient and we loved the quiet neighborhood the apartment is located in. It is a bit of a walk from downtown Austin, but is just a short drive/cab ride away if you want to save some time and footwork :) Also, if you do plan to walk, you are able to walk past the capitol which is lovely and scenic on your way to downtown. I loved that we had access to their washer and dryer as I could wash clothes before we left to the second half of our trip. Loved our stay, thanks Kristen!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was great â€” easy to deal with Kristen, nice location, comfortable place. I would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment is in a great location and has a great lived-in vibe with personality you won't get at a cold impersonal hotel. There is a great hand written personal guide to Austin we used to find some great local spots. Hostess was responsive and provided us with everything we needed for a great stay.
,,,,,,,,Lovely apartment that felt like home! Very clean and Kristen was super nice! Close to everything we wanted to see. Thanks Kristen! 
,,,,,,,,"Everything pictured was very accurate, easy access, very comfy bed, very nice neighborhood and very quiet. Nice covered reserved parking spot.  We really only slept there at night and was busy all day but we did take a couple of walks with our dog. Great location to everything. I would recommend this place to my friends and family."
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful little getaway! Even with a possible little hiccup at that beginning, something completely out of the hosts control, she communicated well and had a back up plan (even though we didn't need to use it). It helped us stay stress free and enjoy our vacation. The place was clean and quickly felt like a home. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment itself was great - it's small but clean and neat. The location is excellent. We went to a concert at the Frank Erwin center and were able to walk. Also, Clay Pit is super close and AMAZING if you like Indian food. 

The only problem was that the apartment was HOT...when we got there, it was 84 degrees. We turned on the air and left for dinner and the concert, hoping it would cool by the time we returned. When we got back many hours later, it was still 84 degrees. I tried to reach Kristen, but it was 1am so I'm sure she was asleep. In the morning, I saw she had texted and said she had just had the AC fixed. She offered to refund half the cost of our stay. Come to find out, it was a setting on the AC that caused it to not allow the temperature to drop any lower. 

Kristen did refund a little less than half the cost of our stay, so I was thankful for that. I wish we had known about the AC, as I think our stay would have been much more enjoyable if it had been cooler in the apartment! 

One last thing, be sure to bring all your own food, water bottles, etc. There is a full kitchen but it is sparse. It has been my experience that Airbnb hosts usually provide some type of light food/beverages. I know that's probably not a requirement but it does make the stay a lot nicer when a few things are provided. Just an FYI to those of you who may be expecting more. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a great host!

Check in: She sent check in information about a week before our stay and it was explained well and easy to understand. I contacted Kristen to see if we could get an early check in and she was very accommodating.

Apartment: Parking spaces were a nice plus! The apartment was clean and spacious, the bed was very comfortable and there was working ac which helped with how hot it was! The building was quiet (we never saw/heard any other residents).

Location: it's about a $10 uber/lyft to Rainey street and even less to 6th street. Easy to get around but not a loud/rowdy area.

Overall: would definitely recommend!


"
,,,,,,,,Cozy & comfortable apartment in a great location! Perfect for a short visit to Austin with everything you need to feel at home!
,,,,,,,,"As a first timer on this service and with the goal of staying at a place with a short walk to the University, Kristen's place is perfect.  Great communication with directions to the location, where to park, and how to get in; and a quick response when questions are asked. Well done. I will be coming back."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was awesome. She was very communicative and accommodating to our needs. Her place was clean, homey and exactly what we needed for a great stay in Austin. I am an avid traveler and I can't say enough about this place. Would definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,Kristen was very attentive and gave me a heads up when the place was ready. I arrived at a clean unit ready for my stay. There was also some helpful details on the coffee table that gave me a lay of the neighborhood.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was exactly as described & in the photos. Large apartment in a quiet block just outside of the city centre. We had no problem checking in, the instructions were very clear. The washing machine & dryers look very new & were easy to use. We would recommend this place to others! Thanks so much "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's condo was a great home base for our trip to Austin! I was in town for a wedding, and it was close to many of the events, and a manageable walk from the 6th street bars and restaurants. Getting in to the apartment was a breeze, and Kristen was available to answer any questions we had. "
,,,,,,,,Very clean and also a great spot in the middle of the city will recommend!
,,,,,,,,The apt was just as described and just what we needed. The list of recommended restaurants was great. Very glad for the free parking spot. Would recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Great experience!  Stayed here with wife and small daughter for UT graduation.  Location was perfect...easily within walking distance to UT, Capital and good restaurants.  Condo was updated and clean.  Kristen was very responsive and made our stay and effortless one.  Highly recommended!    "
,,,,,,,,"Very pleasant stay, and Kristen was a super considerate host. Would happily stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Very nice stay
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great rate, very pleased!"
,,,,,,,,Positive experience! Loved the hospitality and ambiance. Definitely would recommend to my friends and stay again.
,,,,,,,,"I would definitely recommend Kristen's place! She was very communicative before we arrived with everything we needed to know and was easily reached by text if we had any questions. She provided a great welcome guide with tips and things to do in Austin and the apartment was well located with parking! The apartment itself was cute, clean, and had everything we needed. Overall, we had a great stay and I wouldn't hesitate to book Kristen's place again if we went back. "
,,,,,,,,Kristen's condo was great-quiet and located in the heart of downtown Austin.  Check in was easy and communication was clear.  Recommend!
,,,,,,,,"The condo was overall great. Accurate, comfortable, and clean. I had a chance to meet Kristen, she was very nice and made sure I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay.  "
,,,,,,,,The place was clean and easy to find. The instructions I was given made it simple to find the listing and get some much needed rest.
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Kristen's condo for just one night. She is a really thoughtful host - there are little helpful signs for the wifi, how to use the shower, etc. I never felt at a loss -- it was easy to jump right in! It was nice that the toilet/shower are separate from the sink, so I could still do my hair and makeup while my boyfriend showered. The location is AWESOME: we walked to tons of great restaurants! Check-in and check-out instructions were easy and thorough, and Kristen responded to all of our messages quickly :)"
,,,,,,,,"We had a fantastic stay at Kristen's condo. It was exactly as described and depicted in the pictures, in a quiet neighborhood a stones throw from the capitol and within walking distance of all the fun stuff downtown. Kristen made sure we had all the info we needed before we arrived and was always quick to respond to messages. We would definitely stay in her condo again. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is lovely. It's clean, quiet, and has everything you might need. The mattress is very comfortable-- something I very much appreciated after a 12 hour drive. Kristen is an excellent host and made us feel very welcome. Definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was very easy to get in touch with, and responsive throughout the process.  Everything about the place was as described.  Very clean and organized apartment.  Location was convenient to points of interest, but also a bit tucked away from some of the busier areas of town which was nice in the evenings.  It didn't get that warm when we visited, but I am sure the central a/c would be heavenly in the hotter months.  "
,,,,,,,,Stayed at Kristen's apartment to check out SXSW with a couple friends and I don't think it could have been any smoother or more comfortable. Her place is situated close enough to all the action but tucked away quite nicely so it's not busy/loud. She has covered parking which is awesome. Her place is on the third floor with no elevator -- which is not a big deal but something worth mentioning. Kristen was super prompt and clear with her directions. No complaints and would definitely stay here again if available. 
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a perfect host. Entry was super-easy, and she had laid out snacks (tortilla chips, cookies), stocked the fridge with beer and sparkling water, and left clear and easy to follow instructions. The space was big, the bed comfortable and the amenities excellent. Would definitely go back. "
,,,,,,,,"The condo was clean, comfortable, and well maintained. Parking was safe and off street. Condo located on a quiet street but walkable to the main blocks of restaurants/bars. Would absolutely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful condo, in a great neighborhood; clean, comfy, and perfectly suited to my needs. The internet was quite patchy during my stay; Time Warner Cable is never reliable, but I was relying on it for work-related things and it kept disconnecting and reconnecting. But this was a really lovely place: thanks Kristen!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was very much as represented -- clean, quiet and convenient to downtown with all the features I needed. As a business traveler, I found it a good place from which to work when I needed and only a short Uber ride away from any neighborhood where I needed or wanted to be. Recommended. "
,,,,,,,,Kristen was a great host and very responsive. Condo was clean and a perfect place to retire after chasing my longhorn around all day! We will definitely request Kristen and her downtown Austin condo the next time we stay in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"The condo was clean, spacious and in a great location. This was our second time staying here and will continue to do so as Kristen makes it an accommodating stay."
,,,,,,,,Kristen was very helpful and flexible on arrival arrangements.  Place was as described and nice.  Good experience.
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was very nice, with comfortable bed, and nice layout. About a 10-15 minute walk to University of Texas and state capitol. Has a parking space, which was very helpful. Overall was very satisfied."
,,,,,,,,Kristen's apartment was conveniently located near the State Capitol Building downtown Austin.  The neighborhood was safe and there were some restaurants and stores in the area.  The room was spacious with a walk-in closet and the bed was very comfortable.  I highly recommend her place when you are planning to visit in Austin.  
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful place, excellent location, clean and spacious. Very accommodating and easy to communicate with. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was an excellent host.  The location was great.  It was located in a quiet neighborhood and took a $5.45 Uber ride five minutes to get downtown!  Everything was as she described it.   Great first experience with Airbnb.

,,,,,,,,I think this is my fourth time staying here. It was fantastic as always!
,,,,,,,,"Stayed here for one night, it was fantastic. Perfect little place, not too far from downtown, easy to walk to wherever. Apartment was super clean and we slept really well."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is perfect for seeing all of Austin. She left detailed instructions on how to check in and out, and the information on the city was a useful asset! Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience so I had some anxiety - needn't have worried! Very nice, clean, well-maintained, as advertised. Very quiet at night, wonderfully comfortable bed. Huge bathroom and kitchen, state of the art. Parking underneath building was easy and always available.  Although the access from the parking to the units was secured after hours, the parking itself is not. That said, I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe.  Kristen was prompt on my questions - there is a realtor-style lockbox on the front door to access key, so I didn't meet Kristen. Appreciated folder with local maps and extensive handwritten notes on Austin neighborhoods and restaurants.

Only con - if you have any difficulties with stairs, BEWARE: with parking on the first floor the condo is effectively on the third - NO ELEVATOR. Multiple flights of steep stairs made getting my luggage up and down very difficult and slow. On the plus side, each condo has a few chairs outside the doors so I just sat down to recover after every flight ;-)   If not for the stairs, I would be booking this place again."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was great! Very clean, easy access, and walking distance to some great spots (Freedman's BBQ was amazing!).

Would highly recommend staying here :)"
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay here. The apartment is clean, spacious, and located in the heart of downtown Austin. Getting in and out was very straightforward. I have no complaints--Kristen was responsive and an excellent host. I have used Airbnb extensively both as a host and a guest and this was as good as it gets. I highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,Great little apartment close to the UT campus. I would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was great. The place was perfectly located in Downtown and the condo was nice, clean, and just right. Would definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,Great ideas on things to do in Austin from the homeowner greeted us on the coffee table right as we walked in! This cozy apartment is perfect for 2 people and is on a quiet street not far from any of the action most out-of-towners would be looking for. Thank you for helping to make our stay in Austin great!
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was most generous and flexible. She provides very helpful information with regard to restaurants, sights, events etc. She knows her city!
Pleasant neighborhood in residential district, very quiet and safe.
Apartment clean and spacious."
,,,,,,,,"I was so tired from a 9-hour roadtrip. All I wanted was a convenient arrival and a comfortable bed. When I arrived, directions were very clear and everything was laid out perfectly and conveniently, and the bed couldn't have been more comfortable.

This apartment is the perfect size for a solo traveler or a couple. It's filled with modern appliances, and it's located perfectly to explore downtown and outer areas of Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great stay. Very cozy and near everything. 
,,,,,,,,"I really like this one clean, simple, quiet."
,,,,,,,,"It was a very nice condo in a perfect downtown location. It was exactly what we were looking for, I highly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,Loved my stay at Kristen's place.  Everything I needed and great communication from Kristen.  The location can't be beat.  Literally within walking distance of both the University and downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was an awesome place to stay with everything you could need as an Austin visitor. From the great location and easy check in to the really helpful local guide on where to eat and what to do, Kristen's place is great for business or personal travel. I would definitely recommend it and will likely stay again."
,,,,,,,,Easy instructions on how to get in. Super convenient! Good location and very clean. Thank you!!
,,,,,,,,"Great hostess, great location, covered parking, privacy gate, SUPER nice person to deal with. I've already booked her other property for next week."
,,,,,,,,The location of the apartment was ideal. Parking right under the building was convenient. The apartment has lots of natural sunlight. I would bring your own toiletries if you are planning to stay longer. 
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location and easy to access! It was perfect for our 2 day trip, we were mostly out and about and loved coming back to this comfortable condo!"
,,,,,,,,"Neighborhood was quiet. Did not interact with the host. The listing is accurate.

The location was great. Super convenient to get anywhere in town. Most things were less than a 15 minute drive away. If you don't have a car, I would recommend staying here when it's warm, because it is a decent (although not unacceptable) walk to a lot of the action. 

The bed was super comfortable! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a great host! She made the entire process very easy and always replied back quickly. Her place was clean, well-stocked, and in the perfect location. It was about a 10-15 minute drive anywhere we wanted to go. I appreciated the manual she left for us on the coffee table; and how she included things to do, places to see, and a little trivia about the property. Would definitely stay here again!  "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a very thoughtful host. Arrangements were super easy. Her place is a stone's throw from UT campus, but very quiet. Also easy walking distance to Capital and downtown."
,,,,,,,,Kristina was very good at responding to messages. The condo was in a great location and we made good use of the bus system to get around Austin. We knew in advance that the bed was in an alcove so that was fine. The area was quiet and felt safe. This was our first Airbnb but will not be our last. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo has a great location and is quiet, as advertised. It was clean. The decorating is basic and streamlined. There were some toiletries and food that others had left. There are basic supplies in the kitchen, nothing fancy. The bed was comfy. Kristen left a packet with local info. The wifi worked well and the climate control was easy to use!

I'd stay again if I wanted to be in this part of downtown."
,,,,,,,,"Great host, she was good at communicating and making sure any questions I had were answered. "
,,,,,,,,Neighborhood was nice. Very quiet.
,,,,,,,,It was a cute little studio type apartment. I wish I could have stayed longer. Felt very comfortable. It was a short uber ride to 6th St which was nice. Would definitely stay again :)
,,,,,,,,Kristen's place was great for Halloween weekend in Austin. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to anyone. The other reviews are spot on and have no complaints. 
,,,,,,,,Great place and location near UT campus. Attentive host and helpful tips for dining and entertainment. Bus or car needed for downtown destinations.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's condo was the ideal place to call home for my brief Austin getaway. Her check-in and neighborhood info was really helpful and the location was perfect for walking to campus and downtown. The bed was truly comfortable--I had an amazing nap the afternoon I arrived. There's a great variety of eateries in the area (I loved The Jalopy and Lavaca Teppan). The condo is located very close to the Megabus stop, so I was able to enjoy the city entirely on foot. I'll definitely stay here again the next time I head to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Lovely studio like experience. We enjoyed the sleeping arrangements as we felt like we were amongst the tree tops and were able to open the window.  Two flights of stairs with 'too heavy' luggage, the landings in between are excellent. Communication was very good.  Appreciate the fresh fruit and vegetables in the fridge, as well beer though we don't drink it.  "
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I stayed at Kristen's apartment for ACL, and she made our first time in Austin and our first time on AirBnB a great one!

,,,,,,,,The place was as described. Location was very good.
,,,,,,,,"Kristi did a great job of sending instructions for getting into the condo, and generally communicating throughout the experience. It's a great place - within easy walking distance of Guadalupe with access to UT, plenty of great places to eat, etc. It's about a mile north of 6th street, too, so not a bad walk there. Very enjoyable stay! I'll try to stay here again on future trips to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Awesome experience - host was tentative and open for questions or assistance if I needed anything.
,,,,,,,,"As advertised, convenient distance from many Austin hotspots. Very nice accommodation. An unmentioned plus: covered parking for hot Texan weekends!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 174 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,The places was exactly as described. Nice good sized apartment for my fiancÃ© and I. The air conditioning worked great which was a must in the Austin heat. The bed was very comfy. Check in was very easy and loved the proximity to things we wanted to see and do in the area.

Kristen was the perfect host. Most gracious. I would definitely stay here again!"

,,,,,,,,Nice and cozy place. The other reviews say it all. Highly recommended.

The apartment was well decorated and very clean and tidy
 The neighbourhood was lovely and quiet, but not too far away from anything. The listing was accurate and overall a great stay. If we ever return to Austin, we will definitely check this listing is free! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen made me feel welcome (she is also vey funny).  

Checking in was a breeze and everything was as described.  Will definitely go back and reccomend to others.

Top marks."
,,,,,,,,We had an awesome overnight stay in this great apartment in Austin. It is walking distance to great restaurants and bars. 
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was great! I have never used this application before, and attempted to use it last minute for a little getaway. Since, I am new to Airbnb I haven't really had reviews, nor set up a full profile. Still, Kristen let us in to her place, and thanks to her I was able to enjoy a wonderful Austin getaway! Her place was so cozy, and she even left us some great recommendations, and maps to get around! All and all, it was a great first time experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen is very responsive and the unit was very accommodating.

All her instructions were extremely detailed and finding the condo and getting the keys were extremely easy.   

The condo was in a very quiet neighborhood and was only a 10 minute walk to campus and 15 minute walk to downtown.  

I would stay here again next time we're in Austin!  "
,,,,,,,,Great stay excellent place to walk over tithe art conference center near UT. Good airco and really appreciated Kirsten's written tips about sightseeing & getting around.
,,,,,,,,"We really appreciated this little oasis in the hot-as-heck ATX heatwave.  It was cool, clean, and the shaded parking spot off the street is real nice.  Uber to where we wanted to go was under $5.  Would def stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was fantastic, location was great and it was neat and tidy. Kristen wasn't in town but was still very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. Would definitely stay here again the next time I am in Austin"

And it is a great location - pretty quiet neighborhood but very close to lots of stuff. Also, it was great to have an off-street parking space. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was quick in responding to our request and our stay, while short, was fantastic. About a 15 minute walk to 6th street if you have long legs like me. Kristen had a nice write up on the coffee table of all the cool places to go to as well. Last but not least was the amazing bed! If I ever find one like it, I would buy it in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,"Overal it was a nice place to stay with everything you would need, it's inbetween campus and downtown which is great for finding places to eat. "
,,,,,,,,"Had a wonderful time. I felt at home with a kitchen and everything I could possibly need to cook a nice meal - although I was way to lazy to do that. Instead I got comfy with a really soft robe and the best little throw...
I also like that it was close to everything but not so close that it was loud. I would love to stay at your place again. Thank you for taking me with such short notice."
,,,,,,,,"Lovely, new apartment within walking distance to the Capitol and beyond. Provided a much needed night of rest (and the most comfortable bed so far!) on our cross-country road trip. Kristen is a great communicator -- check-in instructions were crystal clear and everything was easy. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Kristen's was great. We just needed a quick one-night stay with our puppy. It was simple, clean, and a great price. Also in a great location close to UT, downtown, and restaurants. Kristen was really great with communication through texting. No complaints. We would recommend her place to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,Great location - we walked all over the Capitol and UT area.  The space was as described and suited our needs.

Kristen was always professional and prompt in replying to messages and answering our questions. We wish we could have stayed longer! "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was very clean and cozy. A very convinient location if you want to explore Austin. I had to call Kristen on day 1 to confirm something and she responds right away. The apartment had everything in it and I really liked how the host provided high quality toiletries and good coffee. The only thing to watch out for are the mosquitos hiding in the bushes near the front door. Remember the code to the door and dont linger around like i did. 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is very nice, and easy walking distance to UT and the AT&T Conference Center.  Kristen was very helpful and everything went smoothly."
,,,,,,,,Thanks for letting us stay at your place! Great location and the host was very available/easy to communicate with! Place was cozy/bathroom very nice! Good stay!

We would definitely stay again! Thank you!

Jon and Coleen "
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay at Kristen's condo. The location was great for getting to the UT campus and the downtown area and the surrounding area was quiet and peaceful. Parking was covered and off the street which was a plus.  The condo was just the right size for one or two people and was clean and neat with the exception of left over coffee grounds remaining in the coffee pot from a previous visitor. Not a huge issue. There was a maintenance problem with the air conditioner which meant we needed to be up and dressed a little earlier than we had planned to allow the AC repairman to come in. As it turned out, we were gone before he arrived. Otherwise, it did not affect our stay. Those things happen though and the timing is never good. It would have been nice to have scheduled it between our checkout time and the next person's check in time, but maybe that was not an option. Again, not a huge issue. We would stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great host! Was in contact immediately and gave a few recommendations before I arrived. After arriving, I found a great place, clean and welcoming.  There was a handwritten guide to local hotspots that would provide something for everyone. WOULD USE AGAIN!! Loved this comfy cozy place. "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience using Air b n b and I can say that it was awesome. The whole thing from start to finish was very professional from my initial contact to ask questions, to the instructions for a smooth and easy check in. The accommodation is in a fantastic quiet location just minutes from downtown. We walked to/from downtown Austin a number of times. The accommodation was extremely comfortable and presented very well. I could not have got as good accommodation at a Hotel in as a great location as this without spending a small fortune. Highly recommended to all. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristin is a gracious and professional host; the condo was exactly as it's described, and we enjoyed the clean and comfortable space.  The parking (underneath the building) is quite nice: we arrived just in time to stay dry from a thunderstorm.  The neighborhood is quiet and clean, and the condo is in very easy walking distance (under five minutes) to Arturo's, an excellent brunch spot.  We'd stay at Kristin's place again for sure. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristi is a great host that makes sure you have the Austin experience you are looking for by laying out detailed notes of all the things to do, varying by your level of interest. 

The house was spacious, clean, and not too far from all the main things to do. I'd definitely stay here again if I were to come back to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was super responsive and easy to communicate with.  The condo was in a great, quiet location and walkable or a $5 UBER ride to anywhere we wanted to go.  The condo was very functional with everything we needed.  I would definitely stay again when in the area.  The guide was super helpful make sure you take a look!  

"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is awesome! Very centrally located and clean. Coming from a cooler climate, I was really glad that the air conditioning worked so well. I'd stay again and would recommend to friends. "
,,,,,,,,Nice place - convenient for my quick stay - host left all instructions and there was no hassle 
,,,,,,,,Apartment was clean and in a nice area of town. Kristen was very responsive. Would definitely book again. 
,,,,,,,,Place was great!  Didn't ever have to contact Kristen while I was there because everything was covered before my arrival from her messages.  Easy walk to get breakfast on the way to UT campus!
,,,,,,,,"The listing was exactly as it looked in person. It's in a great little neighborhood and I appreciated how quiet it. We had no problems getting into the condo with Kristen's detailed e-mails. The list of places to eat and do she wrote out was helpful. I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a quiet, little condo to stay. Thanks Kristen!"
,,,,,,,,Nice little place near campus. Was really easy to access and everything was taken care of before my arrival.
,,,,,,,,"This listing is perfect! The space is very clean, well stocked with toiletries and a hair dryer, and there was coffee and even a few beers in the fridge for us. I slept very soundly and the bed is very cozy tucked into the little sleeping nook. The condo is close to everything and parking and check in is easy. Kristen was very attentive to any questions or needs that arose throughout my stay, and I was so glad! There's even a little seating area that looks east and is perfect for morning coffee time. Five star Superhost! And a five star listing! I loved my experience here! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen communicated thoroughly and the apartment was clean and very convenient to downtown.  The room was sunny and had excellent amenities. The building was quiet and we had a great time. 

I would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Great little condo- really quite and nicely decorated.  Kristen communicated with us throughout the process and made everything easy.  Would Stay here again.  
,,,,,,,,"Great place, quiet, clean and convenient!  Kristen was great about communication and even allowede to check in a little early.  Although I was there for a wedding and didn't have time to explore, I appreciated that Kristen had taken the time to write a short guide to the area with good restaurants/bars and some local's only knowledge.  Great place, will stay there again when visiting Austin!  "
,,,,,,,,"Place was great. Just as it appears on the pictures. It was three of us and it was big enough and comfortable. Check in and out was so easy.  No hassle, no need to meet. Key was easy to find and Kristen's instructions were great. Location is AMAZING! Everything was so close, coffee, food, bars. If u needed UBER to anywhere it was also no more than $5. Just perfect. Also, it had all amenities you could possibly need and if you forgot a toothbrush or shaving cream, there were some travel size things around the bathroom (imagine left over from other people) that would have come handy if needed. We came for a wedding and lots of the people were staying in nearby hotels for triple the price. So, needless to say next time I am visiting Austin I am going to try Kristen again! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean, comfortable & quiet. Check-in could not get any easier. On site parking with a gated entrance. Apartment was clean, well appointed, super quiet and a perfect respite from a busy day of conferencing. Just a couple blocks from UT & their new conference center. "
,,,,,,,,Charming condo in great location! Kristen is a wonderful host. Detailed easy instructions on parking and checking in. Great recommendations on restaurants and sites. The condo is in a quiet neighborhood and a perfect location to U.T. campus and downtown Austin. Condo was clean and comfortable. Appreciate the refreshments in refrigerator upon arrival. Will definitely book a stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,The taxi dropped us off curbside and we had misunderstood what the gate code was. Thankfully Kristen answered my call and gave us the code and we were able to get in. The condo is up three flights of stairs so it was a bit much due to the abnormal amount of luggage we had. The neighborhood is a quiet one and the bed was supper comfy. The condo was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was stocked with coffee which I appreciated first thing in the morning. We were able to catch the bus to S. Congress St just two or three blocks east of the condo. We love Austin and would definitely consider staying here again when we return.  
,,,,,,,,"Great spot, centrally located and perfect for our overnight in Austin. Clean with everything we needed! Thanks!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place!  Perfect location, walking distance, easy communication and entry to place.  Definitely would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and beautiful condo.  Kristen had great recommendations on where to eat.  Austin was easy to get around whether you were biking, walking, or taking public transportation.  Kristin added special homey touches to make this stay comfortable."
,,,,,,,,This was my first visit to Austin and Kristen's place was great! She made it very easy to check-in and even provided an Austin 'cheat-sheet' with restaurant recommendations and places to see. The apartment was very clean and surprisingly spacious! It is an easy 20-min walk to 6th street. Good neighborhood. Highly recommend! 
,,,,,,,,My friend and I only stayed one night. We were quick in and out. It was great for our type of trip. Very homey and in the perfect area. Would definitely book again.
,,,,,,,,Great place. Great Location. Plumber had to come once to fix a leak but it was not too disruptive.
,,,,,,,,Kristen was an excellent host and I absolutely recommend staying here. Plenty of space for a studio and was stocked with thoughtful drinks/snacks which made it feel far superior to any random hotel. Would totally come back!
,,,,,,,,Great apt and great location. Thanks for making our trip so much fun.
,,,,,,,,"I found my stay at Downtown Austin Condo both relaxing and accommodating. The services were outstanding, easy access to downtown and the surrounding area. I didn't get to explore much due to the weather and conference schedule but from what I did see I would def comeback and highly recommend Kristen's place. She kept me informed, the place was spotless and very comfortable."
,,,,,,,,Awesome location & great house. Fantastic experience in Austin.
,,,,,,,,The condo is perfectly located to UT and not far from downtown.  It is extremely comfortable and well appointed. It is so much more convenient than a hotel and saves money! My daughter alerted me to the convenience of this and we both agree it is a great option 
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's condo was perfect for our needs. The location is great and is within walking distance of the Capitol and several restaurants. The neighborhood is quiet, the space is clean, and our dog was welcome. Kristen was responsive to all of our questions and did everything she could to make us feel at home for the night."
,,,,,,,,Our first experience with airbnb. Things could not have gone any better. Location was easy for our needs and directions and info were perfect.  We had flight trouble getting into town and Kristen did a great job keeping in contact with us.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen made my first Airbnb visit a breeze. Though I never met her in person, she was super responsive, and flexible when I needed to check out a little later. The apartment was cute and clean, had all the amenities I needed (hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, tea/sugar, kitchen utensils, internet), and was within walking distance of the AT&T Conference Center/UT Austin. I could nitpick at details, but I'll refrain since overall this place was less expensive but nicer than many hotels I've been to.  If I ever come back to the area, I'd love to stay at Kristen's place again!"
,,,,,,,,"The Downtown Austin Condo was Great! The apartment is clean, nicely decorate and has everything you need.  The Capitol, The university campus and downtown are all within walking distance, but the direct surroundings are calm and friendly. All communications with Kristen goes quick and efficient. Definitely a perfect place when you want to explore downtown Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was just as described and was perfect for few nights stay in Austin. Kristen was very responsive to our needs. Overall the stay was great and I would recommend it!
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our short, one night stay at Kristen's condo. The location was convenient and quiet. Listing was as pictured, clean, the bed was in a cozy lil nook off of the living room. It's on the second floor of the complex. She was easy to correspond with prior to arrival. Overall, no issues whatsoever on our end. "
,,,,,,,,Kristen was very responsive and left clear instructions. She was very helpful. The place was clean and the location was very convenient. Parking was really easy so that made our trip that much more comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place for single/couples, super fast responses!! Very pleasant host, happy to do business! A+++"
,,,,,,,,"The listing was accurate, and the place was terrific.  Well-located near restaurants and stores, plus proximate to UT.  There was even a leftover beer in the fridge!  Would stay here again if in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Communication was good, check-in was simple. The flat was clean and tidy. Everything as described.
The bed is a little noisy, and the shower curtain could be changed, but this is minor details and it was a great stay !"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent place and location. Everything is well organised and the host is very efficient.  The place is perfectly located if you don't have a car, near Guadalupe and Congress av.  Probably in summer is very hot, but there is A/C. (and is TX). The apartment is exactly as the pictures.
I would absolutely come back."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen made this trip so easy.  She was incredibly helpful with tips on how to get to and from the airport before we arrived, and her instructions on how to get into the condo when we arrived were perfect.  She was nice enough to leave a list of recommendations and fun things to do in the city.  The apartment was clean and was the perfect place for my friends and I to explore Austin.  There was one issue with the water while we were there, but Kristen was on it and it was resolved within the hour.  It was an easy walk to South Congress and 6th Street, which made it easy to explore the city.  I will definitely be recommending this condo to friends traveling to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great little spot to drop in for a couple nights and a solid location.  Very straightforward and easy directions from the host, and lots of cool stuff to peruse on the coffee table about things to check out in Austin.  For the price, this place is hard to beat."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen is a great host, made us feel very welcome. Instructions were super informative and accurate. The apartment was exactly as described in the listing. Neighborhood is southwest of UT campus and very near pretty much everything you'd want to see in Austin, and walkable to UT and the Capitol. Apartment was spotless and comfortable. The only hiccup during our stay was that someone actually tried to get into the apartment after midnight! Apparently, the next Airbnb customer got his dates mixed up and thought he was staying there the same night as we were! Anyway, don't think this was Kristin's fault--she was great, investigated the situation and got back to us as soon as she heard about it--and don't think it'll happen to you, only mentioning it because it was a little scary at the time, and is probably something you wouldn't experience at a hotel or non-Airbnb vacation rental."
,,,,,,,,"(Sorry for the belated review!)

Really awesome apartment. 

Such a good location. It took me 15 minutes to walk down to 6th. 

Apartment is super comfy, clean...everything you need.

I don't know why you wouldn't want to choose this place if you visit Austin?!"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was perfect for our stay in Austin. Central to everything, and looks just like it does in the pictures. I'll probably try to stay there every time I visit Austin in the future."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was such a wonderful host! Her place is the most perfect, adorable condo right on UT campus and minutes from downtown. I truly enjoyed my stay and plan on doing it again sometime soon."
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome.  It's close to the UT Austin campus and worked great as a home-base for taking a class there.  It's in a great neighborhood, close to food, bars, and a cookie place that's open till midnight.  The furnishings are nice and cozy.  Kristi was always super-responsive and friendly.  "
,,,,,,,,"Cozy apartment in a great location within Austin, Texas. Would recommend."
,,,,,,,,Nice apartment which was close to tons of things to do in Austin. Host was friendly and gave us recommendations for things to do.
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. The place was exactly as described. Clean and loved the hand written tips of the area. Loved the stay. Thank you. 
,,,,,,,,"The unit was great, Kristen was very helpful to us, and the location was peaceful and within walking distance of many great things to see and do in Austin. We will definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,This is a good clean condo with convenient parking. Very clear instructions by host and convenient for check-in and out. 
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I am more than satisfied with the experience, the apartment, and my host! I loved it. Kristen's place was in just about the best place I could've ask for, nestled right between downtown and the campus area. We walked very easily to great shopping, delicious food, and even to CVS for a few things I forgot - so easy. There were also some cool old buildings to look at around the area. 

The apartment itself was scrupulously clean. The kitchen was terrific. The bed was too. Water pressure good. Internet solid. It was a safe 'hood, but still it was very nice to be in a place with such snug security. The tiny complex itself is very nice, with a sitting area downstairs. 

Also Kristen left great packets of information for us that came in real handy. I used to live in Austin, but it's grown so much. It was really good to have some information on what was around the place, not just addresses but Kristen's actual feedback on what the places were like. 

Quiet neighborhood while I was there, but it was Christmas so maybe it was quieter than usual. Still, it is a really nice 'hood, as I said safe and pretty friendly (met a lot of people walking their dogs). 

Check in and check out was a breeze. 

I intend to stay here whenever the need and opportunity arises. "
,,,,,,,,The condo was as described.  Check in and out was very simple.  Great location to downtown activities!
,,,,,,,,"The host made me feel comfortable. There were wonderful amenities in the kitchen, and beer in the fridge for the guest. The neighborhood was very nice as well. Walking distance from some of our favorite spots. I would recommend this host to anyone!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Kristen's place was perfect, very comfortable. Everything was very clean and we had everything we needed. It was a great location and we had a nice parking spot. "
,,,,,,,,Another great trip to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Kristin's place was great, very clean and in a great location. She was very accommodating and responsive if I had any questions. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, central to everything.  Even though it's right downtown, we had no problems with noise (disclaimer: we did bring our loud fan b/c we're used to sleeping with it).  
Best host we've ever had!  Easy communication of check-in/check-out and even willing to take time to give us some ideas of what to do in the city.  5 stars easy!"
,,,,,,,,"The location was perfect as it was a close drive to everything. The first day I was there, I did not have a car and so I Lyft-ed everywhere which was easy and most rides were under $10 around downtown. The next few days, I had a rental car which made it a lot easier to get around. The location is also very close to a lot of major streets, but luckily the street itself was not busy. Kristen also had a designated parking space. 

The apartment itself was a cute, simple place with all the necessary amenities. Kristen was very easy and very responsive. She was accessible when needed. Sheets were clean, there were plenty of towels, and there was a drawer of little shampoo and conditioner samples.

I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was as pictured.   Everything was clean. The information Krisren left was very helpful.   The only issue my husband and I had was with the bed.  The mattress was uncomfortable and placed in such a way that you had to crawl in and out of the bed.  We found this to be difficult.  However,  great location."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great for enjoying beautiful Austin. It's clean, comfy, has a full kitchen if you'd like to cook. The neighbourhood is very nice, within walking distance to most sights downtown, and felt very safe. Also the parking below the building took away worrying about finding a parking spot. Kirsten had a very easy system for checking in and out, felt like staying at a friend's house!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first time using airbnb and Kristen made it so simple.  The check in and out instructions were very clear and the recommendations she provided about the neighborhood/city were helpful.  The condo was in a quiet area, but still very close to all the action. We were provided everything we needed and the place was very clean.  Highly recommend Kristen's condo!"
,,,,,,,,"Really clean great apartment. Exactly as described, check in was really easy. Does have quite a lot of stairs so be mindful of you are traveling with a lot of stuff. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time. Condo was very neat & clean. Great location & parking was a huge plus. Kristen was over & beyond expectations with recommendations of places to see & where to eat. LBJ Library gets A+. Tejas was a great deal. The condo is such a great location & has the extras. We'll definitely book again when we go back. Kristen is the 'hostess with the mostess' 
"
,,,,,,,,"The condo was perfect for the one night I was in Austin.  I had asked Kristen for some brunch recommendations and she provided some options and even emailed me some additional later.  Easy location from downtown to Uber in under 10-15 minutes.  Very clean, quiet.  "
,,,,,,,,Very easy - checking in was at our leisure after 3p on the day the rental started. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place in a great location. Exactly as described, the condo was clean and inviting. Easy check-in/check-out â€“ in fact, never even met Kristen, but she was very responsive via emails. Loved that parking was right under the building. Would definitely try to stay here again when visiting Austin in the future. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is nice, much better than a hotel, with a small kitchen and a large living room.  But what makes her place great is the location, just a few blocks south and west of the university on a quiet street.  Like staying in a neighborhood with all the attractions of the university, the Drag, 6th street and more just around the corner."
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay at this Austin Condo. Kristen was very friendly and helpful from the first inquiry, patiently answering a lot of questions from me not just about the apartment but the area in general, including tourist and safety information. She was very flexible about arrival time. From the condo it is an easy walk to the UT campus and downtown restaurants. The condo itself was spacious, comfortable and clean."
,,,,,,,,I had a wonderful stay at Kristen's condo. Everything was exactly as described. I unfortunately got a stain on something and she was super responsive and kind about it. She even accommodated us staying later than the posted check out time. We wished we could have stayed another day. Thanks so much Kristen!! 
,,,,,,,,Kristen was great!!! Cute little place in a great location. We saw a show at Stubbs and chose this spot for convince. We are very pleased and will stay there again. It was clean and Kristen was helpful and friendly. Two thumbs up
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood seemed nice . Close to the university as described.
Did not have time to sight see but looked like a nice area. We need a place for a few nights in between moving house. This was perfect. Good size too. 
We have a baby and were also given a pack n play which really helped a lot.
The place was clean and tidy too which was awesome. Will stay again if needed!"
,,,,,,,,The place is a furnished studio apt/condo in a good location.  Never met the host but she was very responsive via text.  Would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,Our stay at Kristen's place was perfect. Great location. Very nice and clean apartment with everything we needed. Easy check in without any hassle. Am overall great experience. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Kristi made our first experience with Airbnb very easy! She was really quick to respond to our questions, both before we arrived and once we were there (within 3o mins). The apartment had everything we needed, was clean, safe, and was easy to access and park. It was a little further from the ""Downtown"" Austin area, than we had thought, but we are avid walkers and we had rented a car, so it did not pose a huge challenge for us. The only issue we had was with the bed. We travelled as a couple, and one of us ended up on the couch by the second night it was so uncomfortable. We would definitely work with this host again."
,,,,,,,,This condo is in a nice neighborhood near the university of Texas and walking distance to many restaurants.  Highly recommend to anyone visiting the area!
,,,,,,,,"Kristin was quick to respond and very helpful with my situation. The place was exactly as pictured, and extremely clean. I would certainly stay here again when in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice clean place good for a short stay in Austin.  Perfect location in between the U of Texas and Downtown. The A/C was a huge plus, in the Texas heat.  Cable TV is listed as an amenity but it was the most basic of cable only offering local TV and community access.   So if you want to catch the game on ESPN its not an option.   Other wise the place is great. "
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved Kristen's Condo in Austin. The layout is great, place is very clean and location was awesome. The complex itself was nice, the parking garage underneath was ideal and the apartment was very quiet. I couldn't have been happier. I would highly recommend Kristin's condo. It helped create an awesome Austin experience. "
,,,,,,,,Second time staying here and it was great as always! 
,,,,,,,,Kristi was very responsive and helpful. The apartment was clean and attractive and the location is great.  Very convenient to campus and the capitol area.  The building seems safe and well cared for - but be prepared to walk up two flights of stairs.  Only drawback is the bed wasn't real comfortable and it is hard to get into because it is tight against the walls. 
,,,,,,,,Kristen's place was very neat and more orderly than some hotels. We found everything we needed and really enjoyed our stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,The apartment was great. It was clean and seemed much bigger than it was. Close to campus and downtown. Two thumbs up!
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a great host! She greeted us upon arrival and gave us clean towels from the start. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for a short stay. The location was perfect, even for driving purposes (easy to get on highways, parkways, major streets, etc.). In addition, Kristen was very accommodating and understanding to our situation and needs! I would book this place for the next time I visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,We loved staying at Kristen's condo; it matched the description on the listing. I liked the combination of the condo's urban style decoration and the Mediterranean style of the building. We really appreciated having the use of a parking spot underneath the building. The location was perfect for us; we wanted to be downtown to be close to restaurants and stores. There is an interesting restaurant on the same street called Ranch 616 that we really enjoyed. It was nice to walk there in the evening. I would rent this place again in a heartbeat.
,,,,,,,,Kristen gave all the info upfront and it was very easy to check in and get into the room.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was very prompt in all our communications and left us very detailed instructions about how to park and access her place. Her place is very clean, with all the necessities -- I went on a hunt for bandaids and found that even her bathroom drawers were stocked in case you forget toiletries! Overall the apartment is spacious with a very comfy couch and it was great to have non-street parking. The location was also very convenient for food/exploring Austin/etc. "
,,,,,,,,Katy was very accommodating and accepting of us. Thank you :)
,,,,,,,,"Great location, host let us check in early which was appreciated.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood. Within walking distance to UT, shopping, and excellent restaurants. Very well maintained complex and unit. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristi was very helpful and provided concise instructions for check in procedures. Everything was super easy! The apartment was great! It was clean and well decorated. The neighborhood was great and extremely close to the UT campus, restaurants, and 6th Street attractions! We really enjoyed our stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a terrific host - and a lifesaver, too! My daughter and our dogs were traveling across the country, and in Austin we needed some last-minute accommodations.  Within hours of contacting her, Kristen replied and checked us in - even though she was a little nervous about the dogs! Her accommodations are excellent - new, clean, great features - and super centrally located.
With all the nice amenities, including real kitchen, it's a perfect ""home"" in Austin. Kristen was not only great getting us in, but she was also happy to provide helpful hints about Austin.  We would love to go back to Austin - and Kristen's place."
,,,,,,,,"This was a perfect place to stay for a night out in Austin. The condo is clean, comfortable, and spacious. This is so much more appealing that a hotel room! Kristen was quick to respond and easy to deal with. We will definitely stay again and will recommend to friends and family!"
,,,,,,,,"This downtown Austin condo is the perfect home base to explore all of the great things that Austin has to offer. Situated in a quiet neighborhood, the studio style apartment is impeccably clean, comfortable, and has many of the basics that you may need while on the road.

 As a first time visitor to Austin, the apartment provided me the opportunity to live and experience the city like a local, but also provided me with easy access to popular spots in downtown and SoCo. Itâ€™s only a quick 15 minute walk to 6th street, and an easy bike or car trip to great restaurants in Hyde Park and East Austin. 

While I didn't meet Kristi, she was a wonderful host and was proactive in her communications. She was always quick to respond to any questions, and the check-in/out process was seamless. 

I highly recommend this location if you're looking for a quiet respite from the busy downtown and touristy areas of the city, but want easy access to nightlife and great food.  I would gladly stay in Kristiâ€™s apartment again. 
"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was just what we wanted and needed in Austin: a comfortable, quiet place downtown to relax after long days exploring the city and surrounding areas. We'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Clean, convenient - it lived up to the previous reviews. Loved the parking and free wifi. Be sure and check out the sleepy pub a couple of blocks away - the Dog and Duck Pub. Will certainly recommend this listing to friends!"
,,,,,,,,Kristi's place was great and she had everything I needed. Her condo is in a great location and easy access to most of the facilities downtown. She was also very responsive in answering my questions when I arrived in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"everything was good, good location, nice apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen is a great host - clearly wants her guests to be welcome and her place to be the ""go to place"" in downtown Austin.  She does a great job in providing community ideas, a well stocked condo and quick help when needed.  Her condo is conveniently located and provides a nice landing spot for travelers.  My husband, daughter and I felt safe, comfortable and well attended.  We'd stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Austin is an awesome city and the condo was a great home base for us.  The free parking underneath the building was a great asset and having the bus stop within a couple blocks worked well for us.  The buses were easy to use taking us close to everything we wanted to see.  We enjoyed breakfast at Arturo's CafÃ© and later a beer at the Dog & Duck which are both within walking distance of the condo.  I would recommend Austin Bike Tours & Rentals if you like to bike.  The city has bikes that are less expensive to rent but these guys really know the city and gave us some great recommendations.  Check in at the condo was a breeze and Kristen responded very quickly to all correspondence.  We would definitely stay here again.  Thanks Kristen for a lovely stay!  
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is great, it is exactly as advertised and it's perfect for one or two people.  Kristen, herself, was very accommodating -- I was looking for a last minute reservation and she immediately accepted my request and actually got me into the space early so I could get some work done.  The check-in process was clear and concise and easy to follow.  Overall, great experience.  Thanks again."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Great price. Kristen is fantastic. Whole trip went off without a hitch!
,,,,,,,,"Nice apartment and great location! It was able to simply walk around and enjoy the Downtown. If you have a car, there is a parking spot under the building. Kristi was very friendly and helpful, and her recommendations about what to do and places where eat were great. I highly recommend staying here if you are in the Austin area."
,,,,,,,,"I'm recently graduated and traveling around the country solo. Decided to stop off in Austin, Texas for a couple days and stayed at Kristi's apartment. This was my first time using AirBNB and it won't be my last, best idea ever. Cool apartment and great location! For a single girl like myself, I was able to safely walk to and from and all over Austin. I highly recommend staying here if you are in the Austin area, Kristi was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating, allowing me to check in and out when I needed. Thanks y'all and stay weird Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"It was great for me to be able to come in knowing that I would have a nice, private space where I could rest for a night after exploring Austin. The apartment is very conveniently located, and I was able to simply walk around and enjoy the sights of UT Austin, museums and the Capitol. I tried a few of the recommendations Kristen includes in her description and was not disappointed at all, especially the Dive Lounge and Arturo's. Kristen was always prompt in her response whenever I had a question. My only regret is that I had to leave so soon! Will definitely recommend and try to come back as soon as possible."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Nice looking apartment.
,,,,,,,,Nice experience. 
,,,,,,,,Stayed here to attend a friend's graduation. Great spot located conveniently close to UT as well as a few minutes from downtown. Kristen was very accommodating and a great host for making sure we had everything we needed.
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location !  Everything was as advertised "
,,,,,,,,Nice and easy stay
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was timely and gracious with her email communication. The location of the apartment makes walking or biking to many popular spots very easy. If you are driving, there is a dedicated parking spot under the building, so there is no need to search for street parking. The apartment, located in a building with a quaint courtyard, was clean and quite nice. If you will be in Austin, I recommend staying at Kristen's place."
,,,,,,,,"What a great place to stay!  Kristen was a great host and the place was in the perfect location, just right downtown and close to everything, including public transportation.  She even left us a little care package for our stay.. which was definitely appreciated!  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Austin and stay in the downtown area.  Great place!  Thanks Kristen!"
,,,,,,,,The condo was exactly as advertised and we had a very nice stay.  Would definitely stay there again.
,,,,,,,,Our stay was awesome. The condo was extremely clean and had everything we needed. Kristen was so helpful and attentive. Very quick responses and she had some great recommendations-she made herself very available. Hope to stay at one of her places again soon :)
,,,,,,,,"The accommodation was perfect for what we needed.  Great facilities, and super easy check in/out.  Would definitely recommend Kristen as a host. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Kristen's Condo was great a great experience!  Kristen was a good communicator and accommodated all of our needs.  Her place was very clean and in a good location, and perfect for our staying while we were in town for a wedding.  Pro-tip: two blocks south was a great food truck called the Jalopy.  Two blocks north was an cookie ice cream sandwich place open until midnight! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's apartment was perfect for our stay in Austin. Great location, extremely easy check in and check out, spotless, and comfortable.  We had absolutely no complaints and highly recommend that anyone visiting Austin should stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"There are too many excellent things to say about the accommodations provided by Kristen.  If you like exploring by foot, this is the place to stay in downtown Austin.  If you walk a mile in either direction you will find yourself at the steps of the Capital, dodging students on the UT campus, or grabbing a fresh pastry from Houndstooth downtown.  If you'd rather pedal around there is a Bcycle station two blocks away.  Kristen's condo was aces!!  After a long day hiking around the bed was both welcome and comfortable.  If you're looking to save some cash and want to dine in you have a fully stocked kitchen at your disposal.  We were in town for a wedding so we were very happy to see that there was an iron in house, as well as laundry in the complex.  I've already told many of my friends that have Austin on their short list for travel to contact Kristen for a gold medal stay.  Thanks Kristen!!!"
,,,,,,,,Kristen was an excellent host and made our stay very comfortable. We didn't have a chance to meet but she was very accommodating and her condo is terrific.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a phenomenal host. The place was clean and in tip top shape. Get Internet was blazing fast for those hours when I had to do a lot of work. Overall, it was a fun experience and I would recommend her place again if you're every in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome, clean condo in a great location! Highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is in a great location in downtown Austin.  We were able to find it and get inside the apartment easily. The area was quiet but very central.  The apartment was clean and had everything we needed (plus a few extras) for our weekend stay.  The coffee provided in the apartment was nice too, although we headed over to ""The Underground"" just a few blocks away for delicious coffee and breakfast.  "
,,,,,,,,"The condo was perfect for our visit! It was exceptionally clean, nicely decorated. There were even some amenities! It is in a great location within an easy and nice walk to everything downtown.  We saw a show at ACL Live and it was just a short 15 minute walk with plenty of bars, restaurants and shops on the way. We love visiting Austin and would love to stay in Kristen's condo again. Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice, clean, simple apartment.  Had everything I needed. I was able to use the bicycle share nearby on 17th and Guadalupe to tour downtown Austin and the university nearby."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's downtown condo was great for my boyfriend and my weekend trip to Austin. You couldn't ask for a better location where there is a lot within walking distance. The apartment itself was clean when we arrived and pretty spacious. Some coffee, booze, and snacks were left in the kitchen and a couple of toiletries in the bathroom as well. Just a heads up, the cable provided is just basic and not much more than ABC, NBC, etc. are available. Kristen was extremely prompt with communication and gave clear instructions for our stay. Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend staying at Kristen's place!"
,,,,,,,,"We made a very last minute reservation with Kristen, and she was more than accommodating to my boyfriend and I! Her place was very neat, perfect for a couple, and in a very ideal place if one wants to get to know Austin. I would recommend Kristen's place to anyone, and if we are ever to visit Austin again, we would definitely stay here! Thanks so much!"
,,,,,,,,Definitely would stay here again. Great location. Easy to contact. Great space.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen is a very good host. She is is easy to contact and helpful.
The condo is is a great location...walking distance to many venues. It is located in a nice quiet area. We try to stay in this condo unit when we go to Austin. The kitchen is minimally equipped so if you want to cook bring supplies.    "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was super helpful and her place is clean, comfortable and conveniently located. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Awesome place. Lots of space for two. Very clean and comfortable.

Central location, perfect if you also want to check out the campus. We did a tone of walking so bring comfortable shoes. Cabs are not the easiest to find. 
"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at this apartment! It was a very last minute booking (we decided we needed to stay in Austin another night) and we were so quickly and hospitably accommodated! Great location to downtown Austin, easy parking, lovely apartment. Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen, as always, it was a pleasure.  Great space, great location, great host.  My go-to for Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was very responsive. The apartment was clean and tidy, and had everything I needed. The location is also great. "
,,,,,,,,"Places just as described, very clean.  On a quiet street in a great location to see downtown Austin.  I booked the place last minute, and Kristen was able to get it ready for me not only on time, but early.  Great experience and would definitely recommend."
,,,,,,,,Great all around. Location was fantastic. Host was accommodating and the process was super simple. Will definitely stay here again next time in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Kristen, made checking in and out so easy! The apartment is spotless and perfect for any length of stay in Austin. We literally had everything we needed for a long weekend. She left us coffee, sodas, a few beers and all the necessities. 

We're planning on coming back to Austin for SXSW and will be trying to stay with Kristen!"
,,,,,,,,Convenient location.  Well kept apartment.  Couldn't ask for more!   
,,,,,,,,Cozy place in a convenient location. Kristi was a great host. The fridge was full of drinks and the bathroom was stocked with toiletries. I would definitely recommend using one of her condos if you're planning a trip to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Very nice place and very close to everything we wanted to see in Austin. I recommend this condo if your staying for business or pleasure.
,,,,,,,,My boyfriend and I stayed at this condo and loved it! Very clean and modern with a nice-sized bathroom and kitchen. Perfect for 1-2 people. It is in a quiet neighborhood close to the Capitol and a 15-20 minute walk from the fun parts of 6th St. I highly recommend this place! 
,,,,,,,,Stayed an extra night after a company retreat for Pebble Technology. Kristen's pad was wonderful and I would totally stay again whenever my travels find me in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Wow. Where to start? This was our first AirBnB experience, so my girlfriend and I now have some incredibly high standards thanks to Kristen. The condo was in a great location, close to campus, close to the bus, close to the Capitol building, and for the price it couldn't be passed up. Booking it was no hassle and luckily we got in on a weekend without Longhorns football goers to contend with. This is all before we got there. 

With a week to go, we had the customary checkin, and Kristen pointed out that it would be a bit chilly and we should prepare. Little did we know that it was almost historically cold, as we ""escaped"" a dark and stormy San Francisco week into a frigid 38Â° weekend in Austin. Kristen was apologetic the whole time, and kept telling us about how we have to come back when it's hot and how it's totally different, but we still had a great time. 

The condo was warm and she stocked it with a pound of coffee, which we made a pretty big dent in considering the weather. Everything was neat and cozy and was perfect for a short weekend. 

But the best was still coming. When the end of the weekend came, our flights were a little off and we were there past the regular checkout time. Luckily for us there weren't any people checking in on Sunday or Monday so she said it was OK to stay, and then as we're packing up, she shows up to straighten things up and without any hesitation offers us a ride to the airport. We wholeheartedly appreciated the gesture and the ride over was like one last tour of Austin. By the end of it I was ready to plan our next trip right then and there!

Long story short, Kristen made us feel so at home after three days of bad weather in a vibrant town and I feel like I'm obligated to take her up on her offer to come back when it's warm. If it works out hopefully we can stay with her again!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay in Austin at Kristen's place. It was as advertised, with plenty of space, clean, and quite convenient to downtown Austin. She was helpful as well in giving me tips on Austin and helping me get a cab for the airport. I would highly recommend her listing and would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,Kristen was a nice host for my first AirBnB experience. She communicated with me before the trip and made sure I knew what to expect. Her condo was in nice condition and as she advertisted. She even came by with some extra drinks for the fridge for us during our visit. The condo is well located - we were able to walk to both a UT game and to downtown without any problems. 
,,,,,,,,"The location can't be beat. Its close enough to West 6th and downtown to be fun, but remote enough to be quiet. I've always loved this neighborhood. Its an easy walk to campus, downtown, and SoCo (SoCo is about 2 miles, but its flat and there's lots to look at as you go, so its really nice). If you're taking the bus to/from the airport, its about a mile or so to the stop.

Everything was clean and Kristen was really a phenomenal host. She let us check in early and leave late, which we appreciated. Overall, great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay when I attended a conference on the UT campus. Short walk to the campus, safe neighborhood. The condo was very comfortable. I appreciated that there was coffee and some drinks and food available, although the kitchen is probably not well stocked enough (pots & pans, tools, etc) allow you to cook a meal. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's condo was perfect. It was very comfortable. The location was great as well. It would have been an easy bike ride or a longer walk to the central downtown area. We had a rental car, so having the garage below the condo was really nice. Kristen was also very responsive to any questions we had during out stay. Highly recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"My wife love it, great place and location. Fantastic
Will come back again for sure soon.
Great host, always attending to our needs
We have a total of 4 airbnbs in this trip, this came out tops! 
5 stars *****
"
,,,,,,,,"We made a last minute decision to stay in Austin and Kristen was very quick to respond. Her apartment was very clean and was in a great location. It took only a couple of minutes to walk to a bus stop, and from there it did not take long at all to get to 6th st. We will definitely be looking into staying at her apartment again next time!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great apartment close to downtown and UT. The unit itself is very clean and simple with all the space and amenities that I needed for my 3 day stay. It was so close to everything in fact that I ended up not renting a car and either walking around or taking the bus--for example when I went to down to South Congress. Kristen even immediately responded when I asked if she had a iron, and brought one over the next day. I will definitely stay here again if it is available on my next trip. "
,,,,,,,,"Our first attempt at using Air BnB was a success thanks to Kristi and her prompt communication ... the condo was clean and in a great location, just a couple blocks away from UT and short driving distance from everything we wanted to experience in Austin. My boyfriend and I had a great trip and we'd look to see if the condo is available next time we're in ATX! "
,,,,,,,,"This was our second stay at Kristen's place! It was is amazing. My wife and I were visiting for ACL, and this was the perfect place to come home to after the craziness of an all day Festival. This is now our ""go to"" place to stay while visiting Austin.  Great price, great location, and great host! You can't beat it! "
,,,,,,,,"I had a really nice stay at this condo. It is very clean and modern with great space. The host was pleasant to communicate with and very accommodating. She even let me check in early for a much needed nap before the wedding. I would stay again for sure!
"
,,,,,,,,Great stay for the price and location. Would recommend!
,,,,,,,,Kristen's place was very nice and spacious. Very clean and quiet with easy and free parking. Was centrally located and very easy to get to downtown 6th street and s Congress. We ended up driving around for convenience since it was a weekday but I imagine you could walk to 6th st or take a very short can ride. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend staying at Kristen's condo. 
,,,,,,,,"A great stay. Kirsten's place was exactly as described, with excellent communication before booking, after booking, and during the stay. The place was easy and convenient to find, and Kristen had stocked the place with snacks, water, and local beer, which was a great welcome after a long day of travel."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place to stay for both pleasure and business in Austin. A spacious and clean place, with everything you need within close distance. I would definitely stay here in again! "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was exactly what I needed for my quick exploration of Austin. Kristen was quick in communication and the transaction was effortless from beginning to end. The apartment was clean and the wireless internet worked great. Thank you Kristen! 
,,,,,,,,Kristen was so flexible and quick to respond.  She made my trip to Austin easy and carefree and I am grateful for that. The unit was just as the pictures showed and it was very clean and comfortable.  Nothing like staying in a 'home' away from home.  Thank you Kristen!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic experience! I was heading to Austin on a 2 month project for work and needed a place to stay in a short notice. Tired of the hotel scene, I wanted to try something different. At first I was a little skeptical but after my conversation with Kristen I felt at ease and decided to go with her condo. VERY Glad I did! The condo was very nice and located in a good area and quiet location. Beats and hotel any day of the week if you ask me. She also came by once a week to clean up and change the bedding/towels. (She also folded my clothes that were in my laundry basket...how cool)
I would definitely recommend Kristens place anytime you stay in Austin! Thanks again Kristen!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Our 2nd stay at Kristen's place, Perfect location, good experience
"
,,,,,,,,"Condo was clean and just as advertised. Located in a quiet neighborhood close to downtown, this is a place that is not only convenient but ideal for a relaxing get a way. Owner was very helpful with directions & even provided a complimentary gift of snacks & wine. I highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately I did not get to stay at Kristen's apartment due to a mix-up, but she booked us at a very nice hotel downtown very quickly. It was a pleasure dealing with Kristen,with prompt and clear communication both before and during our stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and space.  Walkable to lots of shops, bars, and restaurants.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  

"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's condo was absolutely perfect!  I stayed here for a little over a month to attend a summer intensive class at UT, and the location was perfect.  So close to everything!  2 minute drive to downtown, 10 minute walk to campus!  Comfy bed, large walk in closet, lots of counter space, and all the necessities needed for a weekend getaway or a long term rental!!  Super close to downtown, but located in a nice tree shaded QUIET area!!  Convenient parking underneath the building too, and nice front load washers/dryers in the laundry room a few doors over from the unit!!  Kristen was also a great host, and great with communication (usually instant responses to any questions I had).  I recommend her and her units to anyone needing a place to stay in Austin, and will not hesitate to stay here again!  Thanks Kristen!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect Prime location!  Very nice and clean condo. Small, private and quiet complex / neighborhood. Safe gated parking. Kristen was very helpful and prompt with emails, and texts. Highly recommend condo and location. We already booked condo for August. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a great host because she always responded promptly to my emails and requests. She definitely takes care of her place and is easy to book with. 
The condo was great! Very clean, easy to get to, with convenient covered parking, and very affordable. It's perfect for 2 people, but we made 3 work with one on the couch. Would definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is Amazing!! Very clean, cute, and centrally located. Parking was easy, and the complex is gated. We felt very safe. Kristen was very attentive, and polite. We will definitely be staying at her place again!  "
,,,,,,,,"I spent a month in this condo. It has all the creature comforts, modern, clean, and close to everything.  Located in the arts district, you have many options for restaurants, coffee shops etc., and only a 15 minute walk to downtown Austin's west 6th st.  Highly recommend.  The whole experience was easy and painless. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place!! Great Location, minutes away from the University of Texas and The State Capital.  

The condo was very clean and modern.
Next time I'm in town, I will be looking to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,This was by far one of the best short term rental experiences we've had.  The owner was extremely responsive and the apartment was perfect.  We will definitely by trying to stay here again at the next available opportunity.

I spoke with Roel prior to arriving and I met Roel and his wife the night I got in.  They showed me around and were very easy going. I feel that they would have addressed any issues if I had had any.  

The location was perfect for everything I needed and wanted to do.  And the bed was super comfy!   Having the convenience of a parking spot also made this place well worth the stay.    

I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it.  Thanks for everything! "
3432834,4.5,10,10,9,10,10,9,"This is a great location to explore multiple areas in Austin! Close to a bus stop and short walks to all of the restaurants and nightlife on the east side, downtown, and Rainey Street. I loved the unique yard. The host was super helpful and responsive to any needs and updates. "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was very responsive. The casita is cute and well located in East Austin with good restaurants, food trucks, and cool music venues. It cost a few dollars to take a cab from Rainey street and is very walkable to the main attractions. We had the best brisket sandwich at La barbecue and bike around with the two bikes provided. It is not for late sleepers because of all this natural light and noises, but allows you to start your day earlier. Also we brought to her attention that the cleaning crew could do a better job. Cool place, nice vibe, and  amiable hostess. Nice stay overall!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is simply amazing! There's a certain kind of magic to Jennifer's cozy cottage located in East Cesar Chavez (which is close to everything by the way). Maybe it's the scenic garden you walk through to get to the front door. Maybe it's the sun shining through the stained glass window in the shower. Maybe it's the soothing sounds of rustling leaves as you fall asleep in this quiet neighborhood. Whatever it might be, don't hesitate to book a few nights here if you're planning a trip to Austin. You're steps away from Cesar Chavez, which can easily connect you to the city's flashy 6th Street, or a more laid back vibe on South Congress. Jennifer even has 2 bikes for you to use, which make for an amazing way to tour Austin like a local. Jennifer is quick with communication and attentive, and even invited us to a bonfire in her backyard! If you want a tranquil stay in the city while still being steps away from food trucks, nature, and night life, look no further than Jennifer's cottage."
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer always responded quickly to any of my queries.  She is friendly and commiserated with me after the Donald was elected.

No TV, and that's a good thing!
"
,,,,,,,,We adored our stay with Jennifer - she couldn't have been more helpful throughout our trip and we didn't want to leave our cozy Austin cabin!
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer's place is an awesome cozy place to stay if you're ever in Austin! The place is a super easy walk right to the city center and most places
 you would want to go. 

Jennifer is also super nice, very helpful, and super communicative. Great host!"
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I absolutely loved our stay in Jennifer's cottage retreat. There was a mini-fridge to keep snacks and drinks cold in addition to a cupboard of drink ware, coffee maker (grounds-only), and microwave. I especially loved the pretty tile work on the updated bathroom floor. We got a lot of natural light in the cottage throughout the day without the need to turn on lamps. There is also a ceiling fan for those days when the Texas sun beats down.  We really enjoyed our peaceful stay on the property and want to go back already! Also, Jennifer was also a lovely person to meet in person as she is a longtime Austin resident and knows about all of the parks and natural retreats in the area. For animal lovers, there are two adorable goats, a dog, a kitty, and a tortoise on the property as well to befriend. If you want to stay in a relaxing, quiet area near downtown and the Rainey Street bars, I recommend seeing if Jennifer's cottage is available. "
,,,,,,,,"This cottage has a great location and price but is held back by its cleanliness and size. 

Let me start by saying that Jennifer is a great host. She was communicative and attentive to our needs and satisfactorily provided solutions to our issues. Checking in was easy and the environment surrounding the property is pleasing. A dog and two goats live outside in the main house yard next to the cottage and they were fun to interact with! Jennifer provided two bikes for my wife and I to explore the city and they were perfect for our needs. The location is great for accessing most restaurants, bars, and attractions in the downtown Austin area. 

We did have a few issues unfortunately. When we arrived, the room obviously had not been cleaned since the previous guests had left. The bed was unmade, towels were dirty, the toilet had not been flushed, the floor had not been vacuumed, and there was trash in the room. We immediately notified Jennifer and she was extremely apologetic and offered us the first night free. This was acceptable since we weren't able to actually use the room until 8pm when our check-in time was 3pm. Jennifer cleaned the room herself and had really good recommendations for what to do and where to eat during our stay. 

Once the room itself was cleaned the stay became more enjoyable. However, there are some other problems we encountered. The lodging didn't have the greatest of amenities, most notably with shampoos, soaps, and toilet paper. Investing in small bottles of shampoo and new soap for guests would go a long way. Also, we were only provided with a single roll of toilet paper for our trip. We asked for more and Jennifer provided one additional roll. Instead of asking every time we needed more we ended up just buying our own from the store as well as new soap. Finally, the room itself is quite small for two people. The bed is small and half the windows did not have curtains which stifled our privacy. 

These issues keep the overall rating from exceeding 3 stars. I can't speak highly enough of Jennifer and the way she handled issues as they arose. All of the recommendations she provided enhanced our stay in Austin. The location, price, and Jennifer's attentiveness added a lot to the value but could not compensate for the other issues we experienced. I would recommend this lodging if you are by yourself and none of the problems described here are notable. "
,,,,,,,,"A wonderful place to stay in Austin! Jennifer was such a nice host, we had everything we needed! The cottage was super charming and authentic, and the location was just perfect - quiet, but next to a lot of very cool restaurants, coffee shops and bars with live music! I reccomend!"
,,,,,,,,"What a great stay we had here.
Jennifer was a great, warm and friendly host who made our stay such a welcome one. She was always in touch prior to our trip and gave loads of suggestions for our stay . the place itself is a little larger than in the photos with a great bed and shower. There's no kitchen but there is a microwave , kettle and fridge. It lies at the back of a lovely garden which feels private and has hammocks too.On the other side of the wire fence are 2 lovely goats a friendly dog and a reclusive tortoise. I would only recommend bringing insect repellent for the odd mosquito.(although Jennifer had some already).
The location is fantastic as it is on a quiet residential road but you're a 20 min walk from downtown Austin and a ten minute walk from East 6th street were the bars are. Around the corner is a cat cafe! As a vegetarian, there were loads of places to eat within walking distance too. 
If we stay in Austin again, we'd stay here again. 
 "
,,,,,,,,"A great Airbnb experience! We enjoyed the neighbourhood, and really liked the space, it was perfect for the two of us. Convenient parking was a nice amenity, and Jennifer was very friendly. We had a wonderful time in Austin, and this was a great home base. "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was an excellent and enthusiastic host. It was easy to communicate with her via text. We found the place charming, cozy, well-equipped and very conveniently located. "
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Jenniferâ€™s cottage. The cottage itself was quaint, cozy, and clean -- perfect for couples. It had a small fridge to store drinks and food along with a cupboard containing coffee and teas. The best part was the cottageâ€™s close proximity to all of Austinâ€™s hot spots, such as E 6th St., Rainey St., food trucks, and even the state capitol -- a five to ten-minute drive. Jennifer also provided two bicycles to get around town but we never got around to using them.

Jennifer was also very accommodating and quick to respond to texts. Before arriving, Jennifer sent us a message with all the information needed to get to the cottage along with a helpful list of must-see local attractions.

Iâ€™d highly recommend Jenniferâ€™s cottage to any couple looking to have a worry-free stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at Jennifer's garden cottage!!   Very lush, secluded, and quiet backyard.  We stayed in July and the temps were in the 100s, we were super pleased that the AC was kickin' when we arrived!  We were very comfortable and cool during our stay and even slept with the quilt over us.  Jennifer provided two bikes + bike locks for us, we used them every day... Austin is so bike friendly and the cottage is in such a perfect location!!  We took the beautiful bike trail along the river that took us to Barton Springs/Botanical Gardens.  The cottage comes with a little mini fridge and microwave, which was good because we had lots of leftovers.  She provides cups/mugs but not plates+utensils.  Bathroom was great, good shower pressure and water temps and lots of towels!  Bed is firm and mattress size is FULL, but we were very comfortable and slept well every night.  If you like a little more Queen size / King Size space between you and your sleeping partner you may feel a little cramped.  I hope we visit Austin again, we loved it SO much!!  We visited a lot of Jennifer's suggested stops and had the best time.  "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was very friendly and helpful and easy to reach! She gave us good suggestions for things to do in Austin. The location was awesome--an easy walk to a great cafe, bars, and restaurants. Three of the windows don't have curtains or blinds so it got pretty light in the morning and the internet kept cutting out, but otherwise the cottage was clean and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was really cute. One of the dogs in the yard is still kind of a puppy so it jumped on me a lot, but if you're a dog lover then you'll enjoy it. "
,,,,,,,,"It was a very safe, clean, comfortable place, just as advertised. I enjoyed my stay, and I would recommend it to others."
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our experience at Jennifer's place in Austin! It was really like a cozy cabin in the middle of the city. Very clean, bed was comfy, bathroom was room and nice!
The place is very well located. Some places were only a 10 minute or less walk away. Also near to the Lady Bird Lake hike & bike trail. We didn't use the bikes at the bnb but they looked like they were in good condition and you'd be able to get to tons of places by bike very quickly!
We didn't meet Jennifer in person but she was very communicative, responded quickly when we messaged her, and I'm sure would have been available very fast had we needed her. "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer's cottage was exactly as expected! She was traveling during our stay but was very communicative leading up to and during our visit and had an in-town back up to help us out if needed, it was very much appreciated! It is a small place, but we were really just there to rest our heads between our adventures and it did the job! Great location, everything we wanted to do in Austin was accessible via walking, Car2Go, or biking. She even provided two bikes perfect for cruising around the lake trail and beach towels for swimming trips. The bathroom is surprisingly large for a small place, so it was perfect for sharing and getting ready together."
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay at Jennifer's zen garden cottage! Her description is accurate, and she gave us friendly, welcoming guidance with detailed emails leading up to our stay. Everything worked fine: locks, electricity, plumbing, etc. The bathroom was more spacious than we expected and beautifully decorated. When a problem arose, Jennifer was exceptionally prompt, responsible, and generous in resolving the situation. We would gladly stay at Jennifer's zen garden cottage again."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Jennifer's place was very nice. We had some bikes ready but we didn't need them, because the most things where in walking distance. The cottage was great and clean and Jennifer was offering every help we needed."
,,,,,,,,"The best part of this Air BnB was the location. We were in town for a festival, but it got rained out so we rented a car, but honestly you wouldn't need to. It was a short walk to about 100 funky bars and restaurants or to connect with an amazing hike/bike system that we followed for miles until we found ourselves 10 miles away swimming at a waterfall. 
Jen was glad to point us in the right direction.
The house was tiny, but we weren't there much so it didn't matter. The yard was quaint but full of mosquitos... not to worry though, there was plenty of bug spray in the cottage. 
Couldn't beat the location! There was a mini fridge, coffee maker and microwave for the essentials. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay in East Austin. Sharing the yard with two very friendly neighbors (with two very adorable dogs), it had a cozy and natural feeling to it. The place consists of a bedroom and a bathroom - very close quarters but that didn't bother my girlfriend and I. We were delighted to see the small air conditioner in the window upon arrival, as it was hot and humid during our days there. The bicycles were probably the best part about this place. Having never been to Austin, the bikes allowed us to ride everywhere we wanted to go, exploring without the need to use Uber all the time. We recommend hitting the bike path and following it west toward Zilker Park - it's a great ride. 

Altogether we loved our stay! If I had to name a negative, it would be that the trash hadn't been taken our prior to our visit, and it looked like the floors could use a bit of vacuuming. But that didn't really bother us all that much. We'd happily stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was yet another good Airbnb experience. The listing was accurate and there were no unpleasant surprises. One thing that did surprise me was the extremely close proximity to the boardwalk on Lady Bird Lake. The two bikes that were available were in working order and were a great addition to our trip. Jennifer was a great host as well and was extremely communicative throughout my stay. The place is small, but more than enough if you plan to spend your days out and about in this vibrant city. 9/10 would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,Jennifer was great about communicating about check in/out and reaching out to make sure we were settling in well. The little house was charming and was just what we expected based on Jennifer's description. We were in town for a conference at the Austin Convention Center and it was a quick easy walk to the center every day and also a very quick walk to Rainey Street which has a bunch of cute bars and restaurants which we enjoyed.  The neighborhood was surprisingly quiet for being so close to everything and the yard was very private and relaxing. 
,,,,,,,,"In the back of a pleasant meadow-like garden, this cottage is cosy and convenient. It definitely is compact - but was perfect for just one person - and with the outdoor veranda would be good for two people as well. The location is good - a few blocks to hip bars and food trucks along East 6th St - and craft beer fans should definitely check out Bangers and Craft Pride on Rainey St, also just a few blocks away. Jennifer was very responsive before and during my stay, and I have no hesitation in recommending this cottage as a base for exploring the cool city of Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing time at Jennifer's little get away. The location was perfect, probably my favorite area of Austin. Walking distance from great restaurants, Food trucks and more. The bikes that are available really helped get around. Jennifer was super helpful in directing us to some great eating spots and other activities.  The small backyard area was perfect and peaceful for a morning coffee. We went for SXSW and it was perfect.  "
,,,,,,,,"The location is wonderful and Jennifer is a very welcoming host (though I did not meet her in person). I loved most things about the cottage, but there was one upsetting thing - I saw several cockroaches in the bathroom. I hope that problem gets dealt with. 

On a positive note, I also liked the interior decor and the lawn outside. 

"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay in Austin at this garden cottage get away! Our host was so inviting and friendly and made sure to have every possible accommodation we could need! The added bonus of bicycles was the cherry on top! We were able to bike around downtown and see so much more of the city than would have been possible otherwise. We had the best time!! We loved that it was private and yet very close to restaurants and all the ""action"".  We would highly recommend a stay here unless you are tall - we aren't and the bed was a good size for us but I'd worry if you require some leg room. Also there isn't a lot of storage space if you have a lot to unpack and want to stash your bags somewhere. But it was very clean, loved the window in the bathroom and very cozy. "
,,,,,,,,"It's ""Tiny"" , but surprisingly the 2 of us never felt on top of each other nor were we bumping into each other. Our favorite part were the bikes! The location is great. We were within a 15min bike ride from the most distant destinations on our itinerary. Cenote is great & became our planning headquarters every morning for breakfast :-)
   Jennifer gave great easy directions & has a great list of what to see & do. Austin is a great Yelp town. Trust Yelp. (We're from Charlotte, where Trip Advisor or (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) ratings are better indicators)"
,,,,,,,,"We had a lovely time in Austin. The cottage was small, as advertised, but was more than enough space for us and was in an excellent location for exploring the city. The neighborhood is in an up-and-coming area--it was very easy to get around, especially thanks to the bikes that were made available to us. The cottage is a short walk or bike ride away from La Barbecue, bars on East 6th, and lots of other excellent food and nightlife. Even Barton Springs, which is about as far as we ventured, is a lovely a 20-30 minute bike ride along the river.

The cottage itself is in a cute garden, set back behind a bigger house. The place was clean and neat when we arrived.

We didn't meet with Jennifer in person, but she did a great job communicating with us before, during, and after our stay. She also sent a list of some of her favorite spots in the city before the trip, which was much appreciated. Overall, we had a great trip!"
,,,,,,,,"The Artsy, Zen garden cottage is amazing. It was the perfect place to stay. Clean and comfortable. Close to everything with plenty of cool places to walk to. 

I really dug Cenote Cafe down the street from the cottage. Neighbors were friendly. Overall, a very ""real"" place to stay. Definitely makes you feel like a local. Will stay here again. Jennifer was super helpful as well.

Austin rocks!"
,,,,,,,,"This cottage is walkable to the convention center and was convenient for my business trip needs. Despite Jennifer being out of town, she was helpful, communicative, and quick to respond. Cenote is conveniently nearby and on the way to the convention center and was a great place to grab coffee and breakfast. Love the cow skull, too!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time in Austin and I loved the vibe of Jenniferâ€™s cottage! Jennifer was quick to respond to all of my messages and offered a lot of helpful hints for planning our trip. The cottage is tiny, as advertised, but cute, quiet, and appropriate for what we needed, since we were out most of the time. If youâ€™re tall keep in mind that the cottage has a full bed, my 6ft tall boyfriend was a little cramped at night. The cottage is in an ideal location and we were able to walk to a ton of restaurants, coffee shops, food trucks, and bars (including 6th Street and Rainey Street). We also took advantage of having bikes available and rode along the Colorado River on the hiking/biking trail to Barton Springs (highly recommended if you go!). If we were feeling lazy, we would take an Uber to parts of the city, and each ride was at most 5 minutes away. We were a little surprised on our first day there when 2 dogs came running up to us in the yard but they were very friendly, the yard was kept clean, and we only saw them a few times during our 5 day stay. Overall, we had a wonderful time in Austin would definitely go back!"
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer made planning our trip to Austin so easy! She is quick to reply to messages and has recommendations for all tastes. The cottage is perfect for one person or a cozy getaway for a couple. Austin was freezing during our stay but space heaters kept us warm. We took ubers around the city and it was always cheap given the central location of the cottage. There are a few cute breakfast places around. We highly recommend the Blue Cat Cafe for lunch if you are a cat person! Thank you for making our first visit to Texas unforgettable, Jennifer :)"
,,,,,,,,"Delightful, quirky place, amazingly well-situated to explore East Austin as well as walk to any business you might need to conduct downtown. So glad I stayed here instead of my conference hotel. Having bikes available was awesome. Some of the high windows do not have curtains â€“ this is not an issue for privacy at all, but if you have trouble sleeping with light in the room, bring your eye mask. There is also a lower window behind the bed that I did opt to cover with a large scarf I had with me, since I felt a little exposed even though it looks out on lush backyard greenery. I did not meet Jennifer in person, but she was very solicitous, and I'm sure would have helped me out with a window covering if I had asked. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was great to deal with. She kept the communication open and answered any questions I had. The location was ideally located only minutes from downtown and 6th street (and for our needs, the convention center). Overall, we had a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer's cottage was perfect for my stay in Austin. Walking distance to everywhere I needed to go, yet lovely and cozy and warm for when the endless rain kept me inside. Jennifer was quick to respond when there was an issue with the wifi, and it was fixed promptly and gave me no more issues from then on.

I will be returning to Austin to explore in dry weather and wouldn't hesitate to book here again. "
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying here and it was our perfect introduction to Austin. The cottage was really comfy and attractively done out, in a secluded back garden in a very pretty part of east Downtown â€“  just 10 mins' walk from East Austin nightlife (Sixth Street and around) or the bars on Rainey Street, and just a few mins from great breakfast tacos and the Kerlin Barbeque (highly recommended!). Sadly we didn't get to meet Jennifer but she was very welcoming and super-helpful with tips and advice both before and during our stay. We'd 100% stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was very welcoming and provided great pointers of restaurants and bars in the local area. Her cottage was ideal for my first trip to Austin. I absolutely loved the area and how quiet it was. It was perfect walking distance to downtown, always stopped by the coffee shop Cenote on my way to downtown in the mornings. I am already trying to plan my next trip to Austin and am hoping I'm able to book this cottage with Jennifer again. Definitely want to stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at this tiny house!  As a few others have said, it's perfect for one or two people, more than that would be too crowded.  The location couldn't have been better, we could walk to Rainey street, East 6th, West 6th, and pretty much anywhere else we wanted to explore.  We didn't actually meet Jennifer, but we were out and about the majority of the time we were visiting anyway.  Lots of good food nearby, etc."
,,,,,,,,"Great stay - location is good, bed was comfy, and the whole setting was very charming. Jennifer was a super attentive host and solved a few small issues we had with no problem. I'd definitely recommend you stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"The cottage is very cute, nice, and clean. The location was perfect for us and we were able to walk everywhere. Amazing coffee at Texas Coffee Traders and an awesome taco truck are within a few blocks. It was a bit smaller than expected, which was fine since we spent most of our time out, not enough space to have meals in the room though. Overall, it was a great experience and Jennifer was a lovely host. Great value for the price. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying in Jens cottage was fantastic. She gave great tips on things to do in Austin, and made us feel welcome. The little house was exactly what we needed for our get away. The neighborhood is nice and surprisingly quiet for being so close to so many attractions. "
,,,,,,,,The cottage was great. The location is perfect for exploring Austin. I loved chilling on the front porch. Jennifer went above and beyond to be helpful.
,,,,,,,,"Rustic Texan charm! We loved staying at Jennifer's cottage in Austin. Walking distance to just about everything, but tucked away just enough to ensure a quiet night's sleep. We could resist taking a selfie with the cow skull that greeted us on arrival! "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was very communicative during the days approaching our trip. She was out of the country during our stay but we had everything we needed. The room was cool when we entered which was a nice escape from the Austin heat! The description of the listing is accurate and is a good space for 1-2, definitely not 3 though. While the porch area was very cute and looked cozy, when we went to visit it was too hot to enjoy so when we weren't exploring, we stayed inside in the AC. My only negative is that there is a window just above the bed without a curtain. While there is no through traffic and nobody passing by, my fiance and I are scared-y cats and had to put towels over the window to be able to fall asleep. It doesn't help that we also saw a few scary movies playing in the background at Casino El Camino on 6th! Also, if you are the type that likes to sleep in, I would not recommend this place as there are open windows towards the ceiling which let natural light in. 

Pros:
Walking distance from Downtown and great food spots nearby. 
Secluded, homey, feel.
AC!

Cons:
Scary window

Thank you, Jennifer! We felt at home in Austin during our stay."
,,,,,,,,What a great wee find! It's like you're in the middle of the countryside and yet minutes from downtown. Loved this space and would def stay again if in town. Jennifer was fast to respond to queries too. Recommended!
,,,,,,,,"Working with Jen on my trip was very easy from the beginning.  She was quick to return my emails and anticipated many of my questions.  Those questions unique to my visit were handled in a timely and very satisfactory manner.  All subsequent contact was via email and text, and it worked quite well.  Again, she is an attentive and concerned host.

The cottage sits back a little from the street and offers a fairly secluded experience. Although I had read others' reviews touting the serenity of the gardens in evenings, I was so busy seeing and experiencing Austin that I did not spend any time on the porch.

Jen had said that Austin is a bike-able city, and she provided the bike!  I toured the city and explored nearly all I wanted to see via bicycle.  My conference was at the convention center, an easy ten to fifteen minute walk from the cottage.  For those who Uber, Austin can get pretty jammed with traffic and my Uber drivers were very good at by-passing the jams and getting me to my destinations.

Her place is clean, convenient to some of the best attractions (and BBQ!) Austin has to offer.  I highly recommend the cottage for anyone traveling solo or with one other."
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was a great host who keep us up-to-date with our booking. She provided accurate and thorough responses to our enquiries. The cottage was pretty small although big enough for the two of us. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was clean and spacious. Plenty of towels etc provided. We had access to lauundry facilities which was appreciated as we'd just come from a week in New Orleans. We also had access to two pushbikes which was great. The location is great if you are interested in accessing the many bars and clubs on 6th St all within easy walking distance. Excellent food nearby (Buffalina, Veracruz All Natural, Cenote and fabulous coffee at Flat Track - all easy walk). We were in Austin in mid summer and it was pretty hot and humid (low to mid 30s) but the cottage had good air-conditioning although plenty of mosquitoes kept us inside. When we  our flight out to LA was rescheduled Jennifer kindly allowed us to check out late. All in all we had a great stay and we'd recommend Jennifer's place. "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was very welcoming.  We never met her but she sent us messages to check on us regular and make sure we were enjoying our stay.  She also sent us so many tips.  She told us about the weather (unusually rainy) before we arrived so that we could pack accordingly and suggest a swimming hole on a hot day.  You could tell she really cared.  My boyfriend and I went to Austin on vacation and this cottage was very close to many of the popular spots in Austin.  We walked to Rainey St., downtown, West and East 6th street.  The neighborhood was probably my favorite neighborhood in Austin.  It has some of the most delicious restaurants and coolest bars.  Stay Gold was one of my favorite outdoors bars and it was just a few blocks away!  

The place itself was small but lovely.  Once you get inside, you feel like you are in a treehouse because all you can see out the windows are trees.  It felt very peaceful.  The bathroom is also really cute and artistic, you can tell she put a lot of effort into it and it looks beautiful.  It does include a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker.  There is also tons of parking on the street.  Our only complaint was that the internet was a bit spotty, so we used our phones to look most things.  I suspect the router was located in the main house and it was just too far away.  Yet overall, we loved staying here, and Jennifer was just so nice!"
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer's cottage was a great home-base for our 4 night stay in Austin. The space was comfortable, quiet and we appreciated the drinks and snacks she left for us in the fridge. Jennifer was a great host; very easy to reach and responsive to the questions we had while we were there. She also provided some good suggestions on things to do. The location of this cottage is perfect - away from the touristy side of town and close to East 6th street, which quickly become our favorite area in the city. In this area be sure to check out the East Side Fillin' Station food trailers - great selection and atmosphere. Also recommend Cenote for amazing breakfast, and the White Horse bar for drinks, great music and fun dancing. Also, don't go to Austin without a trip to Barton Springs - great place to cool off for a few hours. We would happily stay at this cottage again when we have a chance get back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was quick to communicate and staying at her place was a breeze. Walking to downtown was quick and easy, as well as checking out places in East Austin. I ate every morning at nearby Cenote, so delicious. The bed was very comfy and the shower is absolutely fantastic. I had a great time. "
,,,,,,,,"Had a very lovely stay in the cottage. It was very homely, in a beautiful setting and so close to many great things to do in Austin. Would definitely love to stay again! "
,,,,,,,,Great location! Jennifer was a very gracious host.
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was great, quite, convenient location to food and nightlife, and free street parking because having a car around Austin is vital to see as much as possible.  We were in town for 6 days and having the ability to walk and get breakfast tacos made the experience so much better.  I would recommend this cottage to any of my friends who may be traveling to Austin.  Jennifer was a fantastic hostess, I never saw her the whole time I was there but she checked up on us while we were there and I felt that if I needed anything she would help accommodate.  Overall we had a great time in Austin and had a wonderful time being guests at this quaint easy Austin cottage."
,,,,,,,,"Our experience staying in the cottage was good. In a pretty good location, walkable to some of the bars/restaurants in East Austin. Jennifer was accommodating when our flight was cancelled and let us stay another night on short notice. A great alternative to staying in a hotel!"
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was really friendly and communicative and her place was in a great location. We walked to some music venues on 6th and 7th Streets and there was perfect coffee at Cenote in the morning.
We were in Austin for an unusually rainy four days so we found the house kind of dark. It's probably perfect, though, during hot and sunny weather! I also think the space would be better for one person... it's a bit cramped for two.
Thanks, Jennifer, for your great suggestions. Next time... swimming!"
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were so pleased with this quaint listing. I loved being able to sit in a garden in the early morning and late evening drinking teas that were provided for us. We were close to a delicious breakfast spot called Cenote, which we walked to each morning. At night we were able to walk into town, Rainey Street,  via Holly street or we could two step at the local White Horse right up the road. I didn't get to meet Jennifer, but anytime I sent her a message she contacted me immediately. We would difinately stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"My experience was excellentâ€”Jennifer replied promptly and was very helpful, and the house (shed) was very clean and had all the basics. It was a great place to stay for a few days in Austinâ€”well located, private, quietâ€”and I'd recommend it highly to anybody looking for a pleasant place to stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Exactly what we were looking for! Perfect, secluded place to stay and relax when we weren't walking and biking around the city. Great location, effortless arrival and departure.  We'd stay again!"
,,,,,,,,The cottage was just right for me to escape the craziness of SXSW. I made sure I ended each night on Rainey so I had an easy walk home. Jen made sure I had everything I needed during my stay. This is such a great tiny escape. 
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer called me as soon as I let her know I arrived and was extremely helpful with recommendations in the neighborhood. The cottage was quaint and adorable and the neighborhood was filled with birds singing. The location was awesome- you can walk or ride a bike into downtown Austin plus there are great restaurants, bars and a yoga studio a few blocks away. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice place. Not flawless but certainly comfortable, clean, friendly, private, and definitely a place I'd return to."
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was ideal for my time in Austin.  Simple and quiet, in a wonderful neighborhood, surrounded by a lovely yard.  Would return in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"Although we never met Jennifer in person, she was very quick to respond to our texts. Her directions were very exact so we had no difficulty finding our cottage.
Austin is an up-and-coming city, so rustic accommodations are not so easy to find. The cottage is adorable, with it's own little porch, beautiful tilework in the bathroom and a mini-kitchenette with microwave, coffeemaker, fridge and some dishes and utensils. The bed is reasonably comfortable. There is a bureau to store things but not really a good place to hang clothing.
I walked every day to and from downtown - less than 15 minutes each way but the neighborhood is just a bit dicey.
Jennifer recommended the intimate Buenos Aires Cafe, about 8 blocks away, and we enjoyed it so much that we went there twice."
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer's cottage more than lived up to the photos! It was a really comfortable, relaxing, and unique place to spend a week. The bed and the bedding were extremely comfortable and pleasant. There was more than enough space for my clothes and things, and excellent amenities - a fully functional kitchenette, a coffee maker, and even a stock of food and beverages.

Two space heaters did a fairly effective job at fighting off the near-freezing outside temperatures, but it is a tall building and at times it was rather chilly. I felt comfortable, but those who are less cold-tolerant might need to turn up the heaters more than I did.

The bathroom and shower are gorgeous and extremely functional. I did find that I had to take fairly short showers with the amount of hot water, probably due to the unusually cold weather, but I was trying to conserve water anyway. The provided toiletries were very useful; if I hadn't brought my own, I'd have been fine with what was already there. One essential (TP) did run out, but Jennifer brought a large refill the next day.

The block is very quiet, except for the local wildlife - I heard and saw many species of birds, squirrels, maybe an opossom or raccoon. The neighborhood is GREAT and packed with places to eat, drink, and have fun. (As a Detroiter, I was really happy to see Via 313 Detroit-styl pizza and multiple Founders beers on tap at the Violet Crown nearby.) It's right near the Texas State Cemetery for photographers, close enough to walk downtown, far enough to be quiet, and full of Austin character.

I've stayed several places in Austin in the past, *including* the Driskill, and there's no place I'd rather stay next time than this cottage."
,,,,,,,,"Very cute and quaint in the middle of Austin's best.
Small, as seen in the pictures, and a note that everything that is in the pictures is pictured.  Jennifer did a great job of making it feel like you indeed were in a hotel room, with a stocked kitchenette area, and we were as warm and cozy as imagined.

Thank you Jennifer!"
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer is a good host and on top of things. I was out most of the time and didn't get to meet her, but she made sure I had everything I needed to check in and was on top of her phone, emails and texts. The place itself is quite private and what I would call bare bones, but all the basics are there. It's a great crash pad in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The space was beautiful and within walking distance of several great restaurants. Unfortunately, I was working the whole time and really only got to sleep there. I didn't get to meet Jennifer but she's put together a lovely space "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place to spend the weekend exploring Austin. Very relaxed Zen cottage as described. in quiet part of town but only a short walk into town. Love the people of Austin, friendly and smiling wherever you go. Jennifer was not there but checked in with me twice to make sure everything was OK. Really appreciate that. Hope to come back and explore more of Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed @ the ""Artsy, Zen garden cottage"" for almost a week in October. I found the property to be exactly as described online. Jennifer was responsive, thorough and helpful throughout the whole process from booking to neighborhood tips etc. Initially I was interested to see how it would go sharing the property w/ two other homes w/ full time residents, but it was a non-issue. I loved the neighborhood, it's a little gritty and funky (this was a plus for me) but always felt safe, even walking home late at night.  There is great coffee, food, fresh juice and breakfast tacos within a few blocks. I would absolutely stay again. The one thing that could be improved in my opinion is the bedding. Full disclosure, I like a really cozy bed, that being said a high quality set of sheets and a few more fluffy pillows would seal the deal."
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer was very efficient in relaying messages to me for my arrival. I didn't actually get to meet her, that was fine by me I enjoyed the privacy and tranquility. The studio was perfect for my stay, it is in a fantastic position for easy access to all I wished to do. "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer made arrival quick and easy. Cottage was already cooled (great for summer Austin weather), clean, and ready to go. Location was good for exploring all which ATX has to offer. Overall, a fun, ""very Austin"" place to stay while experiencing this great city."

,,,,,,,,"Gary's house was perfect for our group's needs during SXSW. It's about a 20 minute walk to 6th street and close to neighborhood restaurant and bars so we didn't feel like we were out in the boonies. the house was lovely and perfect for our group of 6 co-workers. I would say if you're travelling with more than 6 it might get too tight though. It was very easy to get into the house, we only needed to enter a code on the door, which was sent to us by the rental company. We loved the front porch and dined outside as often as we could. I would definitely recommend Gary's home to anyone looking to spend time in Austin. "

,,,,,,,,"WOW! What a fantastic home with all of the amenities you would need for the perfect stay. Gary was amazing to work with and he made it easy from set up to clean up. We were even greeted with flowers, wine and homemade treats! 
The location in Austin was literally 7 miles from anywhere you wanted to be. We will be back!
Thanks Gary!"
,,,,,,,,"Magnificent House! Gary was an awesome host, very friendly and knowledgable. The house was so conveniently located so it was a walk to everything!! This house definitely made our stay so much more enjoyable. It was very nice to come back to, and kick back and relax. I would definitely recommend this house to anyone who wants to stay in Austin. It was just so close to everything!! Thank You!!"
,,,,,,,,"This house is amazing! Immaculately clean. Wonderful hospitality. Amazing location- super safe, convenient, close to everything you need! Gary has an amazing house that has everything that you need!"
,,,,,,,,The house is beautiful and has a fantastic location that serves as a great launching pad for the full SXSW experience.  The accommodations and amenities were perfect for the 9 people we had staying in the house. Gary provided us with a wonderful experience and even had a great plate of cookies ready for us upon our arrival.  I would definitely recommend Gary and his house to any one considering a trip to Austin.  
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Gary's house for SXSW and had an amazing time. He was a wonderful host, his home was impeccable, and we could not possibly have been more pleased with the experience. If you're in Austin, you owe it to yourself to stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Gary's house for SXSW, and we could not have had a better time. Gary was a spectacular host, his home was immaculate, and our trip was immensely better for having stayed there. If you're traveling to Austin, you owe it to yourself to stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful, amazing place to stay in Austin. It is very convenient to the airport, plenty of parking, beautifully decorated and very cozy.  A perfect place to stay for a girls weekend.  We would def. recommend this place to anyone wanting a weekend getaway. Thank you Gary for the amazing hospitality!! "
,,,,,,,,"Gary's home was lovely and conveniently located, and he's very accessible for questions and recommendations. We had 10 people and still plenty of space. It was a great stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place for a stay in Austin. Fantastic location, nicely stocked with everything you need, easy parking. Host was very friendly and a quick phone call away. We ended up staying in at the house more than we planned because it was so comfortable and fun. I would recommend this place to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"We LOVED our stay at Gary's house! Besides being very comfortable and beautifully decorated, he left out fresh cut flowers in almost every room and information on the home and how to get around Austin. I don't know the last time I have felt so relaxed- this house was the perfect getaway! We had 5 people, but could have easily had a few more. 

The location was perfect within walking distance of yoga, restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc. I was able to run over to Lady Bird Lake from the house and take a stroll through graffiti park. 

I would recommend to stay at Gary's to anyone looking for some R&R with steps away from all the Austin attractions."
,,,,,,,,"What a great place to stay in Austin!   The house was really cool and the perfect place to serve as our Austin home-base.  Our Host really made the house feel like a five-star hotel with fresh towels, flowers, and matching linens on all the beds â€“ with even little hotel soaps and shampoo bottles in the bathrooms.   The â€œhonor barâ€ was stocked â€“ and we spent more time just hanging at the house than we planned.  We will definitely book here again the next time we come to Austin."
3091862,5,9,10,9,9,10,9,I can't say enough about how incredible our stay was at Rachel's home. The location made for a short walk to zilker park and short cab to Rainey or 6th street. The house is fantastic with plenty of room and a magnificent double porch. She was very easy to work with and even provided amenities upon arrival. I look forward to staying again next year.
,,,,,,,,"Rachel was very accommodating and responsive. We had a wonderful stay and I would recommend this place to others. Nice location, comfortable beds and really cool deck. Thanks, Rachel!"
,,,,,,,,"Rachel's hideaway was a nice homely place on the slope of the creek. It's a 20+ min walk to the river/downtown, which is really nice to get away but be so close. There are tons of instruments lying around, giving the place a really soulful Austin vibe. Murphy beds are fun too!"
,,,,,,,,"Rachel was a gracious host and the house was perfect, clean and with a lot of attention to guests with even the little touches. I would absolutely stay with her again. Great location too!"
,,,,,,,,"Great experience at the Bouldin Hideaway. The house met expectations, and was very comfortable/welcoming. Rachel was communicative and helpful when we had questions. Highly recommend for a trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Rachel was accommodating, friendly and her house was beautiful. It was a great location, quiet, great views and walking distance to ACL, restaurants and downtown. The house was a quirky, cozy space, which was well maintained and clearly cared for. I had a great weekend in Austin and left wanting more. "
,,,,,,,,"Great experience! 

Couldn't have chosen a better place to rent for my friends who came in town for ACL.  The house is a hidden gem - clean, modern and spacious enough to comfortably sleep and house a group of 6. 

Rachel and Kevin were great hosts. They met us on time when we checked-in and promptly answered our texts when we had questions. They were hospitable in every sense of the word - they even had welcoming gifts for us waiting in the fridge! 

Walking distance or a short taxi to downtown and Zilker park. This place is amazing. Highly recommended! "

,,,,,,,,Amber was great to work with.  Very responsive and helpful with local attractions. 
,,,,,,,,"We had 8 guests stay at this house and still had room to spare. The kitchen, bathrooms and living areas all looked to be recently renovated. 

Kitchen - Had a really good amount of equipment and utensils. We found plates, glasses, wine glasses, silverware, pots pans, etc. There was enough for us to cook full meals for 8 people, and room enough at the dining room table for us to all eat together.

Another bonus of this house is the front porch. Perfect for a morning cup of coffee.

Area - The neighborhood is ""up and coming"", but easily walkable to the east end of 6th street, the convention center. Also worth mentioning that along with Franklins being a  block away, there's also a CVS two blocks north. A few blocks south (6th and San Marcos) you'll find a small grocery, cafes and a pizza place. We walked a few pies back to the house.

Parking - We easily fit two cars in the driveway. There's also a gate that can enclose one car.

Host - Very quick to respond. Instructions on location, access and amenities were perfectly accurate.

Other - Wifi was fast. Laundry detergent and dish soap were included. 

Excellent AirBNB house. "

Once we got settled in, Per hooked us up with a list of restaurants and attractions close by, and the steakhouse he recommended (Austin Land & Cattle) was phenomenal, not to mention only a 5 minutes walk away!
We had a great time, and this was a fantastic first experience with Airbnb."
,,,,,,,,Roomy apartment with comfortable furniture and private patio. Walkable to lots of places.
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely wonderful space and location in Austin. 5 grown adults fit comfortably and we were all thrilled to see just how close it was to one of our favorite pre-game restaurants. Colin was so great to communicate with and very flexible with our schedule. He was nice enough to leave directions regarding TV and Wifi for us to use, and made sure to let us know he would be available should we have any issues or questions. We will be staying at another listing of his in a few weeks, and I am even more excited to do so now after a wonderful and successful weekend stay at this location. The artwork in particular caught my eye; I stayed in the room with the twin beds and absolutely adored the paintings of different French monuments. Honestly, just a beautifully decorated apartment with an extremely comfortable and large recliner greeting you as soon as you walk in. The price was perfect and affordable, especially for the size and space. You will not regret a stay with Colin as your host - trust me! Thank you again for having us! "
,,,,,,,,"Colin's place worked out wonderfully for our group! Colin was communicative and we greatly appreciated his flexibility with check-in and check-out times. The location was great, walkable to a number of neighborhoods and downtown Austin. I would definitely stay here again!"

,,,,,,,,"Great stay in a fantastic location!  Eric was very responsive and the home was very clean and comfortable.  Restaurants, bars and grocery stores were all within walking distance.  I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Great side of a duplex. The space was great and the location was outstanding. I will stay here again on next trip to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Eric was very accommodating with our arrival/departure time and was always available via texts to answer questions about the home.  Fantastic historic and walkable neighborhood the local grocery shopping, variety of restaurants including an old school soda fountain at the neighborhood pharmacy.   The home was very clean and provided all the basic amenities.  Kitchen is well stocked with cookware allowing for at home dining and lounging.  A great home away from home experience! "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, excellent location and easy to get rideshares (Fare) to and from.  Place was very clean, quiet, and exactly as described.  Would highly recommend and would stay again if coming to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, just as advertised. Nearby several good restaurants within walking distance. A short cab from downtown entertainment. "
,,,,,,,,"Eric's place was great! Clarksville is a nice neighborhood with a lot of great spots within walking distance. The house was clean, comfortable, and perfect."
,,,,,,,,"Eric's home was every bit as nice as the pictures depicted.  Everything was clean, the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with all dishes, glasses and utensils we needed.  The neighborhood is a delight, within easy walking distance to a grocery and to Enfield drug store(one of the best milkshakes that I have had).  Austin is an incredible city and staying in this home made us feel a part of it.  This is so much better than a hotel.  I come back to Austin to visit every year and I would definitely stay here again.  This was our first experience with Airbnb  and we loved it."
,,,,,,,,"A great apartment perfectly located for ACL. We could easily walk or bus into downtown or the festival. It had access to wholefoods for groceries. The kitchen was fully stocked for cooking. The bedrooms were very comfortable, Great place!!"
,,,,,,,,I have been to Austin numerous times over the last few years for the Austin City Limits Music festival and stayed in a variety of homes and hotels and this by far has been my most favourite.  The home was located in a great neighborhood - walking distance to a supermarket and great cafes and restaurants and a stones throw from downtown.  The place was tidy and clean when we arrived.  The beds were both comfortable and the home perfect for me and my friends.
,,,,,,,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Eric's. His home was very comfortable and is situated in a very charming neighborhood. It was a welcome retreat each day after exploring Austin. Literally, around the corner and a few blocks walk were terrific eateries, a soda fountain, cafe, and a local goods grocery store. If you like to walk, downtown is very doable by foot or bike from his home.
We also took Eric's suggestion and used FARE ( Austin's answer to UBER) and found it a very reliable service.
Eric's correspondence with us was prompt and extremely helpful.
We will certainly look to book with Eric again upon returning to Austin.

"
,,,,,,,,"Appreciated Eric's responsiveness and his thoroughness in answering questions. Stellar location within five minutes' driving time to downtown Austin. Lovely, safe  neighborhood for strolling, as well.  Also appreciated the offstreet parking.   "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location, made it perfect to come and go from the game and the surrounding restaurants we love as a family. The space is perfect - 3 adults fit comfortably and the actual layout is wonderful. Eric is a wonderful host - we had to check in about half an hour earlier due to some time constraints and he made sure we had all the info we needed. The bed was extremely comfortable, which was great after a day of standing in the sun constantly. Loved having the U-Verse so we could watch highlights of other games before finally getting some shut eye. He makes sure you are completely taken care of, from additional blankets and towels to simply having easy access in and out of the house. I would be delighted to stay here again, and perhaps in the near future we will be able to. Thank you Eric for having such a welcoming spirit and allowing us to spend the evening at your lovely house. God bless."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, very comfortable and quiet!"
,,,,,,,,Great overall stay in Austin! The place was the perfect size for the 4 of us. Very clean apartment and nicely updated kitchen and bathroom. It was also a convenient location for being close to downtown but far enough out to not feel like you're in the city. About a 10 minute car ride to the east side of the city. I would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,My friends and I had a great time in Austin and enjoyed staying at this listing.  It was just as described and is in a great location.  There are a few restaurants and even a market that are all within walking distance which was a huge plus.  I would definitely book this listing again!
,,,,,,,,nice!
,,,,,,,,"We so enjoyed our stay at Eric & Chris' place. Even though our visit was for a sad event, the property was exactly as advertised and perfect for our family to stay together for the night.  Our hosts recommended great restaurants close by and we were able to enjoy some excellent meals.  Thank you so much for making our stay welcoming and home-like!  We will definitely stay there again next time we are in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great host, would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great location!  Convenient to everything Austin.  Would've killed to live here when I was a student at UT.
,,,,,,,,"Everything about our stay was great, cleanliness, kitchen supplies,comfort of beds, and furnishings.   Eric and Chris were open and prompt in answering our  questions,  replacing some light bulbs and listening to some observations.  If we return this would be our place of choice."
,,,,,,,,It was the perfect place! The location is great and the house is very well kept with nice amenities. I highly recommend staying here and hope it's available for our next trip to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay! Everything about the stay was easy and well taken care of. It was clean, the neighborhood was quiet and the entry/exit was flawless. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay for a weekend in Austin!  It's really close to downtown, especially all the stuff on Lamar.  We had a great time!"
,,,,,,,,Eric's place was neat and tidy and definitely portrayed the photos on AirBnb correctly. His instructions were check-in were simple and thorough. I never had to call him once because everything was tidy and true to his word! Would stay here again in a heart beat!
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was perfect! The location of our house was great! Close to downtown, and the local restaurant recommendations were so good. Eric was so helpful and easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay again, and I HIGHLY recommend this location!"
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful experience right in the heart of Austin. We brought our French bulldog along and he loved the place as well. It was clean, and close to everything you needed. Would definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"This place was in a prime location! The coffee shop down the street was incredible, we were able to get Taxis to all locations needed, it was fabulous."
,,,,,,,,"Eric provided great instructions for getting to and staying at the house. It was clean and a great location. Highly recommend staying here! 
"
,,,,,,,,"The house was a beautiful set-up that fulfilled our needs perfectly - two bedrooms with ample room, as well as a spacious living room.  Eric supplied us with a list of great options across the city - ranging from those within walking distance to those a bit further away.  The Clarkesville location is a great location that's just a short drive from attractions like Rainey St. and South Congress in East Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"It's a beautiful home, quiet neighborhood, convenient to everywhere. Eric gives us very clear instruction and lots of information around town.  Love the neighborhood coffee shop, grocery and restaurant.  My family and I had tons of fun.  We'll definitely book with Eric again for next time in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Many great things about this place. There were four of us staying here - my boyfriend and me, plus my parents - and the size of the place was just right. It rained a lot the weekend we were here, so we were more homebound than we had planned to be, and we found the apartment to be comfortable for hanging out and spending time in. There's a short walk to some good cafes, and the rides downtown were pretty quick. We also spent some time in South Congress and the drive there from this apartment wasn't far. We had come just when Uber&Lyft quit Austin, but the taxis didn't have a problem finding this place. Eric was agreeable to letting us check in early, and when my stepmom left her clothes hanging in the closet, Eric mailed them to her. What more could you ask for?! All in all, we are eager to plan another getaway together, and this apartment plays a huge role in that. "
,,,,,,,,"My family had a great time at Eric's house.  The neighborhood is beautiful and peaceful. It's very convenient to anything you want to do in Austin. 

Eric was very responsive and acommodating.  The house has everything you need.  It was a great experience.  Thanks Eric!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful place, great location.  Would absolutely book again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a cute cozy duplex in a neighborhood that felt central to everything. The hosts were very easy to contact and were extremely attentive to our needs. They also gave great suggestions for nearby eateries, coffee shops etc. We would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,Eric did a great job of giving us instructions on how to get to his place. He gave us awesome instructions on every thing we needed to know about staying in his listing. The house was clean and so much fun to stay in! The location was great and only a short uber ride to downtown 6th street or Rainey street for a night out on the town!
,,,,,,,,The apartment was great and exactly what we needed! Very clean and everything was perfect! In a very convenient location and so much easier than having to stay at a hotel! Thanks! 
,,,,,,,,"This home was exactly as described, in a great location close to UT and downtown, was peaceful and quiet, and was exceptionally clean and organized upon our arrival."
,,,,,,,,"We had such a great experience at wonderful place! The beds were comfy, the place was impeccably clean, and we really had everything we needed. I didn't have a chance to meet Eric and his wife but I don't think that it's a bad thing because there was nothing I needed to call him for! They were kind enough to let us do an early check in because our flight arrived very early in the morning and being that it's our first time in Austin we didn't know where to go to pass time. It's in such a great location! Literally near everything without the busy city traffic. There's parking if you have a car but if not uber is great and so cheap in Austin. We took uber all over the city every night and it's about $10 from the house to pretty much anywhere in the city. We're definitely going to make a trip back and I plan on staying at wonderful place again!"
,,,,,,,,"Eric's place was wonderful.  It was super clean and had everything we needed for our stay during SXSW.  I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling through Austin, the neighborhood is super cute too!  This place is a gem.  "
,,,,,,,,"Eric was a brilliant host who went out of his way to ensure that our stay was perfect. His hints and tips on where to eat and what to see in the surrounding neighbourhood and Austin as a whole could not have been better. The property was immaculate and very spacious, it was perfect for our trip to SXSW. Its close enough to the city centre whilst still giving you the feeling of living in the quieter outer suburbs. 
I would recommend this property to anyone looking to visit Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Eric and his wife were very responsive and everything was exactly as it was described. Parking was easy and accessible, access to the unit was easy and safe and amenities were plentiful."
,,,,,,,,Eric was responsive and very clear in instructions and everything was exactly as described. Great place
,,,,,,,,"We found the ""Wonderful  Place"" to be very comfortable and welcoming.  Eric was very accommodating and easy to reach and (quickly) responsive to our needs and questions.  The home was what we saw on Airbnb, great location (!), quiet and clean.  I would definitely recommend this wonderful place to my family and friends again.  Thank you."
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was in a great location, minutes from all the action. My friends and I had a great time for my Bachelor Party. The outdoor setting is my favorite part."
,,,,,,,,"It was our first time in Austin and Eric was a fantastic host. We were traveling with my 6 month old daughter and Eric went out of his way to provide us with a Pack n play and high chair. The house was very clean, in a great neighborhood (a few blocks from grocery store and restaurants) as well as convenient to downtown. Some additional highlights: clean and extra towels/sheets, coffee and milk provided was a bonus, new pillows, written directions & recommendations of restaurants, local magazines, easy parking, and quiet. I highly recommend and would definitely return. "
9261455,4.5,9,10,9,10,10,9,Noura's place was excellent.  Super clean and comfortable and in a great location.  The highlight was the shower- super hot and great pressure!  I would highly recommend her place and hope to stay there again the next time I am in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Very close to 6th street and amazing restaurants. All within walking distance. Apartment is super cozy and best for 2-3 people comfortably. Apartment felt more like a home away from home than a hotel. Noura was so easy to communicate with throughout the stay. Would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Place was comfy and clean, just what I expected. I would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"It's a beautiful place, and it's clean and quiet. It's also an easy walk from the JW Marriott, where my conference was held. I would stay again."
,,,,,,,,Host was very nice to us. She let us check out late when there was a problem with the thermostat. It's a very cute place with an awesome location. Would recommend to anyone visiting to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,It was a great neighborhood and the host was very nice and patient with questions. 
,,,,,,,,"My stay at Noura's condo was great. The space was wonderful. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was hot and had fantastic water pressure. The location was perfect for my trip. I really enjoyed being able to walk to and from my conference as well as countless restaurants and bars. Thanks, Noura! "
,,,,,,,,Place was awesome! Super close to everything. Noura was great about communicating everything very efficiently. 
,,,,,,,,Great location in downtown Austin.  
,,,,,,,,"Noura's place was very accommodating, it was very mear to downtown and very easy to move around. She was very accessible to respond with detail all of my questions. It was great!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was perfect!  Our apartment was located in the heart of the city, walking distance from everything.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and our host was great at communicating.  I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, great location and excellent  communication from my host!"
,,,,,,,,The location was excellent and the condo very clean. Noura was easy to communicate with.
,,,,,,,,Great location! Easy walking distance to everything in downtown Austin.  Very easy check in and check out.  Would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,Noura was a great host! If I ever had a question she responded promptly which was great. The location was perfect and next to a lot of great restaurants and places to explore. I would highly recommend staying here. 
,,,,,,,,Noura makes you feel very welcome. Very comfortable home in an amazing location. 
,,,,,,,, Noura made everything  super easy. From getting into the apartment to locking it back up great instructions and a great handbook for left for us. The condo was situated right next to the convention center and a block or two from all the action on six street. It was a great place to stay!!! We would stay again! if there was anything that we needed she was right there to help us. We had a great experience!
,,,,,,,,Had a great few days staying in this apartment. It's in a perfect location for downtown and you can walk everywhere. The check in went smoothly and had great communication with the host. Thanks for having us.
,,,,,,,,"Noura's place is perfectly located, and served our needs very well. She was also very easy to communicate with, and the whole experience went smoothly."
,,,,,,,,"When I read the reviews for Noura's place, I thought it must be too good to be true. I was so wrong! This apartment was great. It is literally across from the convention center, where my conference was. It is also 2 blocks from 6th street and I felt very safe walking to and from, even at 12 midnight. There is a Starbucks across the street, a grocery store 3 blocks away, and a bus took me from the airport almost to her door, for only $1.75. I will absolutely stay here again if I ever need to be in Austin. Thanks so much to Noura and her team for a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and great host! We really enjoyed our trip! 
,,,,,,,,Great location! Close to great restaurants and the lively 6th street scene. Only downfall is parking. Street parking only with up to 3 hours at a time so we had to schedule everything around to making sure we were paid up.
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Noura's condo Septemb(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN). I am a solo male business traveler in town for a conference. The condo is in the center of the city and was much cheaper than any of the area hotels. The condo was clean, the bed is very comfortable and the shower head is one of the best on earth! The kitchen has everything that you would need. There is a large TV and there are several DVDs to choose from or Noura gives you a temporary Netflix login so you can watch on your iPad or hookup your laptop to the TV. Most of all, Noura is VERY responsive and quick to answer any questions. I would stay here if I was a solo traveler or a couple."
,,,,,,,,Very welcome. Easily contactable. 
,,,,,,,, Great place in a perfect location. Noura was quick to respond to any minor questions I had. Would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,Awesome location in walking distance to night life and great restaurants. Noura was very helpful and easy to reach. Would definitely recommend! 
,,,,,,,,The place was great. She was quick to respond and attentive any needs I had. Great place!
,,,,,,,,"Great condo in a great area of town. Communication was simple, and the place was really nice. 4 of us stayed, and it was pretty comfortable. Wifi is iffy because it is the shared condo wifi."
,,,,,,,,This is a perfect place if you're coming in for work or pleasure. You are literally right in the middle of everything! I will be staying here anytime I can! Noura was great with handling questions and made it really easy for me to get in and out. 
,,,,,,,,Noura was very well organized and the entire stay was very pleasant. The apartment is in a great location.
,,,,,,,,This property is ideally located in Downtown Austin. The unit is clean and well appointed and Noura is very nice to deal with. We felt safe and did not find the dwelling to be too noisy but then we were out a lot. The unit is upstairs so it I was happy that my husband and his friend were able to lug my big suitcase upstairs but once settled it was perfect for us.
,,,,,,,,"Noura, was a great host and when I had a question she was right on top of it... I felt as if I was staying at a friends house... I could not have ask for a more prime location. I will be using her place next year when our convention come back into town! A+ rating "
,,,,,,,,I was in town for am event at the convention center and this was literally right across the street. Perfect location for my needs with restaurants all around. Thanks for the great stay.
,,,,,,,,"Great place, well situated for the convention center and 6th street.  Good communication.  Thanks Noura."
,,,,,,,,"Overall just a great spot! Clean, A++ location, easy in and easy out. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Noura was wonderful! We had an amazing stay and our favorite part was the location. The walkability to shops, bars, restaurants and the recreation trails was perfect! We felt like we lived there :) I also especially liked how easy it was to contact Noura if we had questions. She was very kind and helpful!"
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood, parking was easy to use metered spots."
,,,,,,,,"Noura was amazing!! Very personable and communicative. She made us feel very welcome and was right there if I had a question, reminding me that she was there 24/7 for our needs. Very sweet!! "
,,,,,,,,Great!
,,,,,,,,An excellent location right next to the Austin convention center. Getting the keys was super easy and the home is lovely. WiFi is available from the complex but almost unusably slow so maybe plan to use your phone for major browsing et al.
,,,,,,,,Noura was a great host. She provided great instructions for check in/check out and made the whole process easy. The apartment is in a neat building with walking distance to everything.
,,,,,,,,The location was the best part of our stay! It was perfect and we spent most of our time out in the city. For me the overall place was nice but average. I few updates would go a long ways to making this an incredible space. The bathroom was a small let down. I was also a bit frustrated with seeing all the empty parking spaces that were left unused the whole time we were there while we had to pay almost 200$ in parking. Overall it was an ok place in an incredible city!
,,,,,,,,"Great space, very close to all of the bars. We had 4 guests, and the apartment was a bit tight, but it was definitely doable. The city is awesome, and this was a convenient location and allowed most of the city to be very walkable. "
,,,,,,,,Noura was an excellent host. Very fast in all of her responses. The location of the unit could not have been better! I would highly recommend this space!
,,,,,,,,"Nice apartment internal part of the complex.  We enjoyed our stay very much.  Would have been nice to have access to even local broadcast channels on the television, but the wifi was reliable and good signal.  Overall a very nice experience."
,,,,,,,,"First off, this apartment is in an amazing spot. Right in the heart of downtown Austin, only a few minutes away walking distance to 6th street and venues alike. The actual apartment was clean and made me feel like a local. I already know next time I'm in town to check to see if it will be available again. Also note, there is an incredible acai bowl place called Blenders and Bowls - it's so good! Noura was awesome and accommodated all of our needs! "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful place. Noura was very helpful and even allowed me to leave my luggage at her place past the check out time. The apartment was cute, clean, and cool and the location was extremely convenient. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"great location, easy to find and Noura was super accommodating "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, easy access, nice space. Would consider staying here again when in downtown Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Noura has a great home! My friends and I had a blast in Austin and her apartment was in a great location. 

The place was clean and the air worked perfectly. Getting in contact with Noura during your stay will not be an issue. Every question I had was answered quickly! 

The only issue we ran into was finding a parking spot. We ended up having to pay $18 a night. "
,,,,,,,,Noura was an incredible host! She made sure we had everything we needed and we were checked in. The apartment is in an incredible location and we fit four of us in easily. It's exactly as pictured. We were in walking distance of downtown and Rainey street. She even left us a guidebook she made! Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,Great location! The apartment was very clean and the host was very responsive to questions prior to my stay. 
,,,,,,,,Place was fine. Clean. Cleaning to check in wasn't planned until 4pm. Although she text later we could get in early...plans were made. Has is leave right @ 11am. Cleaning lady waiting out on the front steps. Not a place to stay if you are looking for flexibility! 
,,,,,,,,Amazing stay! The location was super convenient - close to 6th and bus stop. My friend was able to get around just busing and walking! Noura was super nice and responsive. Apt was equipped - even had a Brita! Highlight: the bed was super comfortable and soft!! 
,,,,,,,,"Noura's apartment is in a great location and has a homely feel.
Everything worked fine. The building seems popular with young visitors and we only had one instance of late night noise.
That said it felt very safe and was secure.
Check in was straight forward. 
Noura was very accommodating and let us leave our bags when we arrived before our official check in.
There's lots to do around the area and would certainly recommend Noura as a host."
,,,,,,,,"Noura had great communication before/during/after the stay. The apartment was awesome, conveniently located, and the bed was very comfortable. Pretty much all I'm looking for in an Airbnb. The only minor negative was that all the windows open out onto building hallways so  you either get natural light or privacy but not both. "
,,,,,,,,"-Very centrally located but not loud
-Fully stocked with all your needs (cookware, toiletries)
-Great water pressure in the shower
-Easy and clear check in/out instructions
-Binder filled with information about the apt, city, etc.

We were a group o"
,,,,,,,,"Noura was a fantastic host and her home was exactly as described. She was prompt and clear with her communication, I would definitely stay at her place again."
,,,,,,,,This apartment is in a great location downtown and was very convenient for everything we wanted to do during our stay! Noura was accommodating when I let her know we would be arriving in Austin before the check in time and was able to get the place ready so we could check in early! Great place for 2 people to stay!
,,,,,,,,"Noura was great! We had an early flight and she was able to accommodate us. Also she was very quick to reply to questions and gave great tips while staying at her place. The apartment was clean, the bed incredibly comfortable, and the location was the best part. It's a quick walk to Rainey, West 6th, Dirty sixth, and other parts of DT. An uber is super easy to catch as well if you want to venture out a little further to East 6th or South Congress. Starbucks is located right across the street for those early mornings as well. We had a car and had to pay for parking but it wasn't much at all and there was plenty of parking around the apartment if you're ok with a quick 1 or 2 block walk (if not less)."
,,,,,,,,Noura was a good host and easy to coordinate with. The place was nice and located near the places we wanted to go downtown. Solid spot for a small group.
,,,,,,,,"Great location for access to 6th street and around town. Nice, clean place and Noura seemed to be very communicative and willing to help in whatever way she could. "
,,,,,,,,Location of this apartment was perfect. Right next to the convention center and several hotels. You can catch a very convenient bus 1/2 block away to or from the airport. Noura was very helpful and prompt getting back with me to answer questions I had.
,,,,,,,,"Noura is a wonderful host!  I had an extremely last minute trip pop up, less than 12 hours notice.   I completed instant books on two other properties and neither host accepted the booking despite availability of the property.  The property was occupied the night before my arrival and Noura turned the place around super fast to accommodate my schedule.

The property is in a great location!  Neighbors are quiet and literally it's a 5 minute walk to 6th street.  Noura even provides a notebook full of useful information for your stay!  

The property is exactly as pictured and very comfortable.  "
,,,,,,,,"This listing was in the bottom 10% of the 30+ airbnbs I have stayed in internationally.  Good things first: (a) Noura was very sweet, talkative, and friendly via email, although I never met her, and (b) the location is excellent.  There were several problems: (1) air-conditioning didn't work and the apartment was 73-77 degrees, (2) apartment was dirty, with hair all over the carpet and bed, (3) sink and shower drains both clogged with long hair (4) slow wi-fi, (5) I was unsure if the towels and bed sheets were even washed at all, (6) everything seemed cheap, from the toilet paper, to the bed sheets, (7) light switches were unintuitive, and it was unclear how to turn on certain lights, and (8) generally not clean from the bathroom to the couch."
,,,,,,,,Everything was brilliant for our short 1 night stay. Well priced and right in the heart of Austin would defiantly stay again!!
,,,,,,,,"After hearing so many good things about using air B&B I thought I would try for one night of the many nights I was in Austin, Texas. I was there for my sons wedding and first stayed elsewhere. I didnot want to trust an unknown person for my stay during this important time. After the wedding I wanted to show guests around one night  so I booked the first time ever air B&B.  As far as the neighborhood,it was accurate. Unfortunately the place was not so great. The air mattress was not working and deflated. The place was extremely hot and the thermometer read 79 degrees. It was so hot that we turned on the air to find it broken.  There was condensation and the ceiling appeared to be dripping a lot.  I called Noura and she said she would send a maintainece man over. Of course we opened the windows. A WHILE LATER,  she said she was still waiting on his call. She kept asking If I was there.   After that, she said he didnâ€™t call so she would get someone else. After that is was later in the evening and all too conveniently she said that no-one would come out on a Sunday evening and it was not necessary to do something since it should have cooled off by then. I first called her at check in so she had all evening. After this,The air mattress she said her cleaning person bought, deflated during the night and 2 of my guests were uncomfortable and disgusted and left for a hotel. It was strange because a woman kept walking past with one earphone in  throughout the inside the cemented hallways and staring. We had to go outside it was so hot indoors so we noticed this passerby. When we called Noura she said she just had the air conditioner fixed last week. I am skeptical of this and I was offered 50 dollars off. Of course texting her back and forth while I was supposed to be enjoying my family made it awful and it was a very bad experience to be completely honest. I believe the air conditioner probably never worked and the place was definitely not what was advertised. The hassle of communicating all this while I supposed to be enjoying myself was even worse. I would never trust this person . Sorry. This was my first and last airB&B."
,,,,,,,,"Noura was very helpful, the guidebook she left for us was perfect and really helpful. Location was perfect, can walk anywhere you want to go or easily get a taxi from across the road. Very good experience. "
,,,,,,,,"This Airbnb was in the perfect location! Great for getting to 6th St., Rainey St. and even South Congress- we were able to walk everywhere.  The host was very friendly and easy to communicate with and even left us a welcome bowl of candy upon arrival. The cleanliness was not up to my standards and the place was a little shabby, which was the only downside, so we didn't spend a whole lot of time inside. The walls are also paper thin, so you can hear everything the neighbors are doing and if you are a light sleeper like me, you may want to bring earplugs."
,,,,,,,,"Noura was a Great host., was very accommodating and helpful in getting us into a house on Vert short notice., was also very patient with us as we kept getting lost and losing connection over the phone.. She didn't give up on us or get frustrated in anyway. Her apartment was in a Amazing Location!!! And was nice and clean! Thank you so much for the experience! "
,,,,,,,,I booked this Airbnb on behalf of three of my colleagues who were attending SXSW. The location was perfect for what they needed during their visit. Noura was understanding and didn't mind that I was booking on behalf of others. She sent very detailed check-in instructions on the day of check-in (so as not to give out security info before then); and she was very communicative. 
,,,,,,,,"Noura made booking this place a breeze! She was super responsive, always getting back with any details within minutes. The place is exactly as pictured, was in an INSANELY convenient location, and really made visiting Austin such a pleasure.

A couple quick details that were relevant to me:
- Noura manages everything from a distance (not there for check-in or check-out), which could be a selling point for any guests who really want their privacy. 
- Super safe apartment complex with key required at front gate
- Place is spotless! 
- Kitchen is fully stocked with all pots, pans, knives, etc., for cooking. Coffee machine is a Keurig machine, so you'll want to make sure you know where to stock up on the K-cup pods.
- Only windows all overlook hallways in the apartment complex that are in semi-frequent use, so if it's important for you to have big windows open with streaming sunlight, might not be right fit for you.

Really, this was an awesome home base for exploring Austin, and Noura's a great host. Strongly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Noura messaged me soon after I booked the place to say hello. She gave good instructions on what to expect. I was sort of nervous when I didn't get the check in instructions by the morning of the check in day, but once I received the message, I understood that because it requires her giving out codes to her lockbox, that it's best to not hand out that information to strangers too early lol!"
,,,,,,,,"Noura was quite helpful! When I asked for tips on restaurants and bars for our trip, she offered suggestions! 
The listing was walking distance to all the night life we were hoping to visit on our weekend out. Her space was as described and worked perfectly for our crew of four. "
,,,,,,,,"Noura's home was the perfect place for a restful and fun night in Austin. The apartment is within walking distance to the downtown, capital/North Congress and even South Congress areas (if you are interested in getting a good walk in across the bridge) and had everything I needed for a quick overnight in Austin. Noura provided super detailed directions to gain access into the unit which made my arrival and departure super easy. I really enjoyed the cozy environment of the apartment and how easy it was to find everything (towels, pillows, etc.). Thanks for the great stay, Noura!"
,,,,,,,,"Noura was very friendly and was flexible around our arrival and departure times. Location was unbeatable - just steps from the most vibrant parts of Austin. The temperature was a bit difficult to control and shower was a bit dirty, but otherwise a wonderful stay. "
,,,,,,,,Noura was very accommodating.  Her condo was the perfect size and in a great location.  She was fast to respond to all questions.  She was a great pleasure to work with!!!!
,,,,,,,,The location was perfect! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location and place was exactly as described, thanks for a wonderful stay! "
,,,,,,,,"Location, location, location! Noura's spot is conveniently located in the heart of everything. It was my first trip to Austin and my friends who live in the city were impressed by the place. Noura was super responsive and chill. The sleeping arrangements were comfortable, the shower was strong, and the bathroom amenities provided were top notch (picture staying in Vegas). I would highly recommend staying here before it gets booked up. The value and location is prime. "
,,,,,,,,"Noura was a great host, we had a great weekend exploring Austin.  The property was exactly as described and was easily walkable to sixth street and other areas of downtown.  We had people sleeping in the bedroom, on the futon and on the air mattress, and it was perfect for a two night stay.  Noura was easy to communicate with and even left a binder with some information about the area and suggestions on what to do.  If I ever visit Austin again, I would definitely rent here.  Thanks Nora!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was just as described! The location of this rental is perfect. It's cozy and welcoming, and the bed is unbelievably comfortable! Noura is an excellent host!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location!  We basically walked everywhere we wanted to go because how central the location was to campus, SoCo, Rainey St, etc.  The room was comfortable, and really convenient to host our trip.  Noura was easy to communicate with, and even offered some tips on breakfast and dinner for some newbies to Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"Loved the place, very convenient if you want to spend time downtown. Lots of places to eat and go out to. We walked everywhere. The place is very cute and accommodating for a small group or a bigger one, she had air mattresses which were perfect, lots of extra blankets and pillows. The water pressure in the shower was awesome, I  know a little weird, but definately a plus. Honestly this was my first time to use the airbnb and it was definitely a great experience. I will definitely be using this again and hopefully visiting Austin again and will definitely try to get Noura's adorable  place. The only thing that I could suggest is better parking, which I know is kinda hard when it's downtown in such a convenient location."
,,,,,,,,"Noura was awesome!! Great stay, great location, highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment is at an incredible location! Noura was super attentive and responsive. We did not have any issues as far as communication was concerned. Couple of issues with the AC/air mattress- but I am sure Noura would have fixed it by now. Location is the real winner. But the apartment is super cozy and has a well stocked kitchen. We felt really welcome!
,,,,,,,,Nice little apartment just a couple blocks from 6th st. She was a great host and would definitely use her again!
,,,,,,,,"Lovely apartment, great neighborhood in the heart of downtown. Noura was super accommodating, the apartment very comfortable. Great experience.  "
,,,,,,,,Noura was a great host!  I booked kind of last minute and she accommodated me.  She provided ample information about the area and helped me with any questions I had.  Her place is very clean and comfortable to stay in.  The bed is soo comfy!  I really enjoyed my stay and I highly recommend her place.
,,,,,,,,Noura was great host ! I booked her place at last minute and she helped me resolved the parking situation as well. The place is two block away from 6 street that makes it super convenient !
2380176,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,"Peach was a wonderful host! She gave us a tour of her unique house and showed us how to use everything. She also drew us a map of the area, so we knew exactly where everything was. This was an awesome location for ACL! It was only a 10 minute walk to get to the gates at the festival. There was also so many other things to do in walking distance from the house. We loved our stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"Peach is a great host. She is very flexible with her bookings and will work with you to make things easy. 

The location is great for ACL, it takes about 5 minutes or so to walk to the park. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,Peach was a FANTASTIC host!! So thoughtful and warm... really made us feel at home and took care of anything we needed. This place is a GEM!!!!  Such a funky house in a great area with a beautiful little oasis of a backyard.  Loved it.  Hope to be back soon!
,,,,,,,,Peach is so very kind and welcomed me and my colleagues as if we were old friends. She was incredibly meticulous in ensuring we had everything we could possibly need for a comfortable stay. 
,,,,,,,,"I'm so tempted to keep this gem my little secret, but alas... I must share!  We rented Peach's home for ACL 2015.  The location is perfect.  I timed our walk to the entrance of Zilker and it took us 10 mins and 48 seconds, walking leisurely.  The home is charming and is exactly what you'd think of for an older ""classic"" S. Austin home.  We had 6 people and there was plenty of space for everyone.  Peach was even kind enough to let us keep our cars in the driveway on Sunday for a nominal fee even after check out.  Not only is the home in a great location in terms of restaurants on Barton Rd, it is also within walking distance to a ton of different shops and restaurants on S. Lamar.  It seriously was the perfect place and if/when we ever do another 3 day ACL weekend, we will definitely rent from Peach!  "
,,,,,,,,Peach was a great host. She was very responsive to all my questions. The house was clean. Location Was great. 
,,,,,,,,"Peach was the best host ever. And that means something coming from the second best host ever :-) 
We booked this lovely house for our visit to sxsw, with 7 people. Originally planned to be with 6, but Peach did everything to make an extra guest possible. She provided us with a nice (hand drawn!) map of Austin and gave us a lot of tips, also for my private trip after sxsw through Texas. We really felt welcome and at home. Peach checked our preferences before arrival and made sure we had tea, coffee and other stuff to get started.  But what I liked most was the nice conversations we had through e-mail, in anticipation of us coming to sxsw (which was also great btw). 

 The house is simply lovely and so is the neighborhood. In a green, hilly residential area, with excellent restaurants close by. Ube taxis, rental bikes or the city bikes which are available close by, will get you downtown real quick. 
Donâ€™t hesitate and book. But not during sxsw, because then we are coming back â˜º

,,,,,,,,Clay and his roommates Chris and Blake were great hosts. They left the fridge stocked with goodies and tried their best to make our stay in Austin the best it could be. We were there for SXSW and didn't spend too much time in the house.   They offered tips and even a free yoga pass for a studio nearby.  
13345859,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great location, near, but fortunately a block away from the 6th street madness. In walking distance to everything - SoCo and Rainey Street as well as The Capitol and bountiful restaurants. The loft was immaculate, well stocked, very comfortable and sparse, which made it easy for upkeep. The bathroom, while somewhat open, was spacious, had bath sheets (!) and worked for us (a couple.) We enjoyed our stay immensely."
,,,,,,,,The loft is in the most convenient and fun part of downtown. It is very clean and the pictures are entirely accurate. Street noise was not an issue at all. I slept like a baby. Would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Danielle was fantastic! Super amazing host. Met us when we arrived, and stopped by to say goodbye to us as we departed. Apartment was incredibly clean, HUGE, and comfy. Super close/walkable to everything downtown. Has plenty of towels, sheets, pillows, etc. Had a fantastic stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place. Very big. 
It's right in the middle of everything so if you want something more secluded or off the street this might not be the place for you but it was very cool. 
It's a nice area but there are a lot of people on the street and it can get noisy. We didn't mind though! "
,,,,,,,,Location was great - being walking distance to basically everything made the trip so much better. A lot of room but sleeping space limited. 
,,,,,,,,"This condo was fantastic. It has a great vibe with the exposed brick and unique artwork and the location is probably the best in Austin...walkable to almost everything. 

The host was really great. Check-in and check-out was a breeze since the host was there to welcome us and we had toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) provided for us, which was a cool perk. Would definitely stay here again!"

4914582,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,"Enjoyable experience. Marisa was very courteous and helpful, definitely think it was a little overpriced for the apartment and ""cleaning fee"". Paying for the location"
,,,,,,,,"Good size one bedroom in a great location for accessing downtown Austin. There is plenty to do, see, and eat all within walking distance from the apartment.

The apartment was clean with furniture that's in pretty good shape. My colleague who slept on the bed said it slept great. It's only a full-size bed though, so keep that in mind if you are considering sharing it with another person. There is also a comfortable futon and plenty of floor space for an air mattress.

The only downside of the place is parking. Marisa only had a visitor pass available, and there is a limited number of visitor parking. It may be that this rarely fills up, but on the Saturday night that we stayed there it was completely full when we got back from dinner (around 10:00pm). There was also a hot rod festival that was going on there on S. Congress, so that may have contributed to it. Sure enough, after about 20 minutes of waiting a tow truck came and towed one of the cars parked in the visitor spots that did not have a permit. So this can be a huge pain, but I believe Marisa that it rarely happens.

What kept me at a 5 star review was the fact that Marisa was very flexible on us checking in early and leaving late. She also was available by phone whenever we needed her. And she takes the time to leave plenty items that you may need (snacks, body wash & shampoo, toothpaste, Advil, ect.)

Overall, a fairly pleasant experience."
,,,,,,,,"Not only was this apartment everything that the listing claimed, but I felt like I was visiting a friend's home. Marissa left behind snacks that totally fit my taste. Almost eerily fit my taste:)
The location is ideal. It is situated just outside of Congress Street nightlife. The complex was quiet, and it was a short walk to food and entertainment on South Congress. Really the best of both worlds.

I was in town for an event at Austin City Limits, and enjoyed the walk across the Congress St. Bridge, even though the Uber ride was less than $5...

I would stay again. Any. Time.
"
,,,,,,,,"Marisa's apartment was the perfect place for our short visit to Austin. The apartment complex is located just between all the south congress shops and the center of downtown. The apartment was even roomier than expected. Marisa provide us with a welcome gift along with lots of helpful information to make the most of our time. We were able to bike/walk to most of the places we wanted to visit, with the exception of mount bonnelle which was a short uber ride away. I would definitely recommend this apartment. "
,,,,,,,,"Maria has, hands-down, one of the best Airbnbs. 

It's a very nice place right near everything you could possibly want to do in Austin. Not only is downtown a 10 or 15 minute walk, but there are a ton of delicious taco shops, great coffee places, and vintage stores, record shops, and pizza places just around the corner on South Congress. 

Marisa herself is so helpful and friendly -- she had the apartment stocked with snacks and cleaning products, and was always available to answer my questions. 

It's crazy how rare this is on Airbnb, but she's just a normal polite person with a regular adult's home. Why aren't more places like this?! 

I'm glad this one is. "
,,,,,,,,Marisa was very helpful with recommendations on the area. The location was great.  She had wonderful extra amenities that was a great personal touch.
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful stay at Marisa's property! Great location and a spacious apartment. Marisa was extremely helpful through the entire stay, answering any questions I had. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"Marisa was the perfect host, her apartment is in premiere location off South Congress, and the apartment hits the perfect balance of being clean and hotel-like, while remaining homey. If you're planning to use Airbnb in Austin, then stop looking because you won't find a better place or host than this one.

I went to Austin to take the bar exam. Knowing this, Marisa set up a little study area for me, left me some healthy snacks, and even welcomed me with a bottle wine.

The apartment was impeccibly clean, no noise issues (really surprised me given the apartment is right downtown), and Marisa was always available to answer any questions.

Even after my stay concluded, Marisa was a great host. I left my personal journal on a coffee table, and Marisa found and mailed it to me as soon as she found it.

I've stayed in many Airbnb spots, and lived in Austin for several years. You won't find a better host than Marisa, a more lovely apartment, or a better location to enjoy Austin than this."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Marisa's apartment was the most hospitable Airbnb experience I have ever had! It was truly like having my very own home to return to after wandering around Austin. The apartment is conveniently located near lots of eating places/sights and is extremely walkable if you're used to walking in a city. There was only one sight to see that wasn't walking distance (Rainey Street), but the Uber only cost $5 there!! Her home had EVERYTHING you need for an enjoyable stay -- bathroom goods, etc. I accidentally scraped myself one day and was able to easily find a band-aid AKA this listing truly had everything I could possibly need! I recommend staying at Marisa's apartment if you are interesting in eating and drinking you way around Austin's South Congress and downtown areas. "
,,,,,,,,"Marisa was incredibly helpful with recommendations, welcoming and very accommodating. As a girl's weekend trip, we would highly recommend this location as well as Marisa as a host. Home was clean, accessible, spacious and well decorated. Marisa even put in some care package touches that were so thoughtful and generous (ie. extra toiletries, snacks, ice coffee). Marisa was an incredible host and would absolutely recommend as well as book again if we come back to town!"

15050141,4,8,10,9,9,10,8,"After having the opportunity to stay at Brandon's apartment, we found it very pleasant and was exactly what we expected. Brandon was very accommodating and communicated very well when we had questions. If traveling to Austin I would highly recommend booking a weekend trip with. Brandon helped make the trip successful and fun. I will for sure be making a trip back at some point.  "
,,,,,,,,"Brandon did a great job with the communication as I arrived.  Arrangements were clear and timely.

It can be loud as there is quite a bit of nightlife around.  If you are in Austin to party then great.  If you are in Austin on a work trip then this place could be tough."
,,,,,,,,Brandon's place is in an awesome location to do all things Austin! (walking distance from both downtown and SoCo) The apartment itself is very spacious and we were able to comfortably fit 6 with an air mattress in the living room. Brandon checked-in with us right before we got there to make sure we got in and then gave us free-reign for the weekend. We had a great weekend in Austin. Thanks Brandon.
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was very clean and close to everything you would need. Brandon was very kind to us and kept us up to date as the weekend came when we were staying. On the other hand, we were told that we could leave our cars where we parked, but then they got towed so be cautious about that. Also, the pictures do not accurately depict the setup in the apartment, as the living room has no furniture and one bedroom is completely empty. I would make sure that if you are going to stay at this location, that you park your car somewhere else, which will cost you more money, as this is an apartment complex where you will be towed. Also, I would make sure there are enough places to sleep with Brandon, as there is no couch and only 1 bed, air mattresses are available, but if that doesn't suit you, this may not be this best option for you."
,,,,,,,,Traveled to Austin with a crew of 7 for some beer tastings. Brandon was super responsive and accommodating with any questions we had.

Wow, what a great location! Walking distance to Austin downtown and all the famous streets and restaurants, Congress Ave, live music, Barton Springs natural spring pool, you name it!

This was very important to me, since I had a busy schedule.  

Doug was very helpful with giving me all kinds of tips about transportation and places to visit I asked about. I even mentioned in an email I was curious about local beer and right the next day there was a pack of special beer left at the doorstep for me to try. That was very kind.

It looks like I'll be in Austin again in couple of months and there's no question I'll stay in Doug's flat again, as long as it's available."

He had a fantastic cleaning lady that came by every few days to tidy up. Communicating was easy with the host, if we ever need something (such as plastic bags, curtains put up)all we did was message him and he would get the job done fast. Loved the easy pinpad to get in the property.  Wifi is super fast. You know you had a great stay when you don't want to leave-- even though your new house is only 20 minutes away! "

The location of this place is Great!! Walking distance to downtown and to walk trail. We were impressed on how green Austin is, this place is located on the south side of Austin which is even greener, we could hear birds in the morning.

,,,,,,,,"Ian is highly responsive and extremely helpful with everything. The place is bigger than it looks on the pics and is as described. Thanks a lot, Ian, it had been a lovely stay!"
,,,,,,,,Gave all of the necessary information to access the apartment and information regarding parking.  Neighborhood reasonably quiet and location excellent.  Lots of good restaurants near by.  Needs to include pictures of the stairs which allow access to the small loft sleeping area.  That would dissuade individuals with physical issues from renting and then being faced with problems. Potential renter also need to know that the 3rd floor apartment does not have elevator access.
,,,,,,,,As a first time visitor to Austin I appreciated Ian being willing to answer my questions quickly accurately.  He is a  friendly person and accommodating but not overly so.
,,,,,,,,He was very nice. 
,,,,,,,,Ian was helpfull and Attentive host in all aspekts. Location is best we could imagine. Well done Ian.
,,,,,,,,Ian was extremely communicative. He was always just a text away and was very flexible with everything. The location was right in downtown and was very convenient for meetings and going about town.
,,,,,,,,Staying with Ian turned out to be a fantastic experience.  He was extremely friendly and made my friends and I feel more than welcome at his place.  Everything was clean and orderly when we arrived and the air conditioning was on full blast.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity.  
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location, easy to communicate and access property. Exactly as described. This was ideal for my visit to the convention center. I would definitely stay with Ian again. "
,,,,,,,,Ian was great ! Walking distance to downtown. I found a good close parking ! Comfy bed- and pillows ! 
,,,,,,,,Great experience. 
,,,,,,,,"Ian was a wonderful host. He was responsive and worked with my rather hectic schedule. He's very personable and welcoming, and his place is in a hard-to-beat location. High marks all around."
,,,,,,,,Ian was an ideal host. The place and location are exactly as advertised and he answered any questions I had promptly. There's no question that I would stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,"Ian was responsive and helpful with the details of our stay. The space was conveniently located and clean. The only ""hiccup"" was that we thought we would be staying alone in the apartment (entirely private) from previous conversation and that was not the case. Otherwise, very friendly and accommodating.  "
,,,,,,,,Ian was a great host. It was my first time using Airbnb and he answered all questions before and during the trip which was really helpful. The place was great and exactly as advertised.
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay and host was very accommodating with a last minute reservation! Excellent location and very easy to get to! 
,,,,,,,,"If you're staying for an event at the convention center or need a place to stay that's in the center of everything, this is the place. Hands down. Extremely convenient and comfortable location for my weekend at the convention center. It seemed as though I was just around the block from everywhere! For a first foray into Airbnb it was an incredibly refreshing and positive experience. I will definitely be staying there next year if they will have me!"
,,,,,,,,"Ian was very responsive and helpful before and during my stay, providing information and answering questions.  Very accommodating.  The room is exactly as advertised.  Comfortable.  Perfect location!"
,,,,,,,,Ian was a wonderful and accommodating host. It was my first time using Airbnb and he made the process very simple with quick responses. The location is perfect and one can easily walk to many downtown destinations. I'd highly recommend him to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,We had a perfect stay in the best part of the town.
,,,,,,,,Ian was extremely helpful and friendly and made everything easy. He was very easy going about each aspect of the process. The neighborhood and space were exactly as advertised. I would highly recommend him.
,,,,,,,,"Ian is a great host!  He was quick and responsive when we were looking for a place at the last minute.  The location is amazing - easy walk to 6th street and basically anything you could possibly need.  He got major props when we discovered that he had a blow dryer and little bottles of supplies in the bathroom, just in case we needed it.  I will definitely look Ian up again when I'm back in town!"
,,,,,,,,"Ian came through for me in a pinch when a previous host became unavailable, and it was a great option. Central to downtown Austin (I stayed during SXSW), it's a very welcoming space. The loft where guests stay is spacious and thoughtfully furnished (I slept very well!). Because it's a loft there isn't much privacy from the rest of the living space, but Ian was very accommodating while I stayed, and I never felt like an intrusion. He's available and responsive and makes every effort to make sure his guests are well taken care of!"
12129834,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Such a wonderful experience. The apartment was very nice, comfortable, and the location is key. Bree was more than helpful with questions about the area and even provided us with champagne to celebrate our engagement! Will definitely be back. "
,,,,,,,,"The communication with the host was excellent.  She answered my questions and concerns very quickly.  The apartment complex was new, nice and very secure.  "
,,,,,,,,They went above and beyond to make us feel welcome! Hands down the best Airbnb experience we have ever had!! We definitely plan on staying here again next time we need a place to stay in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Corazon Apartments for our anniversary weekend. The hosts were incredibly helpful and communicative, in the weeks leading up to and throughout our stay. We felt like we had our own personal concierge -- we were emailed a list of fun things to do in the area, help was available via text message 24/7 for any questions or suggestions, and we were even asked if we wanted drinks/snacks to have stocked at the apartment before we arrived (they even got us a bottle of champagne for our special occasion, which was a very thoughtful touch). The apartment  itself was clean, cute (loved the record player!), and comfortable, but I would note that the airbnb photos are of a similar apartment but not the exact same (particularly kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom photos are different). The apartment complex was great; super clean gym and the pool were both on the same floor as our apartment, as well as an accessible rooftop. Across the street from the complex is a great coffee shop and around there is a small bodega/grocery store around the corner. The East Austin area (where the apt is located) had bars and restaurants within walking distance, but wasn't too crowded, which we liked - and nothing was further than a 10 min drive away. Really great location. Overall, we had a perfect weekend and would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends."
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay. Dylan is suuuuuper accommodating. Hotel-like, yet homey. "
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,We adored this apartment. It was beautifully and comfortably decorated. Our hosts were very responsive and attentive before and during our stay. Checking in was seamless. The pool was delightful and the area couldn't have been hipper! We just adored East Austin and this location. There are lots of adorable bars and taco trucks nearby. Just loved everything about our stay and about this apartment. Thanks for everything Bree!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic stay. Austin is great, the location of the apartment is great, the place itself great. Enjoyed the 4 days tremendously.  "
,,,,,,,, The host made us feel very welcome and gave us lots of great tips. They were very attentive to all of our needs. We really enjoyed ourselves. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place, good location and great service."
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood was great and close to the office. The apartment itself had everything I needed to make it feel like home for the few days I was in town. Check-In was easy since everything had a key code on in it I was able to get settled easily. 
5630279,4.5,9,10,10,10,9,9,Sweet little co-work space in the heart of Austins downtown area. Lot of good bars nearby and footsteps from all of the major conference hotels. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,Great location and it's exactly as described. 
,,,,,,,,"Great affordable place to stay if you want to be in downtown Austin!
Host is very responsive and helpful.
"
,,,,,,,,How did your host make you feel welcome? Was the listing description accurate? What was the neighborhood like?
,,,,,,,,This loft was fun and so functional. A great location with responsive hosts. I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location at an affordable location for downtown Austin. Lindsey/Sean were great. Highly Recommend!
"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice common areas and . Has a makeshift set up so walls are very think so you can hear everything but  I think the listing was upfront about that. Overall happy I stayed there."
,,,,,,,,Was really happy with how easy it was to manage my stay. Great spot. Centrally located. Would stay again
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location close to convention center, restaurants, etc... Great amenities and overall perfectly described. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying here during my birthday weekend was a phenomenal experience. The location to 6th street couldn't have been better. I loved the community aspect of the SWAP loft as I met others staying at the loft for the film festival nearby. It was also private enough in that I had my own room. I highly recommend staying here, and would book this location again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"Although I didn't get to meet them in person, Lindsey and Sean were great hosts. They communicated clearly and made sure I knew everything I needed to in order to have a great time. Everything was as described, and overall, it was a great experience. I will definitely look them up next time I am in ATX!"
,,,,,,,,"Overall, it was nice being within walking distance to key areas. The community setting wasn't a problem at all; we ended up meeting and chatting with some awesome people. :)

Getting the key was super easy. The process was efficient and was located very close to the loft. 

Some things that we weren't expecting was parking convenience. We weren't able to actually park at the loft, but we found a 24-hr parking garage across the street for $24 a day.  (We were offered some other options by our host but ultimately we needed our car near us.)

That being said, we'd come back next time we're in town. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to explore Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Die Lage ist perfekt! Wir hatten zwei NÃ¤chte gebucht. Am ersten Tag waren wir alleine in der Loft. Am zweiten Tag hatte es weitere Mitbewohner, welche aber Ã¤usserst angenehm waren. Unterkunft ist absolut zu empfehlen. Insbesondere das Privatzimmer, wenn man etwas mehr PrivatsphÃ¤re mÃ¶chte. Auch die Kommunikation zum Gastgeber hat bestens funktioniert. Absolut empfehlenswert. Herzlichen Dank"
,,,,,,,,"This space was not accurately described on the host's listing page.  The private room is a windowless room with no ventilation with a recently constructed loft with two sleeping spaces right above it- with no soundproofing.  It is not possible to lock the room from the outside when you're out.  Although the shower is separate from the toilet and sinks, it does not have an enclosed ceiling. This means that when anyone takes a shower, it feels like you're in the shower with them.  In addition to the two sleeping spaces up in the loft, there is also a row of 3 or 4 sleeping spaces that each have a bunk bed. These sleeping spaces are not enclosed on the top and are separated from the hallway by curtains.  Privacy is at a minimum here. "
,,,,,,,,Pretty cool place. At first i was a little surprised that the room doesnt have lock and may not be safe for my belonging but it turns out fine. People seems nice. Great location!
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location, and just what we were looking for in terms of a clean/convenient place to catch some sleep between adventures in Austin. Great communication throughout the process. Would definitely look at booking this again when we come back for a show at Kingdom."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in downtown Austin.  Lodging about as close to sixth street as you're going to get at a fraction of the cost of a nearby hotel.  Would recommend and plan to stay here again should I find myself in downtown Austin again.  
,,,,,,,,na
,,,,,,,,"Great host, easy to communicate. Perfect spot, clean and cool, multiple bars/restaurants close by "
,,,,,,,,Fantastic spot right in downtown Austin. Loved the open plan design!
,,,,,,,,This was a good place right in the middle of the downtown area. It was clean and with a lot of working space. Would stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location in Austin, a street away from 6th Street and a block from the Austin Convention Center. 
Shared the location with other people, which was fun. 
Host was on vacation during my stay, but always responded on the same day. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a last minute reservation for me since my previous host cancelled last minute.  Communication was great!  Everything I needed was provided before I checked in after my flight.

This was my first experience in staying in a hostel/shared living space on a trip.  I'm happy this location was my first experience for that.  The room I rented was private and I could lock it while sleeping.  It was the only private room among three other spaces that had curtains so I made a good choice so I could sleep in after traveling around all day.  

Food was available although I didn't indulge. Clean towels were provided.  The bathroom is shared up to 6 people however the guests were all respectful of the other so I wasn't uncomfortable.

I met Sean while here and I felt welcome.   The other guests were all welcoming as well and my first night there, I ended up making new friends and having an amazing time up till my last day!  Every day, there was someone new to meet and hang out with.  I left with great memories and this experience has opened my eyes in the most awesome way.  It was definitely impacted how I will choose an airbnb next time with choosing another shared living space when I travel alone.

Thank you so much for the experience and hosting me!"
,,,,,,,,"It was a great experience, the place was amazing and I had a lot of fun meeting the other people in the house.
Lindsey was super nice and she was very helpful with whatever we needed.
The room was great and comfortable, and the house was very close to everything that I needed. 
Internet was great, bathroom great, living room great. Overall I would rate this 5/5.

Thank you Lindsey and Sean for this great experience."
,,,,,,,,"Inspiration Austin is a single unit that has been converted into a communal living space.  It has one private bedroom with a door and three semi-private bedrooms without doors.

The space is very clean and inviting.  The bathroom toilet had some trouble with the flush handle, but Sean said a new part was on order for the repair.

Getting access to the unit was easy through their Key Cafe locker at a local business nearby and the location can't be beat.  It is right in the middle of downtown Austin with all of the bars, restaurants and shopping within walking distance.

Sean was very helpful and friendly.  I would definitely stay here again as a great budget option in a prime location."
,,,,,,,,"Had a great time in Austin. The location couldn't have been better. The house is big, the room was great. The common spaces could have been be a bit cleaner but overall it wasn't a big deal. Would recommend for a short stay."
,,,,,,,,Wonderful experience as usual!  I have stayed at Lindsey's place multiple times and have reservations for next week!  Looking forward to meeting new people and experiencing more of downtown Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Everything has been awesome both of my stays!  Sean and Lindsey went the extra mile at every curve that came my way and made everything work out beautifully!  The loft is awesome, people I encountered here were friendly and you can't beat the location!  Everything was perfect and am looking forward to next month for another stay!"
,,,,,,,,"SWAP Austin was a great find! Super laid-back, chill, friendly and clean. Would recommend!! Comfortable bed and homey amenitiesâ€”including Clif bars, coffee and tea. All of us loft-mates went out for dinner one night and we had a great timeâ€”felt like old friends. Thanks Lindsey and Sean for a sweet stay in Austin!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, off the noisy part of 6th, but still very close to everything downtown. Small hiccup with my key, and Lindsey responded and handled right away, kudos to her. VERY comfortable bed. The loft is cute how they have it set up. And having a free anack to grab when you don't have time to grab a full meal somewhere is a huge perk. Only downfall - I wasn't aware how my ""private"" room had four walls, but it was like plywood built with the shared rooms literally right at the door. Privacy wasn't an issue but the girl drunkenly crying until 4am sure was. I had an important school meeting the next morning. If you're here for an important early meeting, think twice bc of noise. Other than that, clean, towels and everything provided, both very nice girls. I'd stay here again if I didn't have a morning meeting :) They were responsive, solved issues quickly, and have a nice, clean place with some snacks. Hard to beat."
,,,,,,,,I visited Austin with my girlfriend and we had a great time staying in Lindsey's loft. The bedroom was clean and spacious and had a really big closet for all the luggage. The loft itself was very cool and the living room areas were very comfortable. We even met some really nice people that we hung out with and overall we had a great experience. The loft is also right in the middle of downtown which made it easier to explore Austin.
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in Austin and meet new people!
,,,,,,,,"The location is great - central to many things and easy to walk to dinner or bars. The instructions are very good and communication with the hosts is quick. This is really a hostel (definitely not at low hostel prices), with no locking doors. And most of the rooms only have curtains, not even a door. If you know that upfront, it will set your expectations more realistically. Luckily everyone was very quiet and respectful, so it was a good experience for me. The room I had was really comfortable, with a huge closet. I brought my own padlock to lock up my laptop when I walked around outside. The kitchen is fabulous, with snacks like coffee, almonds, granola and granola bars stocked. Be aware you need to pick up the key via a service called Key Cafe, which requires you to set up an account beforehand. However, Lindsay was gracious enough to set me up with a key in a locked box out front which was really great! "
,,,,,,,,"Kaela was incredibly welcoming. She made sure we didn't have any problems upon arrival and was always generous with her advice when she was around for her normal duties at the loft.

The location is PERFECT, it makes up for any and all other shortcomings. You can't be any closer to the action for any less money I assure you.

The description was fairly accurate, I would say it's a little less private than we expected, but we adjusted pretty quickly and actually really enjoyed meeting all of the other travelers who were coming through.
"
,,,,,,,,"Lindsay we very attentive when I arrived and she went out of her way to show up at the loft and show me around. I think her listing description was very accurate. You obviously need to be comfortable staying in a shared space with others to enjoy the loft, however the room I had was large, had a walk in closet and a desk. It was slightly stuffy as it lacked circulation. 

Very close to downtown, river, 6th st, and a 4-5 minute walk to Rainey st. I couldn't have picked a better location in Austin to be honest. 

I was busy with a conference and didn't have much time to chat with the other guests, but they seems pretty cool and I think Lindsey has an effective vetting process.  "
,,,,,,,,"The instructions are very clear and cover quite everything. Kaela, the contact person, answers quickly.

The loft is clean, well decorated, nice, and very well located. The other people are polite that I could meet were nice and polite.

Afterwards, I found he description very succinct and could be more complete, but it's clean and nice, the bed is good enough. There are two little minus:
- the walls are wooden and badly soundproofed, as consequence, the place is noisy, even if people are careful. Earplugs are then really useful.
- the room doesn't have any window and very dark.

All in all, it's a good quality/price ratio."
,,,,,,,,"I loved being in the centre of town, everything was within walking distance.  Kaela was a brilliant host, one night she invited me to drinks with her friends and we had a great time on the Speakeasy rooftop bar.    The room was ideal, I think I met about 20 new people in a week through everyone staying at the same time - awesome fun! Will definitely be back."
,,,,,,,,First time in Austin and this was the perfect spot to hang out for a few days. The hosts made me feel very welcome. Place was clean and the room I stayed in was very spacious. Fellow people staying at the location were also polite and I didn't have any problems with noise or interactions. I highly recommend it! 
,,,,,,,,"Lindsey and Kaela were the best hosts I could have asked for during my summer in Austin. They were so accommodating, from figuring out my rooming situation to stocking the fridge with some food staples to enjoying fun nights out in Austin with the everyone in the hostel. The place itself was great - right at the heart of downtown. The kitchen was pretty and new, the bathroom was always clean, and the desks were so helpful to get work done. The red room was nice and quiet. I would recommend setting an alarm even if you plan to sleep in a bit; the lack of natural light makes the room a cozy cave. Everything about my stay was so perfect! Thank you Lindsey and Kaela!"
,,,,,,,,Lindsey was a great host! Everything regarding checking in and out was explained well and easy to manage. The room was clean and convenient. The other people staying in the house at the time made the experience even more enjoyable! They were all super warm and welcoming. 
,,,,,,,,"Kaela, who was my contact person for this listing, was friendly and very helpful and flexible with check in and check out times. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, but the loft is loud. The room shares a wall with the bathroom and every time someone took a shower, it woke me up. Also, there are no windows in the room, so it's very dark at night/in the morning with the lights off- this actually helped me sleep in though, which was great. 

When I was there, there were a handful of other occupants at the loft, and everyone was on the whole very polite and nice. The only issue, besides the noise of the shower, was that the thermostat was somewhat on the fritz, so it got a bit warm at night. It wasn't too much of a problem, but those particularly sensitive to heat may wish to inquire about it."
,,,,,,,,"I've never seen anything like this! Great facility with wonderful people sharing this community space;) The single room I stayed in was comfortable yet too closed off with no window or air circulation at all. There is still very strong paint/furniture smell in the room so after a night of sleep inside with closed door, I woke with a headache. Other than that, unique experience! "
,,,,,,,,"This place is great. It's situation about a mile maybe less from everything you may want to do. This hostile isn't large its small with maybe 6 beds and has an urban warehouse feel with just enough touch of home. Lindsey, the host is great to interact with an is available to give an insight you may need about what to do. I loved staying here!"
,,,,,,,,Lindsey was a fantastic host. She is very easy-going and accommodating. The other house guests were very friendly and outgoing as well which made for a very stress-free getaway. The house was well-kept and a perfect distance to all the local hot-spots. We will definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"I had I great time at my airbnb accommodation in Austin. Lindsey is an excellent host and I'd thoroughly recommend staying at this accommodation. It's clean, comfortable and very centrally located. Lindsey is very charming and gave me several recommendations on where to go and what to see. I will certainly try and stay there the next time I visit Austin."
,,,,,,,,Lindsey created a wonderful community loft experience which is an unparalleled place from which to visit Austin. She was lovely to work with and clearly has a great commitment to her guests. I highly recommend staying here if your travels take you to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Austin was not what we were expecting as we were looking for something a little more private. However, since it is a new space I am sure the kinks we will be worked out soon. Lindsey responded quickly and gave us a partial refund. I don't expect her to do that every time but it was nice that she accommodated to our situation. 
The space is much more of an upscale hostel, where guests are encouraged to interact within this community space. You won't have much privacy but you might be the type that doesn't care. The location is great for younger people wanting to experience downtown and 6th street for an affordable rate compared to the expensive downtown hotels.  Altogether, Lindsey is a good host that will take care of you. Just don't expect your own condo type of experience. "
5591462,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Great location!!! Sarah was a great host and answered all of our questions. 
,,,,,,,,"Communication was good 
Great location with bars and restaurants right down stairs
"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's place was clean, smelled amazing and had great amenities.  Four of us stayed there for a wedding, so two in the pull out couch and two in the queen bed. The queen bed was super comfortable and the pull out was probably the most comfortable pull out that I have slept on. The sheets were easy to find and clean. We used the pool one day, which was well maintained and had a grill. You really could not ask for a better neighborhood. A 2 minute walk to the Rainey Street bars and restaurants. There was a grocery store just down the block that had all the essentials. Overall, we had a great experience and Sarah was very accommodating and responsive to my questions. "
,,,,,,,,Sarah's place was great! It was a great location for the right price. We had no issues at all and I would stay there again for sure. 
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was an amazing host and the location and property we equally great!!!  The apartment was very close to all of the action on Rainey St. but far enough away to avoid the noise, I could not imagine a better place to stay in Austin!!!  The property was clean and communication with Sarah throughout the entire process was exceptional, I would recommend this property to anyone traveling to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was an excellent host and her place was beautiful!!! It looks exactly like the pictures and was impeccably clean. The location was amazing as well...right on Rainey, just steps away from great bars and restaurants. She took a lot of care to prepare for three guests, providing extra blankets and pillows. Overall, a great place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah is not only an exceptional host but her place is insanely gorgeous! So much so that I wish I could permanently rent out her place a few weekends per month :) This is the second time I stay at Sarah's and her apartment is always neat, and extra clean, which I really appreciate. And then those VIEWS outside her windows are to-die-for. I really can't stress it enough. The location is ideal for someone who appreciates nature since you're on the lake and there are bikes for rental downstairs, but it also perfect for a girls' trip (tops three people) since you're right on Rainey Street, which is known for its bars and restaurants -- a perfect experience for a Saturday night out or Sunday morning brunch! "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah has a beautiful apartment with a gorgeous view of the river in Austin. Rainy street is a great little pocket of bars a restuarants while still being close enough to the rest of the action near sixth street/downtown.  

Even though Sarah was out of town when we arrived, she made it super easy for us to get into the building and was very attentive to any questions we had via texting.

We loved her place and would for sure stay again when visiting Austin!

,,,,,,,,Great location near 6th street but still far enough away so you can relax and sleep in a nice place. Mark responds quickly to texts and messages in the app. I'd definitely stay at his place again. 
,,,,,,,,Another comfortable stay! I appreciate Mark's quick response to troubleshooting any issues.
,,,,,,,,Marks place was perfect for a downtown night on the town.   Clean and comfy and surprisingly quiet for a downtown location
,,,,,,,,Mark was a great host and easy to reach for all of our questions. Great location. Perfect for exploring downtown. Very walkable to most of the things we wanted to do in Austin. Would definitely  recommend to others.

,,,,,,,,Really nice location and Mark was very helpful with everything. 
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was great. Very clean and the bed was super comfortable!
But the best part of it all was that once I arrived and parked my truck, I never needed it again. Everything is in walking distance. Even my meeting I was there for, was in walking distance.
The location you just can't beat! You can't get any closer to all the night life!! "
,,,,,,,,"I found this place when I decided to attend a conference at the last minute and there were no rooms left at the suggested hotel. I am happy to say, my procrastination paid off!  Not only was this place much less expensive than the hotel - it was only a 1/2 block away from the conference center and soooo much better than staying in a hotel! It was quiet, clean and perfectly located. Mark was a great host and made everything a breeze. If you are attending a conference - do yourself a favor and stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place is in a great location! Walkable to both 6th St and Rainey St areas. A little farther but also able to walk to campus and the capitol. 

We had a great time. "
,,,,,,,,"Mark was easily reachable, his place was very clean, and it was conveniently located near 6th Street bars and restaurants.  I would recommend this place to anyone that is interested in being walking distance to many popular downtown Austin spots.    "
,,,,,,,,"If you're going to the convention center, the location is perfect, literally a few steps across the street. The apartment is nicely furnished. The kitchen is adequate."
,,,,,,,,Great location downtown next to the convention center and a few blocks from 6th street.  Perfect.
,,,,,,,,We had a great weekend at Mark's place in Austin.  The flat is in a great location. It's well appointed and has everything you could need in a weekend getaway. The communication with Mark was excellent and it was the easiest check in and out of any Airbnb I've eve stayed in. We would definitely stay here again!!
,,,,,,,,"Everything was as it was described. Great location, great apartment, great safe surrounding area- loved my 4 nights in Austin. Why pay for a high priced hotel, when you have all of what Mark's place has to offer and the 4K tv- was pretty cool! "
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood, just steps away from 6th street. Gated assigned parking was a huge plus! Very comfortable stay, and would definitely stay again next time in Austin."
,,,,,,,,This was a very enjoyable experience and a great location for downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place is in the perfect location. Very close to 6th street, Rainey street, and all the local attractions. Mark was very flexible and accommodating. His place is extremely spacious and very nice. Would highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"The location is fantastic, this is the perfect spot to explore Austin scene"
,,,,,,,,"Clear helpful communication. tastefully decorated, apartment in a GREAT location.  What more could you ask for?"
,,,,,,,,"Hey y'all!!  
This is a GREAT location to 6th Street, the Convention Center, Rainey St, many great restaurants and even on the same block as the Airport Bus stop!! 
Mark always responded quickly (by e-mail/text) and was very friendly (even though we never met him).
Everything looked/was as expected from the pictures in the listing.
The added bonus of not having to worry about keys was also a PLUS.  (Keyless door entry/lock system.)
I would DEF recommend this location/condo to anyone wanting to stay in Austin for fun and/or work and will be looking for this listing the next time I am in Austin!!  
~Thank you, Mark!!!  :-)"
,,,,,,,,"Mark was extremely accommodating and responsive to any questions we had. The apartment was in prime location within walking distance to many bars and restaurants. He made us feel welcomed and was very informative, which we really appreciated, and helped make our stay enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,Mark was extremely helpful and has a nice little place to stay in.  Everything was clean and well organized.  When I had a little hiccup getting into the front gate Mark was available in rush hour traffic to help.  Thanks Mark
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was in a PERFECT location for my vacation in Austin.  It was so clean and spacious. Mark was incredibly easy to communicate with. I asked Mark for some suggestions on places to live in Austin, he went above and beyond with his advice. My stay in Austin could not of been any better. Thank you, Mark!"
,,,,,,,,"If you're coming to Austin for an event at the convention center, you couldn't ask for a more ideal location. Easy check-in and check-out, a reserved parking space, and you can't get any closer to the convention center. It's also an easy walk to the river where I did a nice evening jog and watched the bats at the Congress St. bridge."
,,,,,,,,Mark's place is in the perfect location to get around by foot in downtown. It's literally right across the street from bus stop. It's super clean and nice! The bed is so comfy. It's on the back side of the building so no busy street noise. We slept like babies. I really loved the cool ac after that Texas heat. Thanks so much Mark!
,,,,,,,,Great location and great place to stay for business or leisure.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was as-described and conveniently located in the downtown area of Austin. It was clean, immaculate and in great condition. Mark was very helpful and responsive with communication. He was very quick to provide any item that I may have needed. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host and very responsive.  We had to get something mailed overnight and he came over that morning just so we could get a mail key from him.  

Location is right in the center of downtown, which was perfect for us.

We had a great experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to crash while in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Mark is one of the best hosts I've ever stayed with -- he is incredibly accommodating, responds with lightning speed, and has a great space.  His condo is also extremely well-appointed and in a very convenient part of town.  The experience could not have been better and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place is superbly located in the heart of downtown Austin which made getting around an absolute breeze. The apartment is clean and spacious and we felt at home as soon as we arrived. If you're planning a trip to Austin and this place is available, get it. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and condition
,,,,,,,,"Very nice place. Our stay couldn't have gone smoother. The condo is very neat, clean and fantastic location. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was great, perfect location for a weekend in Austin.  Didn't end up using any public transit as everything was so walkable. 

Place was great, exactly as described, and very easy to get in and out of.  Worst part of Airbnb can be a clumsy key exchange, but not a problem at all with Mark's setup."
,,,,,,,,"Everything as described, excellent location.  Would definitely book again!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience at Mark's AirBnB and it was perfect for our weekend. Nice place and fantastic location.
,,,,,,,,"Mark was wonderful. Excellent communication, great location, and he was very accommodating. Thanks for a great time!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent host with an excellent apartment in an excellent location of Austin. While I never met Mark during our stay, he did a tremendous job of providing a high level of hospitality as he was very accessible and provided thorough information related to the check-in process and the surrounding area. While the apartment only has one bed, we were able to comfortably sleep three grown men with the air mattresses and there's plenty of space to accommodate virtually all needs during your stay. While the lights in the living room kept it from being overly bright, it is the perfect set-up for relaxing with a very comfortable couch and  to go with a great TV and surround sound. Everything that was listed under the amenities was absolutely provided and it made for a very welcoming stay. With all of the great things provided inside the apartment, what really makes it such a great value is its proximity to everything. We were a five minute walk from 6th street which made getting around downtown on a Friday night a piece of cake. As a whole, I cannot recommend this place enough and hope to return to it whenever I'm next in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a wonderful host and the accommodations were exactly as described! The best part is that the apartment is a 30 second walk from the convention center! His communication was extremely fast and thorough, access to the apartment was intuitive, and we had no issues. We'll be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place is top notch. Prime location, super close to 6th and all the downtown entertainment. Mark is flexible and great to work with. Not to mention his condo is comfy, clean and very nice. Secure building, always felt safe, with friendly neighbors as well. This was my first time in Austin and part of the reason my buddies and I had such a good time was Mark's place. 10/10 highly recommend. I'll be hitting him up next time im in town."
,,,,,,,,Unbelievable location!  Very clean and overall awesome stay.  Thanks Mark!
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was awesome! Super clean, easy to access and you cannot beat the location. It's right in the heart of the city and just a few minutes walk to Rainey, S. Congress and the river. Highly recommend"
,,,,,,,,"Mark was very helpful, and the check-in process was very fast and easy.  The neighborhood was great.  It was right in the middle of downtown, and close to a lot of restaurants and bars.  It's a short walk to both 6th St. and Rainey St.  The place was very clean, and great for the two of us.  "
,,,,,,,,Great location in Downtown Austin. Safe location with gated access. 5-10 minutes from 6th street with lots of places to eat in the area.
,,,,,,,,Great location and neighborhood. Very easy to access and Mark gave clear easy directions to follow. Would totally stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"It was great staying in Mark's place! Super central, near everything an out-of-towner wants to see. My friends and family were staying at the Courtyard Marriott which is directly across the street, making coordinating simple.
The apartment is clean, comfortable and way better than a hotel room. 
Highly recommended for any trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The condo was just as described and perfect for my two night business trip. You can't get any closer to the convention center! Mark was very accommodating and was quick to respond to texts when I had questions. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Mike was easy to reach and easy to communicate with, The place was what we expected and the Bed was super comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, great space and awesome host. There were a couple of bumps along the way but all were handled very well and we quite enjoyed our time. Cannot wait to return and will look to stay here again!! "
,,,,,,,,"Markâ€™s condo was the perfect lodging choice for our first trip to Austin. The location makes just about everything in the downtown district within walking distance. The condo was clean and nicely appointed. We received helpful information and tips from Mark by email prior to our arrival and prompt responses to the few questions we had upon our arrival. We enjoyed our stay in Austin and Markâ€™s condo and highly recommend both to everyone.
"
,,,,,,,,Great host extremely helpful and accommodating. The place is sensational. Awesome location and great value  
,,,,,,,,Great experience in the flat of Mark. The location is nice and very convenient to visit Austin. Mark gives all the information for a wonderful journey.
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host.  He communicated well with us, left us beer in the fridge, and we very helpful.

The space is in the perfect location for exploring Austin.  Right next to the convention center, with easy walking access to many Austin sites, easy access to renal bikes, and a taxi stand (and Uber/Lyft as well) across the street.

The space was comfortable.  My only feedback would be some minor upkeep needed in the bathroom, and the neighbors can occasionally be loud."
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was great. Exceptionally clean and tidy when we came in. Very nice appointments as well - furniture, appliances, counter tops, cabinets, etc. Very nice place. Mark was very responsive to our questions and comments and made the process a breeze."
,,,,,,,,"Was an awesome place, clean, modern, and had everything we needed. Location was superb, literally a 50 foot walk to the convention center. Recommend 100%."
,,,,,,,,"This is a great little condo, conveniently located in the downtown area. Tons of restaurants and bars in the vicinity, and very close to the Convention Center. Mark was responsive and provided lots of information and suggestions, both about the place and the city itself. If you are traveling to Austin, check this place out!"
,,,,,,,,"I was in town for SXSWedu, and Mark's apartment was the perfect home-base for me.  The location could not be beat, and the apartment itself was well-equipped and cozy, making it the perfect spot to relax between sessions.  I highly recommend staying in Mark's apartment!"
,,,,,,,,Had a great time staying here. This place is PERFECTLY LOCATED in the center of everything in Austin. Place was very clean and Mark was a great host and very responsive any time we needed to talk to him. His place has a washer and dryer if needed as well as multiple bath towels. Bed was comfy. Plan on bringing your own soaps for the shower. 
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host and was very quick to respond when i had a question, excellent customer service. The property itself is very conveniently located and is well taken care of. Very positive experience!"
,,,,,,,,Mark was very responsive. Apartment was in a great location and had eveything we needed. 
,,,,,,,,Mark was a great host and gave me a ton of information to make my trip very pleasant.
,,,,,,,,Mark's place was just as advertised. It was clean and in a fantastic location!
,,,,,,,,"Super location.....easy access to all downtown activities.
Secured and designated parking behind a gated area in the complex.  Mark has a perfect set-up for visitors to Austin.  Bed is a queen but it is very comfy!  Loved it all!!!"
,,,,,,,,Mark's flat was in the perfect location and was very comfortable. Checkin was easy and everything was as described.
,,,,,,,,"What am amazing experience it was staying a Marks place! Amazing location, easy parking, super clean condo, very responsive host.

I highly recommend staying here if you are staying in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Enjoyed my stay. Mark was responsive and loved the value of it.
,,,,,,,,Mark was so great in communication and making sure we had everything we needed. I asked if there was an ice maker and he offered to come by and drop off a bag of ice.  How nice and accommodating.  The space was great for us three girls and we loved his music set up.  The little building was so cute too.  we had all the dishes and glasses we needed.  we actually cooked in the place and found everything we needed there.  the location was essential too.  We walked to South Congress and to 6th street.  So close to Raney street too.  This place was clean and met all out expectations.
,,,,,,,,"Cozy, clean, nicely furnished apartment in an unbeatable location downtown - perfect for a quick trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Bottom line: I would stay in mark's unit again. It was the most comfortable Airbnb bed that I have ever slept in. Apt is extremely well-located across the street from the convention center, and a short walk to hotels and restaurants, as well as to sixth street, which is Austin's seedy strip for bars and restaurants but with an aggressive homeless population similar to what I've seen in San Francisco and downtown Salt Lake City (on sixth street, not near the unit). Also near wanderlust yoga, which is an outstanding community amenity. Apartment is very small, but extremely well appointed: leather chair and sofa in the tiny living room/kitchen, with wood floors, very effective blinds, and a tiny granite counter with comfortable stools where I was able to get work done in comfort. There was a fairly big screen TV, which I did not use, but it further tells the story that this host wants to deliver a good experience, and he does. He was ultra-responsive and friendly during the sign-up process, and was extremely gracious in letting me check-in early --since I took an early flight from NY -- after he first checked with his caretaker. (Don't assume he can do this for you. Depends on many factors I'm sure.) When there was a little mix-up about what would be in the unit (probably because I could have read the unit description more carefully), Mark first texted me me where the stores where, ranked by quality!, and then offered to come into town and do the shopping himself. Since the stores were a block away, that offer was completely unnecessary, but shows the extent to which this host is getting it done for his guests. Mark also has a caretaker with whom I corresponded, and who also appears to be very friendly. Travelers should be aware that this is not a classic Airbnb experience. Mark's unit is an investment unit in a building with a lot of other investor units (by coincidence I stayed in the same building on my prior trip), so you are not going to meet your host and bond with him and learn tidbits about the city from a local. In addition, the  building is three stories built around a courtyard with several steel staircases leading up to two levels of balconies over the courtyard. The doors to the apartments are reached from the balconies, so you will carry your luggage up one or two flights of stairs (in Mark's case, one). The windows of Mark's unit looks out over what I expected would be a fairly busy intersection along the balcony, and I was concerned about privacy, but hardly anyone ever walked by. I was awakened one night (out of two) by a group returning to the third floor, but in general it was quite quiet. All in all, a positive Airbnb experience and I'll look to return here if Mark will have me."
,,,,,,,,Apartment was easy to access and exactly as listed. The location is fantastic if you are in need of a place to stay near the convention center. 
,,,,,,,,"This place was in a perfect location! I felt so safe here because there were codes to get in the gated condo complex and my car was in a gated parking lot. Mark provided great recommendations on what to do in Austin, was super accommodating, and responded to any questions almost immediately. The place was very clean and was as pictured. I'd highly recommend this place--really, the location couldn't be any better!! Would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Good experience!
,,,,,,,,"Great value apartment, walking distance to everywhere in Austin.  Clean and accurate, would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Mark and his place were both awesome!

He was very detailed in his instructions which made for a seamless experience entering and leaving the place.

Absolutely cannot beat the location; walking distance to Sixth Street where all the action is, plenty of restaurants right around the corner, walking distance to Rainey Street with more action, and shopping for the lady on Second Street. We rented a car and had a dedicated parking spot. 

Place was in excellent condition and updated. Bed was big and super comfy... Slept in until 11am every morning.  Really comfortable place all-around. 

Definitely would stay here again the next time we visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The location was great and included parking was a huge bonus! I appreciated that Mark responded quickly when I had questions for him.
,,,,,,,,Mark provided us with everything we needed and the apartment was just as advertised!
,,,,,,,,"Mark's condo was exactly as described. Perfect location for being downtown - easy access to nightlife, restaurants and the convention center.   Full entertainment centerand kitchen for when you want to stay in and unwind (but that's unlikely given how much there is to do and see within walking distance), and a washer/dryer for when you forget to bring enough clothes for the trip.check in/out was also smooth. I would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great home in a perfect location- parking included!  The parking was key in downtown Austin and the price made this a perfect deal for us.  

One tiny thing to note: If you are a short person, the bed is very very very tall.  Mark does include a stepstool for you to use if you need it.

We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment as we were busy with wedding weekend fun, but it was a great place to have as our home base."
,,,,,,,,"For my in and out business trip, this was a perfect place over the hotel next door that was double the price for half the space. And the included parking, the way it is in downtown Austin, made it even better."
,,,,,,,,"Great location close to restaurants, bars, and the lake. We rented a car but really didn't need it. Mark was extremely accommodating, allowing us to check in a couple of hours early. We would definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,Mark was great!  The place and location was perfect.
,,,,,,,,Description was accurate - great location!!! Very clean and had everything we needed. Mark was easy to communicate with and was very accommodating. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was great, and perfect for us as it was just around the corner of the convention center. Super great location. THANKS!"
,,,,,,,,"Best part of this apartment was the location; it's walking distance to a lot of bars and restaurants and is located in a gated community.  The pictures are accurate but the apartment was smaller than I expected which I think is in part to the low ceiling in the bathroom.  Mark was easy to reach via text and while I did have issues connecting to the internet, he offered solutions and I was able to get by.  "
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was exactly as described and exactly what we were looking for. It was centrally located, quality furnishings, and reasonably priced. The instructions from Mark were thorough, accurate, and helpful. Mark was very communicative through the entire stay and arranged an early arrival/check-in for my friend. I would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Mark did a great job with communication.  I am very familiar with the city and area so I didn't need a lot, but he left no doubt that an Austin newbie would feel uncomfortable in any way.  The place was well maintained, clean, and nice.  I have zero complaints about the experience!"
,,,,,,,,This place is in a promo location in Austin.  It was perfectly located to all we wanted to do and all within walking distance.
,,,,,,,,"Great location, walking distance to everything, perfect spot for our stop in to Austin.  Thanks Mark!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location thats quiet, but within walking distance to the best of Austin. Check-in was a breeze, and the apartment was clean and comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"While we never met in person, Mark was very helpful and thorough, ensuring it was an easy and enjoyable stay for us! Everything is accessed by codes, so no keys were necessary which was wonderful. 

A few of us stayed there for ACL and it was the perfect location. We took an uber to the festival but we were able to walk home at night (it took about 30 minutes). The place was clean and in a great location - downtown near bars and restaurants so everything was within walking distance. He had the air mattresses pre-inflated which made our stay even easier and the bed can fit two people comfortably, plus the couch was nice as well.

I would definitely recommend this listing to a friend and would likely stay here again on my next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Thank you Mark for a great stay.  We're only sorry it was so quick.  Mark was extremely helpful and responsive with any questions and he sent us a great information list that explained everything in his condo.  The location is ideal and super convenient to all of downtown Austin, UT, and even South Congress.  His condo is immaculate, almost wanted to sleep on the leather couch it was so comfortable.  We'll definitely be back.  Thanks again Mark."
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host!  The place was pristine and exactly what was described.  It was cozy and in the perfect location for everything we wanted to discover.  From the bat bridge to Barton Springs or 2nd street shopping and kayaking, it's extremely close to all.  Everything is so convenient with Starbucks across the street and a convenience store across the street.  When it came to accommodations, there were plenty of extra towels and blankets to make me feel right at home.  The covered parking was also clutch!  Not having to worry about parking was so nice after having a night on the town."
,,,,,,,,"Clean place, convenient location and on-site parking."
,,,,,,,,"During my stay at Mark's apartment space, I did not get to meet Mark. However, he was very helpful and gave us all the information we needed for a great stay.

The apartment was in a perfect location (right across from the convention center and within walking distance to bars and restaurants). The space was very clean and had additional blankets, towels, and necessities for us. My only complaint would be that it was a bit noisy due to the enclosed type hallways with atriums throughout. I would definitely recommend staying here however!"
,,,,,,,,This was the easiest and most simple Airbnb experience I've had. I was only in Austin for one night and Mark had everything all sorted out for me to make my stay a breeze. In fact it was far easier than even trying to stay at a hotel/motel and had the perfect location as well! 
,,,,,,,,Great place in a great location. Easy check in and out. Good price for the location. Very pleased. 
,,,,,,,,"Loved this apt!  Clean, cozy and convenient!  It was perfect since we were there for a convention and to my surprise we were literally a crosswalk away!  We could easily access restaurants near by and there was an Uber nearby at all times.  Perfect for those who want to dine out or stay in with the kitchen.  Thanks Mark for hosting us you are awesome!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely loved the place!! Everything was as advertised, clean, quiet, with an excellent location, and Mark was above and beyond accommodating. Can't wait to stay here again in the near future."
,,,,,,,,"The place was clean, and Mark was accommodating.
I find that the place was terrible For the price I paid! It was small with windows facing the inside corridors And The bed was uncomfortable. It was not a bad place, just very overpriced...."
,,,,,,,,"My stay in Austin was a good one!  I arrived at Marks place and was fortunate to get a early check in because my flight arrived in the morning.  Took the bus downtown from the airport which was an easy commute.  Finding the building and getting into the home was simple.  Everything was clean and the place looked great. 
After exploring the city some I realized just how great of a location this place is!  Thanks Mark for making my stay enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,The place was a perfect location for my convention center needs. Everything was easy to understand and get into which made check in and out a breeze. 
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment, just as described excellent location!!!"
,,,,,,,,"The Place was centrally located and Mark was prompt about providing directions on how to get there and how to get in. Air Conditioning was on when I got there(A plus in Austin Summers) and everything was in good shape. Great to have a washer and dryer in the unit if you are traveling for extended periods. 

All in all the experience was great. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and a very clean apartment. One suggested improvement is in the bathroom. The shower controls need to be adjusted to permit the shower to be warmer. The water temperature is luke warm at best. Also the airator in the bathroom faucet is clogged which makes the water spray all over the place. Nice TV and Bose sound system. Great air conditioning!
,,,,,,,,"We liked our stay at Mark's place.  The listing was accurate and met our needs (three New Yorkers!) exceptionally well.  The bedroom was spacious, and there was plenty of room in the common area for an air mattress. 

We appreciated the amenities such as the ironing board, washer and dryer, as well as the kitchen. It made our stay very convenient.

Two snafu's. 1. When the fridge door opens, it turns on the oven. So that's something to watch for.

2. There was an issue with some exposed nails on the floor in the laundry room, but Mark had promised to compensate me for the accident.

Neighborhood is convenient and quiet. Three blocks from all of the action on 6th street! 

Overall, 8.5 out of 10."
,,,,,,,,"Mark's condo was beautiful, perfectly located and exactly as advertised!  We booked last minute and he was very accomodating!  We had gated, covered parking and were literally walking distance from all the fun parts of downtown.  

Mark was just a text away and helped us through the very easy check in process.  Can't say enough good things about this Airnb experience!  Because this went so well we booked our trip to San Diego in 2 weeks through Airnb as well!  Thanks Mark for a great experience!  Farah and Charlie"
,,,,,,,,"Great place and super convenient location to downtown conference hotels.  Mark was very responsive and answered all my questions beforehand, and everything was just as advertised when I arrived.  I'll definitely book again when I need to stay in the area!"
,,,,,,,,Place is clean. Location is great. We enjoyed our stay. 
,,,,,,,,"Mark was very helpful for us first time airbnb users. His response time is amazing! He answers all questions promptly. Mark's welcome packet was detailed and helpful. He even sent a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map of recommended spots in Austin. Mark graciously directed us to local grocery stores too. 
The place is accurately described and very comfortably hosted 3 of us. We felt right at home cooking meals in his kitchen and doing laundry. 
The location was perfect for our week long event at the convention center - right across the street! Our family walked to many good restaurants and sights too. Being able to park in a secure, reserved spot was a great extra benefit as well.
If our event schedule hadn't been so full, we would have enjoyed the cute pool in the sister condo complex. 
When we return to Austin, we will be sure to check if Mark's place is available. We had an excellent time. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was great!  Communication with Mark was easy, as was the check-in process.  Mark also provided a lot of helpful information regarding parking, transportation, places to go, etc.  The photos posted are an exact match to what you see when you arrive.  Very clean, lots of space and has all the basic amenities.  The location couldn't be better.  We walked to all the bars/restaurants on 6th St. (as well as many others on adjacent streets!), and we walked to the Capitol, SoCo, Rainey St., the bat bridge and restaurant row.  The bus stop for the airport bus is right across the street.  Very convenient.  We would definitely stay here on our next trip to Austin!
"
,,,,,,,,"We had a good stay at Mark's condo. The condo is in a great location downtown, with lots of restaurants within walking distance. It was also great to have our own gated parking spot (a huge plus!). We stayed at the condo in the middle of the week, so it was very quiet at night. Mark was a great host. He gave us super-detailed information about accessing the condo and was quick to respond. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"This is the perfect location for all things downtown Austin.  This was our first Airbnb experience and were not sure what to expect.  Dealing with Mark was wonderful.  The condo was nicely decorated, clean and the perfect location.   Mark sent us some places to eat/visit/work out while we were in town. (All within walking distance).  We are looking forward to coming back to Austin and staying at Mark's condo."
,,,,,,,,Mark was very helpful and provided detailed instructions to accessing the apartment. It was tidy and comfortable for our short stay. Thank you.
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a very helpful host who was available for all questions. The apartment was spotless and had all the comforts of home. The location of Mark's apartment was excellent. Right downtown, near all the action. If I was working the convention center, Mark's would be my first choice."
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host. He was helpful and communicative. His place was exactly as advertised, clean and comfortable. A great place!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark sent all of the information I needed for my stay in advance so I was well informed and comfortable with my stay even before I arrived. The place was clean, as pictured and a great place to relax after my long days working."
,,,,,,,,"Whenever I need to rent a place in Austin I check Mark's listing first. 

Mark has perfected the art of the seamless checkin and checkout.

He's a great host and his unit is in a great location (literally a stone's throw away from the downtown convention centre).  
It is always clean, comfortable and welcoming.  I love this place. 

I highly recommend this unit.  
"
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesomeâ€”just as the listing described.  It was an ideal location and very clean. I even forgot my towels, but it turns out they were provided for us! Major bonus points for not having to deal with keys. Mark was also quick to respond to messages/emails sent. (Every now and then it could get a little noisy since the bed is right next to the wall that faces the outside of the condo.) Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Very clean & great location for us. We were very happy with our stay & very first Airbnb experience. Would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,Wonderful apartment in central Austin. Clean space with plenty of amenities.
,,,,,,,,Staying here at Mark's place was very quick and easy.  Mark gave very detailed instructions on how to get there and provided a lot of extra and useful information.  Great location within walking distance to convention center and all over downtown.  Would definitely recommend.
,,,,,,,,Mark was an excellent host and had everything ready to go. I will be going back for my next trip to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have been better. Mark thought of everything ahead of time, so we needed very little when we arrived; his communication beforehand was thorough and timely. I texted him once during our stay over a minor question and he gave a prompt reply. "
,,,,,,,,Great location. Close to 6th st which had a lot of bars and restaurants.  The walls were thin so it was very easy to hear outside noise (especially on Friday night as there were a few parties). We had earplugs though so it wasn't too bad. Overall we were pleased.
,,,,,,,,"Listing was accurate, very clean place with two ready to go air mattresses. Convenient code system on apartment door and apartment complex entries to avoid hassle with keys. Great location just two blocks away from sixth street."

,,,,,,,,Everything was really smooth. Not a single hitch
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience in Mark's.  The apartment was clean, location was great, and price was right.  Thank you Mark!
The apartment is simply ideal for people who want to spend the weekend in Austin. It has a queen size bed, a couch, two air mattresses. It also comes with a gated parking spot 
By the way the instruction on how to get through the gates and to the parking was very good.



I could not resist reading some surviving guide book that was laying around!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark was very welcoming, answered all my questions in a timely manner, and maintains a really great place! It's right near all the festivities downtown, very walkable: the perfect spot for a couple's weekend getaway in Austin! I highly recommend this place when staying in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was fantastic. Really clean, spacious and cool from the Austin heat. Mark was easily contactable and flexible. The condo is in an excellent position and near some really great bars and restaurants. We had a great time and would highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay. Nice and clean, reasonably priced and so close to everything. Really appreciated the bluetooth speakers and that he already had soaps and other bathroom supplies on stock. Also loved being able to walk to Rainey St for the evening. Will definitely stay here again when I am in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was clean, comfortable, and he was very accommodating. Right downtown so it was very easy to get to and from. I would stay again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first AirBnB, and it couldn't have been better. Mark's hospitality (through his communication leading up to our stay) was excellent. His place was clean and stylish, and had the right about of space for 3 people. The location was perfect--in the heart of downtown without being loud, right next to the inbound and outbound bus stops to the airport. I'm definitely glad I chose this over a hotel."
,,,,,,,,"Mark was extremely welcoming via email, text, and phone. Suggested a great jazz spot nearby and helped us with other logistics. Property is in a great location and the description right on target. Mark was also very helpful during our visit."
,,,,,,,,Stayed here for the 2015 Austin Food and Wine Festival. The condo is very comfortable and felt like home during our 2 nights there. Great location that is convenient to anywhere you want to go to downtown.  Mark was an excellent host and provided us everything we needed during our stay. He is easy to get in contact with and was quick to respond to any questions we had. We will be keeping this place on our short list of places to stay in downtown Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Mark was really helpful and the apartment was centrally located, clean, and comfortable. Definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,Condo was awesome and in a great location. Mark's instructions made entry and exit easy. Would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was just as described - comfortable, clean, and in an ideal location! I was in town for business, and with a super early wake up, I didn't get to really enjoy the perks of being so close to so much. But it is definitely in a prime spot for taking advantage of Austin's fun! I would love to go back another time and do just that. "
,,,,,,,,Myself and two friends drove down to Austin for the day/night and had a great stay at this AirBnb. Great location and Mark was super accommodating. We had some trouble getting into the condo parking lot with my car but we called him up and he was very helpful. He gave some great recommendations on places to eat and drink. It was super convenient getting in and out of the condo....don't need a key! I would highly recommend staying here.
,,,,,,,,Back again. Everything I said in my first review stands. Great locationâ€”definitely recommended.
,,,,,,,,"Location was great for a first time visit to Austin. We were in town for a wedding and found everything to be within walking distance. The condo is exactly as pictured. The room/bathroom was a little small, but more than enough for two. Host provided a great list of attractions/restaurants to try and various info about the condo. Communication was exactly what you want from a host, no need for contact but very responsive if anything comes up. Having the ability for laundry, wifi, and entertainment system was nice.

If you're older you should expect some noise in the evenings from the guests/homeowners after enjoying the Dirty 6 (6th street bars). Nothing ear plugs didn't fix and the location/price/ability to host friends before the wedding was nice."
,,,,,,,,"Mark's apartment is in an amazing location, right by the exhibition centre, just a walk to Congress, an easy walk to Rainey St (well, it's pretty much easy walking to everywhere), plus good coffee within a couple of blocks at Houndstooth or Patika. Plus with a car space, there's a place to keep your car for the longer jaunts.

The apartment itself is very comfortable and just as described. The couches are great, and his living room has a great set-up if you want to just chill and watch some TV for a while.

I found the bed a little unsupportiveâ€”it tended to sag a bitâ€”but it was very soft. I just prefer a firmer bed I guess. I'm sure others would have no problems with it.

Overall, though, we had a great stay at Mark's place, and I'd definitely recommend it for location alone"
,,,,,,,,"Mark was super helpful from the moment I booked. Very quick to respond and accomodate requests. His home is in a really great part of Austin and it was easy to walk to most of the places we wanted to go. Also, was super helpful to have a parking spot, so we never had to drive around or feed meters. His place was very clean and had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here again if I'm lucky enough to get back to Austin in the future.  "
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was really great!  He gave detailed instructions on what to do when you arrive and made it really easy to get in to the place on my schedule.  AWESOME location, just a block or two from awesome bars, restaurants etc.  Having private parking was the best, as I was never worried about my car being left in a dangerous place.  I would absolutely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark was an awesome host!  I've stayed at a few places in this complex and this was by far the best place.  Awesome amenities including coffee & an awesome TV & sound system.

"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's condo was the ideal SXSW spot for me and my friends. It's *precisely* as pictured/described: clean, comfortable, and incredibly handily located. And Mark (whom I never met in person, but who was instantly responsive and helpful by email, phone, and text) was an excellent host. He sent a detailed email with lots of useful information after we booked, and had the place clean and ready for us the day we arrived, despite tight turn-around times with other departing SXSWers.
I can't emphasize enough how great the location is: each morning, I could saunter across the street to the Convention Center in my pjs to queue for my SXXpress pass, then toodle back ""home"" for a little more shut-eye before rolling out for the music. Coming from Chicago, I was enchanted by the courtyard's blossoming redbud, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)ing sparrows, and little fountain--a lovely infusion of spring. The condo perfectly balanced providing a retreat from the fray and easy access to all the action.
Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was in a perfect location, easily accessible, clean and exactly as described. Mark was easy to reach and beyond helpful. Would recommend to anyone visiting Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Cute place.  Quiet and secure complex.  Place is nicely decorated and complete with everything you will need.  Railyard complex is perfect location (close to conference center and easy access to 6th street - but far enough to be quiet at night).  Clean and comfortable, I would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Nice place!  Mark was very responsive and easy to work with.  And the bed is really comfortable!    My first Airbnb venture was a complete success!
,,,,,,,,"Great experience. Killer location, easy check in and check out. Couldn't ask for more. "
,,,,,,,,We had absolutely all the information we needed for the visit.  Mark made us feel like we were visiting our family or good friends.
,,,,,,,,"Location is perfect, especially for the Convention Center.  Condo is exactly as pictured and description is on point.  Host provided a great list of attractions/restaurants to try and various info about the condo.  Communication was exactly what you want from a host, no need for contact but very responsive if anything comes up.  Walkable to pretty much anything you may need.  No need for a car, but parking is convenient and private.  Lots of extra conveniences included in the space, including laundry and a set of dishware.  TV/entertainment system are nice, bed is very comfortable, everything was clean and cozy.  Would definitely stay here again if/when I am in Austin, and I would recommend this place to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"Mark was attentive and quick to answer our questions. The apartment was in a great locations, and the amenities were exactly as described. "
,,,,,,,,Mark was on point. Made sure myself and the group I was traveling with were in good hands. Great place!
,,,,,,,,Very welcoming apartment in a great downtown location with reserved parking. Fantastic instructions and incredibly comfortable bed. Would come back. 
,,,,,,,,"Mark was super responsive to any questions we had & I had a lot of them as this was our first airbnb experience.   The location was perfect for us as we could walk to Rainey Street and downtown so easily.   Thanks, Mark!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean apartment with a car parking space in perfect location. 5-10 mins walk to Elephant Room jazz bar at 315 Congress Ave, Iron Works BBQ at 100 Red River St (try sampler plate) , grocery nearby, Esther's Follies show at 525 East 6th St. We liked staying in Mark's place."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, exactly as advertised. Perfect location and comfortable place. Look forward to staying here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Outstanding. Great apt, well set up for guests with air mattresses and towels and stuff. Excellent system for checking in and out (no keys just door codes). Mark was extremely responsive, the place was spotless, and he even sent us a list of cool stuff to do in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Mark was great and super helpful and available when we needed to extend our stay due to a cancelled flight. The place is SO convenient, easy to find and just precisely what we needed. Very clean and comfortable space. Can be a bit noisy, but hey, you're right downtown, so totally expected... thanks so much!"
,,,,,,,,Great location and nice apt!
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was perfect as a jumping-off point for our Austin adventures. Great location, great apartment - we felt right at home."
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I stayed at Marks apartment for three nights.  The apartment was clean and spacious.  It was comfortable and had extra pillows and blankets if we needed.  The kitchen was stocked with mugs, bowls, utensils, etc.  the apartment was located right in downtown Austin, amidst all the great restaurants.  The location couldn't have been better.  We walked to the Capitol building.  Only two blocks away from 6th street.  Comes with a parking spot which was great for us since we had a car.  Mark was very easy to reach by phone, email or text at all times during our visit.  A great visit overall!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a blast at Mark's place! The apartment is in the heart of downtown, walking distance to everything! Mark was very accommodating to our check in and checkout times. We were able to stay until our right before our flight, which was great and so helpful! His welcome email had many recommendations for things to do and how to get around Austin. Easily can sleep up to 5 ppl with 1 bed, a couch, and an air mattress.  Great apartment, great area, and great host!! Thanks Mark!!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark provided exactly what was advertised and even more!!!! He Provided us with tons of information on the area! He was very responsive to my emails and text messages. I would without a doubt stay in Marks place again!!!! Thanks Mark!!!!!!
"
,,,,,,,,Mark's Apartment was great! Fantastic location to 6th st and downtown. We really enjoyed our stay.
,,,,,,,,Wonderful apartment super close to the convention center and the rest of downtown. Mark was very accommodating and emailed me all of the access / apartment info immediately after I booked. Great experience and I'll definitely keep the place bookmarked for future business trips out to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Great center location, clean unit and easy access via airport. Recommended if looking to stay downtown. "
,,,,,,,,Mark's place was perfect for our stay. It was clean and inviting.  Mark was a great host.  Instructions were easy to follow.  
,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent apartment. Clean, super good location, comfy

Would recommend to anyone that wants to stay at a good location in downtown Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Mark was very organized and made our stay smooth and easy. The condo is in a great location and is nice and clean. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"I was only in Austin for one night but would definitely stay at Mark's place again. We communicated often before my arrival and he always responded quickly. He was polite and respectful and very helpful and accommodating. The apartment is in a great location and surrounded by restaurants and bars. It's a great place, very clean and perfect for a short trip. I was very pleased with my stay and would recommend Mark to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"nice, clean place, very convenient."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great.  The condo was nicely furnished, the bed was really comfortable, everything was clean, and the location was fantastic.   There is a private parking space and all kinds of bars, restaurants and music venues in close walking distance.  Mark responded quickly to my booking request and all subsequent emails and was a friendly and gracious host.  I plan on bringing my wife down with me for a weekend and definitely plan on staying here again."
,,,,,,,,"Mark was awesome! He communicated well and provided a map of his recommended places. The condo is very nice, in a great location and is very comfortable. The extremely high bed is a bit odd but comfortable once we added some white noise to the ambiance with our cell phone app (our problem, not his!) One thing to note, on Friday and Saturday nights, the condo building can be very loud/echo-y. The way it is built you can literally hear everything everyone says in the common areas and outdoor hallways. Also not Mark's fault...just know going in that you might not sleep until the post-bar traffic comes back home on those nights. Other nights it was perfect and quiet. Love the wood flooring in the living room and  the kitchen was great. Also liked not having to worry about keys. It was a wonderful home base for a long weekend!"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was great! He was in contact the whole time, very polite. The place has a great location that leaves everything in downtown walking distance, no needs for cabs or anything! The kitchen is great too for those that might be staying a little longer. The only thing is, bring a bag of ice, the fridge doesn't have an icemaker but mark has supplied a few ice trays. 

This was a wonderful first Airbnb experience and would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,Mark was great!  He was very responsive to my texts and my emails.  There was difficulty getting information through on the airbnb page so Mark went to special effort to make the specific info I needed available.  He also provide information about Austin venues and fun stuff to do.  Mark even helped me get to my conference location in the historic repurposed courthouse building on 8th Street.
,,,,,,,,Mark was an awesome host and the condo is true to its description--awesome space and location. Would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Thank you Mark.  Your place was clean, a great location downtown and reasonable. I will highly recommend you. Thank you for taking the time to respond to my questions quickly."
,,,,,,,,Mark was very quick to connect and and provided great information about the place.  The place was very comfortable and clean. The location was perfect and close to everything. I would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay in Austin. Mark's place was great and he was very helpful and friendly in all of his emails. The location was perfect - an easy walk to anywhere downtown.
,,,,,,,,"Great central location. Very clean. Parking spot was very convenient.

Mark was very responsive the whole time. He provided everything we needed and very clear details on getting there, the building, and the apt to make our stay seamless."
,,,,,,,,"The host, Mark, was very easy to work with and he responded quickly.  The condo had everything we needed and was clean and kept well.  "
,,,,,,,,"Marks' place in Austin is terrific.  Centrally located, yet on a nice, quiet  street - near tons of great restaurants and bars.  Except for driving out of town to try some Texas hill country BBQ, we never needed to touch the car.  On our last day, he was even kind enough to arrange for a friend to watch our bags between checkout and our evening flight. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"All as advertised: great location, great place, and Mark is a great host who makes things super convenient. "
,,,,,,,,"This apartment could not be easier to get to from the airport, being just yards from the bus stop.  Mark had sent a detailed email allowing us to gain access and get settled in so the whole process from landing to relaxing was seamless!  Just a short walk from the bustle, food and drink of East Sixth Street and from Congress Avenue and the Capitol, the area around the apartment feels safe, friendly and accessible at all hours.

The apartment was immaculate and comfortable with everything you want in a crash pad.  Because it faces a covered courtyard there is virtually no natural light, but this keeps it deliciously cool all day and it is a joy to return to after the Austin heat.  Highly recommended, an amazing city and a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Listing description and photos are exact, the house is amazing and Mark's pre-arrival email is EXTREMELY detailed to help ensure you feel like its your own home. "
,,,,,,,,See previous review
,,,,,,,,"This is a great condo with a terrific location and reasonable price. I was attending a conference at the convention center and it's right across the street. It's also close to all the fun things in downtown Austin like 6th St. Although the location is busy, the condo itself is very quiet and there is a nice courtyard in the center of it and it's very secure. It also has fast WiFi and Mark was helpful and responsive and checked in on us. I'd stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Location awesome, Bed comfortable
And host wonderful- I'll be back"
,,,,,,,,"Consider yourself lucky if you are able to stay at this castle! The place is ultra chill with a hip, modern vibe. A buddy and I stayed here for a night and it was perfect. Location is prime. Mark was very helpful and seems like a great guy. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Mark's Condo is SUPER convenient to all that Austin has to offer. It's cool, comfy and clean - I would definitely stay there again and recommend it. Mark was also a great host, we was super responsive and helpful throughout our stay."
,,,,,,,,I stayed at Mark's place this past weekend with a couple of friends and we couldn't have had a better experience! The apartment is in a great location downtown and close to everything. It was also very quiet. Mark was very helpful and provided a lot of information about the place prior to our arrival. We ran into Margot when we first arrived and she was excellent in helping us get settled. I will definitely request to book again the next time I am in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host leading up to and during our trip to Austin. He responded quickly to all of my questions and sent us helpful information regarding directions, accessing the building, parking, and recommendations for the area. The only tiny snag was that the remote to allow us access to the parking area wasn't working. We called Mark and he immediately had his neighbor meet us with an extra remote opener.

We were also very happy with the cleanliness and location of Mark's place. We were able to walk to great bars, food, and live music, and we also used the nearby bike share to ride around and check out the city."
,,,,,,,,Location was great. Mark was very responsive. Great stay!!
,,,,,,,,"Mark was very responsive and left very detailed instructions on gaining access to the unit and other tips. 

The condo is in a great location - right across the street from the convention center and just a few blocks to 6th Street. Plenty of restaurants to walk to. 

The condo overlooks an interior courtyard and is a little dark, which is great for sleeping. The place was also very quiet and although I didn't use, the parking space was convenient. 

Nice size space and clean. I was very comfortable staying here. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a fabulous time in Mark's condo in downtown Austin! If you want to be downtown, this was absolutely prime location. We were even able to walk to the cute shops in the SoCo area.  The area really could not have been better. We also really appreciated and relied on the very well crafted email Mark sent us with detailed instructions and his personal recommendations. It is clear he really cares about providing a great experience. 

The only constructive feedback or caution I would add is that this condo is in downtown clearly around a lot of partiers. The walls are not insulated very well so on both Friday and Saturday nights, the neighbors were so loud into the wee hours of the morning that we didnt sleep much.  Not something Mark can do much about, but definitely something to know if you dont want to be around that atmosphere. 

Otherwise, the condo provided everything we needed, was comfortable, and (URL HIDDEN) even had a parking space beyond a closed gate. We would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host, provided all necessary information and very quick to reply if I did have any questions. "
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 227 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Marks place was perfect. Great location just 2 blocks off the main drag and 4 blocks from the Colorado river. Homey and cosy with lots of a/c made it a perfect spot for our stay. Mark was helpful and available at all times for any questions we had. I would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely fantastic stay. Place was super clean, exactly as described. I would definitely come back and stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Mark was courteous and quick to respond. He was knowledgeable of the area and had many recommendations. His instructions were clear and detailed. This was my first time using airbnb - it was simple and an easy transition from looking up the property to payment to communicating with the host to checking out. 

He rents out the entire place so heâ€™s never there.

As soon as I opened the door to the place it smelled cleaned, the wood floors were shiny, and everything was put in place.  What you see in the picture is the truth and it wasn't expensive. He offers towels, washer & dryer, TV with surround system, a clean kitchen, etc. etc...

It was like staying at a friendâ€™s house minus the payment part.

I needed a late check out on Sunday and he was flexible with that. I was in town to party and to go float the Comal River. The centralized location made it attractive and convenient, the neighborhood is clean and safe â€“ you can walk to most places. 

Thereâ€™s a cool sports bar across the street, 6th Street is about two blocks away, and there are several restaurants across the street. 

This is a prime location. Rent it!
"
,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed my stay at Marks place.  The condo was clean, comfortable, and right in the middle of  that happening part of town. I booked the place while still on the flight and he quickly responded and by the time I landed I had a place to go to! Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Mark's place. The condo is awesome. Very comfortable, super clean, and right across the street from the convention center. Everything we needed was close by.

,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at Mark's apartment. Centrally located, cool with the air conditioning, much needed washer and dryer. 

It was a bit of an adventure each night ""climbing"" into bed each night - the bed is on platform stilts, but no complaints on the comfort! 
"
,,,,,,,,Mark does a great job of handling this property.   You don't have to arrange a time to pick up the keys because he provides the codes you will need to access the unit which is very convenient. The location and quality of the apartment are all top notch.  I would rent from Mark again.
,,,,,,,,This place was unbelievably close to the convention centre; literally 1 min walk from the doors. Mark was a fine host with detailed instructions on how to use everything in the place. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed for a week's stay. It made for a great conference and a great experience in Austin. I will stay there again next time I have a conference in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"If you want to stay in a central location to enjoy Austin, this is the place! 6th Street is few blocks in one direction and Rainey Street is a few blocks in the other direction (both within walking distance). 

The apartment was very neat and clean.  Everything that was promised in the airbnb description was delivered.

Mark is a great host. He provided check-in information and logistics in advance and answered my questions promptly. The next time I go to Austin this is the first place that I will check for availability."

,,,,,,,,The location is super convenient. You are basically 2 blocks away from the happening center of Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Mark's place was perfect for a quick Austin business trip. The location is great! Beer in the fridge for guests to enjoy? Yeah, we can be friends."
,,,,,,,,"Stayed here for 4 nights as part of a tour of Texas - perfect location, easy both to drive to and walk to/from the various city 'hotspots'. Especially ideal for 6th St and it's vast array of bars with live music and some unbelievable food.

Mark's instructions were spot-on and he emailed over a map of recommended places to visit which was really helpful. Looking forward to using this place again next time we're in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great place. Great location. Mark was great. Perfect place to stay. 
,,,,,,,,Staying at Mark's place was one of the best stays i have had on Airbnb. His place was clean and just as he has mentioned on the website . He makes sure everything is well organized . His secretary is a call away if you need help with something . He welcomed us with two six packs of local beer . Great location . Will definitely stay again if in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Mark was a great host. I really enjoyed the location and it's proximity to all the bars and restaurants. It kind of feels like Melrose place inside the condo complex, sans the drama. His place was very clean and the fridge was stocked with some local libations. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks for everything. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was FANTASTIC. In the heart of it, esp if you are attending anything at the conference center. Mark was efficient, courteous, responsive, and a great host. This was the PERFECT spot for me and my team.  "
,,,,,,,,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Mark. He was polite, prompt to respond, and easy to work with! He gave us great suggestions for food and things to see. We loved the location of his place. Tucked in the middle of downtown, we were able to walk everywhere. We could hear no traffic or street noise, the windows and front door all face into a lovely courtyard. If you plan on visiting the convention center, ACL Live, 6th street, Rainey Street, Zilker Park, Barton Creek, UT area... this is THE place to stay! We liked the apartment so much we decided to spend a night in and enjoy it! We can't recommend Mark enough! Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was great and Mark was a wonderful host!  You could not find a better location in Austin (walking/short driving distance to 6th st, SoCo, Rainey Street, Zilker Park, etc.), the apartment was very nice and clean, and Mark was very accommodating with check in/check out.  He also gave us a great list of local food and activity spots in the area, and whenever I had a question about anything like the parking or locations for grocery stores he responded within the hour.  I would recommend his place to anyone (esp. first time visitors to Austin like myself)!"

,,,,,,,,"Great apartment, just across the street from Convention Center and a Starbucks (although Mark had provided coffee)! Mark was easy to communicate with and helpful regarding details of our stay. He even sent us well wishes during the evening for traveling as we were traveling during one of the Southern Ice storms Austin received. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find the lights and heat on when we arrived after 0100 am due to travel/ road delays. Apartment was clean, quiet and cozy... perfect for our needs. Thanks Mark! Next time we are in Austin, we are at your place!"

,,,,,,,,"Awesome location, right across the street from the convention center and near the downtown area.

Place was very comfortable and had everything I needed. Good heating really helped with the cold and rain that hit Austin when I got there. I was also pleasantly surprised how quiet it was at night for a good night's sleep.

Mark communicated well every step of the way, making my first Airbnb experience painless."

,,,,,,,,"Mark's place is an absolute gem in Downtown ATX! I was lucky to find his place for a decent price given the huge music festival going on the same weekend. He was quick, courteous, and had a ton of fun and helpful suggestions for me.

His apartment is located in a gated complex with your own parking spot - I felt as safe as can be each night I was there! His place was luxuriously decorated with by far the comfiest sofa and bed I've been on. The shower was a little tricky to use (almost felt like I was gonna rip it out of the wall!) but overall fine. Mark was great enough to provide ample towels and even a bottle of red waiting for us on the counter. 

Great place and 110% recommended. Walking distance to 6th street and Austin Music Hall where I went for one night. Plenty of things to do all around. Thanks so much Mark!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time staying in Mark's apartment. It was exceptionally clean and inviting, with all the amenities you could want! The location was the best part, the apartment is situated in an ideal location for everything in downtown Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Mark was a very good host! Definitely recommend his place on any travels to the dowtown area. The apartment is walking distance to 6th street! He gave great recommendations and made us feel at home. Will definitely book his place again on a return trip to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Mark was extremely courteous and ensured that my wife and I were perfectly comfortable.  He offered great recommendations and kept an open line of communication during our entire stay.  The space was very nice and within walking distance of everything that we wanted to do while in Austin.  This was my first airbnb experience and Mark made it memorable! 
,,,,,,,,Mark was very accommodating and made it easy for us to check out and in. His apartment was very clean and comfortable. It's an amazing location and was perfect for SXSW. Highly recommended!

It is located within a quiet neighborhood that is conveniently located within walking distance to restaurants, nightlife, Town Lake, and a neighborhood park just a short walk down the road.  Caroline was always responsive if we had any issues or questions."
,,,,,,,,"Host was responsive and helpful, not there on site but available by phone. "
,,,,,,,,"First off, Caroline is an amazing host. My family was traveling to Austin for Thanksgiving but my youngest daughter had a pretty serious medical emergency that caused us to completely change our plans. Caroline was extremely helpful, understanding, and flexible. She was one of the best hosts I have ever had on Airbnb.

Check in and check out were both a complete breeze. 

The house is super cute and super clean. It had everything you could possibly need and was quite spacious. The neighborhood is great. Because it was Thanksgiving, I didn't try any of the restaurants in the neighborhood but Cafe Medici is great for coffee (and I am a San Francisco coffee snob). Easily walkable to Whole Foods and the N. Lamar shopping district as well as to Zilker Park. The neighborhood is very quiet. Very quiet. Which was great for sleeping and just winding down. It is a great location for a family (hence why we chose it). 

Overall, a great stay and I will stay here again when visiting."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Clean house. Great outdoor space for relaxing. Super available and flexible host. Comfortable beds.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Awesome experience.
,,,,,,,,"Caroline's house was in the Clarksville neighborhood, just a block north of 6th and in very close proximity to a lot of great shops/restaurants, a giant park, and other things to do. We walked downtown most days. The house was extremely clean and inviting. It had all of the amenities we needed and the perfect amount of space for our group. I really appreciated the abundance of clean towels and fast wifi. The master bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was very clean! I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Our host was sure to check in with us especially if we had any questions. We enjoyed the space very much! Clean and well kept upon arrival and all good amenities. Great location. We felt right at home and comfortable.
,,,,,,,,This place is in a great location. Caroline is very easy to get in contact with and check in and check out we're very easy.
,,,,,,,,"This cottage was the perfect location for our weekend getaway. The house was clean and looked just like it does in the pictures.

Though there wasn't shampoo/soap as listed, the cottage was still a nice place to stay. Plus, the beds were quite cozy. Would definitely recommend this location to anyone wanting to experience (near) downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Host provided easy step by step instructions on the check in process, house was very clean,  location was great.  "
,,,,,,,,Carolina was a great host. The place was very clean when we got there and it was just as listed.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect little cottage, 2nd stay."
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful experience in Austin! Not only was it an amazing city, but we had the best time staying at Caroline's place! It was conveniently located near the bars and restaurants, as well as walking distance to dog parks and the river. It was such a pleasant surprise that she had two available bicycles, locks included, that we could use to cruise around the city. The cottage was perfect! It had everything we needed, and then some!  In addition, if I needed anything or had any questions, Caroline was readily available. We are already starting to plan our next trip to Austin, and we are looking forward to staying in Caroline's cottage once again!"
,,,,,,,,"Just as described, perfect small cottage, great location. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was just as charming and beautiful as the photos! It may have even been bigger in real life than it appeared in the photos. There was a cute backyard, two bikes to use, two beds (1 king, 1 queen) and a comfy couch that pulls out to be bed.

The neighborhood of Clarksville is quaint and charming but still a walking distance to the downtown restaurants and bars, as well as not too far form Zilker Park and the river!

Caroline was an awesome host - everything was easy. Would recommend it to anyone visiting Austin for a fun weekend with friends!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful rental. 
,,,,,,,,"Amazing experience, beautiful house. We booked last minute & it was ready for us. Thanks so much Caroline. "
,,,,,,,,"This is a beautiful little house in an awesome neighborhood of Austin â€“ super convenient to just about everything. The house was clean, well-stocked and cozy, and the hosts were super quick to respond about anything we needed. The back deck is probably the home's best feature â€“ it's a great place to grill dinner or just sit out for hours with a bottle of wine, enjoying the Texas weather. Great homebase for a great city! Hope to stay here again next time life brings us through Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great spot in old west Austin. Walkable to some good restaurants, hair/nail salon, boutiques. The house was as described and absolutely adequate for our NYE stay. Nice style! One recommendation would be to hire someone to pick up previous guests dog poo in the backyard. Each guest should be responsible for doing it for their own dog, but when they fail, perhaps the cleaning crew? Get one of those convenient scoopers. Anyway, there were too many poo mounds to enjoy the backyard but we weren't planning to hang back there much anyway. Would rent again. Love this area! Owner provided all info as needed- calling her directly seemed to be best. Thanks Caroline!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 92 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The apartment is a perfect location that allows you to explore Austin by foot easily. We arrived and it was very clean and provided us with comfortable beds and great space for the 4 of us (2 adults with 2 older children) to live. 
We stayed for a week over NYE and as much as we expected it to be noisy we were pleased that it wasn't too crazy. We loved the closeness to fabulous restaurants and great things to do. The Escape Game, Scavenger Hunt, kayaking and more. We drive to San Antonio for a day to explore and we're thrilled that we chose to stay at Ryan's place in Austin. 
You have found a great place to stay. Book now and enjoy! "
,,,,,,,,Well kept and very convenient location!
,,,,,,,,Ryan is super responsive. You cannot beat the location if you're looking to enjoy downtown amenities.
,,,,,,,,The area was perfect! We were able to walk to a cycling class and to dinner.  Ryan was great and very helpful! Highly recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"Generally a very nice place. Extremely clean, nice furniture, very comfortable. The neighborhood is very walkable and felt quite safe. I stayed here on business and noticed a few details that others may care about:
- Kitchen equipment is basic; if you plan to cook, be sure to bring essentials like oil, vinegar, and measuring cups (if you need them)! 
- It's on the ground floor.
- Did not get a ton of natural light. (I personally felt uncomfortable fully opening the curtains because people walking by can see inside.)
- Building's wifi was very unreliable; I couldn't use it for work.

The digital code for entry is great. Everything worked and was in good condition. "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful place! So conveniently located and very comfortable!
,,,,,,,,"This is a great 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. If you are in town and need to host a dinner for 6 people, this gets the job done quiet well. We used the kitchen and large dining room table for a Thanksgiving and it worked out smashingly. Lastly, Ryan, and the property manager, Thomas, are a delight. "
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely perfect stay at Ryan's place in downtown Austin. Large condo, perfect for our family of five. Tastefully decorated and furnished, and well appointed (the coffee pods for the Keurig was a nice touch!) Place was very clean. Ryan was super easy to communicate with both before and during our stay. Location is perfect for taking advantage of all that Austin has to offer. Parking was easy and convenient. Highly, highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was super fast and communicative, and answered a few questions I had prior to our booking quickly. His welcome email was super detailed and personal, and gave us all the info we needed. Check in was super straightforward and convenient, which was critical for us as we arrived later in the evening. One of the best rentals I've stayed in! Would absolutely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was in a perfect location, with all the amenities we needed.  Ryan was extremely easy to work with, and very helpful.  Our entire group had a great time, and really enjoyed the apartment."
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed the stay. The only information I missed was that there was only 3 beds. We were 4 guys an therefore had to share a bed. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin- the house was excellent and very comfortably accommodated 5 of us for a college mini reunion weekend. Close to everything but we were still able to park our rental car with no hassle. Ryan was very easy to work with, responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,The place was as described and in an excellent location. Would stay there again.
,,,,,,,,Fantastic property in a fantastic area of a fantastic city.  Thanks very much to both Ryan and Thomas for making the entire experience enjoyable.  We would wholeheartedly recommend this place!  Thanks again.
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was absolutely fantastic to work with. He was extremely welcoming and accommodating to our group. Railyard Oasis is in the perfect location for anyone wanting to experience downtown Austin. It's a short walk to a plethora of excellent dining, shopping, and tourist options. The condo itself is kept in great condition and we felt right at home. We would absolutely recommend and will definitely be coming back for any future trips to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was nice and had everything we needed in terms of washer / dryer and a kitchen. 

It's noisy at night and in the morning due to the street level location. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is in a prime location in Austin. It is a 2 block walk to 6th Street and about a 15 minute walk to Rainey. 
I can't say enough about the location as it is absolutely perfect!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location for both 6th St and Rainey. The space was very clean and uniquely decorated. Kept communication open, and very accommodating to guest request. "
,,,,,,,,Couldn't have been better!
,,,,,,,,"Great place with an incredible location. Everything was clean, accessible, and Ryan was easy to contact during our stay. "
,,,,,,,,Ryan was great to work with and extremely accommodating! 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's quick response was amazing leading up to the trip and the day of checkin. The space was perfect for spending a long weekend girls trip in Austin. It was close to walk to Rainey Street and a quick cab to the east side. There were many great bars nearby and a much needed Starbucks across the street. The pool was tiny, but we met a bunch of other people on group trips, and the smaller pool provided more opportunity for interaction and getting to know some new people. We had a blast!"
,,,,,,,,Had a great time at the Railyard.  Had everything we needed and was in a great location.  The pool was very helpful with our group not being  accustomed to the Texas summer.  Ryan was very helpful and answered any questions we had.  Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"He was incredibly accommodating with my questions and allowing me to enter the condo prior to the 3pm start up time. I highly recommend Ryan and his condo if you're staying in Austin, TX.

Plus the throne chair is very comfortable! "
,,,,,,,,"The location of the apartment is excellent. Easy walk to 6th or South Congress.  Access was easy.  

Ryan is very accommodating.   The apartment had plenty of room with 3 bedrooms.  Very comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location- walking distance to most sights and many restaurants. Host was very accommodating with early check in. Ran into some problems with our requested pack n play, but the host was able to resolve issue quickly. Apartment could be kind of loud at times since it's on the first floor with people walking by all the time (and we had to keep our blinds closed most of the time). That said, great experience overall. "
,,,,,,,,Ryan has an awesome spot here! Beautifully decorated and a perfect location between 6th Street and Rainey (which was important to our group). He also was quick to respond when I had questions about the condo. Austin is a fantastic city and I'd encourage everyone to visit at some point.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was in the center of everything happening in Austin. We were steps away from the convention center, 6th street and Congress. Plenty of restaurants and bars in the area. The rooms were clean and we enjoyed the space tremendously. We would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The Railyard Oasis is perfectly located in Austin. Ryan provided us with a great guide of things to do and see in the city. It was our first visit and we were able to walk almost everywhere as we enjoyed sightseeing, local clubs, restaurants, and shopping. We had an awesome four days with friends and staying in the beautifully decorated Oasis enabled us to spend quality time together and relax before heading out for the evening. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan is as professional as they come. The house is perfect. Just as described. The location couldn't be better. If you have the chance to book this, you will have the best weekend. Coffee shops on all sides of the building, wanderlust yoga across the street, bars and nightlife within walking distance. It doesn't get any better. My only hesitation with leaving such a great review is that when we try to book again, it will be taken. Wonderful experience. "
,,,,,,,,Great location! Great place.  Easy walk over the bat bridge and around south congress
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host. Very quick to respond to any request.
,,,,,,,,"Awesome spot! Location is amazing, right in the middle of the all the hotels and bars downtown and steps away from Starbucks and Yoga! Apartment was clean and beautifully furnished and absolutely perfect for our stay. Quick warning, one of the street-facing bedrooms got a little loud at night when rowdy bar patrons would walk home, but the other two bedrooms were nice and quiet. Really awesome spot--even walkable to Rainey Street!"
,,,,,,,,Super responsive hosts - easy to work with!
,,,,,,,,"Everything was accurate, clean, and tidy.  Location is right near the nightlife on 6th Street, etc."
,,,,,,,,Great location! It is perfect to step out and enjoy the city. Everything is a quick Uber ride away. Ryan was a great host and quickly answered any questions I had. The place was perfect. Great amount of space. Very well put together with some cool decorations.  Strongly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Very nice place, convenient to all of downtown Austin. Unit was clean and comfortable. Ryan was easy to work with and accommodated a last minute request for early access to the rental. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice apartment and well furnished, great downtown location. Host had a very easy check-in and check-out process. Wifi was a little unreliable. Overall a great place to stay, would recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"Once again, Ryan is one of the best host I Once again... had excellent experience with the property and communications with Ryan

Will be staying there again and again!"
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was perfect for our needs. Great location and roomy enough for everyone. Being on the ground floor and the corner, there was some road noise and pedestrians, but really not a big deal.

Kitchen had everything we needed (didn't cook anything, but had coffee). Lots of great restaurants within walking distance. "
,,,,,,,,"This listing was accurate. Ryan made us feel welcome and did all he could to ensure that we were comfortable.  We had a minor hiccup with the apartment to which he responded immediately, efficiently, and with a clear understanding of the importance of having satisfied clients.  I recommend him highly"
,,,,,,,,"Great.
"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and his staff were very accommodating with our travel plans and working around our flights.  The Railyard was in a great location to explore Austin and we could walk almost everywhere.  The unit was nice and met all our needs.  I would definitely recommend it and would like to stay there again in the future!  Thank you!
"
,,,,,,,,"Once again... everything from communication to cleanliness to location was spot on!

In fact, staying at another of his locations in Austin now...

***** rating!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is great, perfect layout and location for a group trip to Austin. We had three couples attending a wedding and everything was great. The location is perfect and Ryan is very helpful and quick to respond to any questions. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Lovely apartment in a great part of town. The place was spacious and well furnished with all the amenities you would need. It is centrally located with a lot of bars and restaurants nearby, and easy to get around town. Ryan was friendly and responsive to any requests. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed staying here..."
,,,,,,,,"Great location in downtown Austin. The condo was easy to check-in/out of, had free private parking, and was close to good places to dine out. Worked great as our home and work place for my co-workers and I. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location, great communication, well appointed! "
,,,,,,,,"I helped to host a girls weekend/bachelorette party for a group of 6 girls.  This was the PERFECT place for our stay.  Very clean and chic, this apartment was big enough for us to all sleep comfortably, and cozy enough for us to feel at home.  It included everything we needed: dishes, towels, pillows, even hair dryers.  

It was also perfectly situated in a great downtown location, and we were able to easily walk to all of the places we wanted to visit on 6th street and beyond.   No  need for cars or pedi cabs for us, but we did notice that a pedi cab would have been easily accessible just outside of our doors.

Check-in/check-out was simple and Ryan and I corresponded before our trip dates.  Between Ryan and Thomas, all my questions were answered, and I was confident that our visit would be seemless.  And it was!  They left descriptive directions that made everything so simple for us.

I would HIGHLY recommend staying here to anyone and will book this apartment again next time I visit.  Ryan has several places on Airbnb within Austin, so I feel confident booking any one of his locations.  If the place has Ryan Windsor's name associated with it, then it's an automatic A+ in my book.

Thanks for the great visit!"
,,,,,,,,"Our host, Ryan exceeded all expectations from the minute we walked into our Railroad Oasis condo.  Not only were his instructions on getting and entering the building helpful and to the ""T,"" the condo was spotless and had amazing amenities! 

Ryan also coordinated with my fiance & property manager, Thomas, to deliver special treats while keeping it a surprise and a seamless transition! 

On top of it all, he accommodated an early and late check in.

He truly was a special part of my bachelorette party and I could not have wished or asked for anything more! "
,,,,,,,,Excellent place!
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely outstanding is how I would describe this property. Located only 1 block from the convention, it was perfect for our Keller Williams event.  The bedrooms each offer queen size beds with memory foam mattresses...........for a perfect nights sleep.  Living room was relaxing and the perfect spot to relax after a long day of education.  Thomas and Ryan are fantastic, easily approachable, and respond quickly.  We will definitely want to stay in the condo again....  Thomas an extra thank you to you for all your assistance. We will be back. "
,,,,,,,,"The candy on the pillows was a nice touch.  The listing was very accurate.  The layout was very nice.  The neighborhood is a great walking neighborhood.  No complaints very easy to work with.  No unreasonable requests, the actual unit has a lot of nice touches, but isn't cluttered.  I would stay here again without even considering other options!"
,,,,,,,,Our stay at Ryan's place was excellent.  He was very responsive and made sure we got set up.  The location is brilliant.  You can't get more central in downtown Austin than this.  The apartment was a spacious 3 bedroom that accommodated 3 business colleagues.  We will definitely try to stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"We had no contact with the host at all. We had requested and were granted an additional night prior to our original arrival date (of which we were most appreciative).  We attempted to call upon arrival the numbers we were provided, but did not receive a call back. Very nicely appointed and obviously a great location."
,,,,,,,,My colleagues and I were very impressed with the suite. Everything is accurate compared to the pictures and it is very central if you need to stay downtown for a conference. Directions were easy to follow and the staff were prompt in their replies. I would happily stay in the unit again in the future and recommend anyone to book when you have a larger party. 
,,,,,,,,The location of this airbnb was great. It's in the middle of DT and close to all the bars on 6th street. Ryan and his team were extremely helpful and went out of there way to accommodate my group's early check-in. I highly recommend staying at this airbnb!
,,,,,,,,"My entire experience from beginning to end working with Ryan and his partners was wonderful. They communicated in a timely fashion in regards to any questions we had prior to and during our stay. They were very accommodating, allowing us to drop off our bags prior to check-in as well as hold our bags for a late check-out. The unit was well maintained and centrally located to everything. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to spend time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The Team (Thomas, Ryan + Jared) where very accommodating.

At the beginning we had a few challenges, 
which were rectified quickly, while we were out of the Apartment.
Only the Ice Cube Maker in the Fridge/Freezer Combi had a Mind of its own & we could not get it to work.

I was staying with two Colleagues, 
who liked the place for its convenience 
of being so close to the Conference Centre - 
literally a stone throw away.
Along with the Starbucks across the Street & the Keurig Coffee Maker in the Kitchen. 
And several Restaurants behind the Condominium. 

Their only Critique Point - 
the patchy slow Internet needs improvement.

Now that Austin becomes a (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Fiber City, 
allowing to register Addresses north of the River in a few weeks,
we hope that this can be fixed soon!
Unfortunately at present it took us a good hour 
to download a half hour long HD Comedy Episode from iTunes.

And large Attachments took also a few Minutes to upload, 
so we resorted to using one of our iPhone's as Mobile Hotspot in combination with our T-Mobile unlimited Plan.

For the Record: 
Ryan offered to provide us with one of his Mobile Hotspots, 
but we declined.

For longer Stays, the front loading Washer & Dryer are a great help.
Along with the small Pool in the Neighbouring Condominium.
We also did not use the Parking Space, 
since the Metro Tram has its Final Stop basically in front of the Door. 
And UBER is so inexpensive to get around town.

Should the Convention come back into town, we would use the Apartment again, because the Location is simply unbeatable!"
,,,,,,,,Plenty of information provided by Ryan and his team. Great location and loved up to the expectations set. Very friendly people and we will use the location again. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and his team were excellent hosts. Everything from the kitchens to the bathrooms/showers and bedrooms was fully stocked when we arrived. They were more than accommodating--going so far as to switch our room to another, larger one when they received a last minute cancellation--and they had many suggestions on what to do and see over our weekend in Austin. Their previous reviews and ratings obviously speak for themselves and their standards."
,,,,,,,,I enjoyed my stay in Austin because of this condo. It was very clean and I had no problems. I highly recommend this condo if you plan to stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Very welcoming. Great experience. Would def stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin. Perfect downtown location, walking distance to most things to do. Ryan was great communicating with us about everything, even accommodating an early check in. Would recommend staying here. "
,,,,,,,,"Great experience, exactly as advertised.  Apartment was spacious and very nice.  The place was quiet despite being centrally located.  Pre-check in email from Ryan was very useful and much appreciated.  Check in/out was super easy."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, decent place. ""Swanky"" is a bit much but certainly a nice complex. Good directions, easy to find and get in.  Nice place to socialize. A couple of nits: Bedrooms facing the street got a little noisy in the wee hours. And It gets tight if you have to use the fourth bed (air mattress). 

Overall satisfied with the experience.  "
,,,,,,,,"The house was great, super clean, and Ryan was such a caring host. The location was walking distance to everything you may need and an Uber ride to West Austin was no more than $7. "
,,,,,,,,"Thank you for all your hospitality.  We enjoyed our stay at your place,  Everything was just as described on your website.  We were close to everything and the weather was beautiful during our stay.  We will be back again someday."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was very responsive and welcoming.  Jared, who met us onsite, helped with storing our luggage on the day we left.  The 3 bedroom condo was clean, beautifully decorated and perfect for us 6 sisters.  Everything was as described and within walking distance to everything.  The airport shuttle worked well for us, arriving and departing on various flights.  The noise from the street could be heard through the walls, but we knew to expect this from the other reviews.  It did calm down after midnight. We give this place 5 stars and would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,Fantastic.  Perfect location for our needs. We had a conference and couldn't have been better.
,,,,,,,,"We rented the apartment for the Austin Marathon weekend. The Railyard Oasis is located a couple of blocks from the starting line so it worked out perfect for us. The apartment itself is super clean, very comfortable, well decorated and equipped as advertised. Very close to the downtown action, which could get a bit noisy at night, but still everybody loved it! Did not need to contact Ryan since everything worked perfectly and his welcome email was very helpful.
Great overall experience."
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location and safe and secure, perfect and clean setup for 3-6 people, and the host was so accommodating and hospitable--they even bought items specifically to make our stay better! We'll definitely be back."
,,,,,,,,Awesome place and great location!!! Park the truck and everything is within walking distance.
,,,,,,,,"This condo exceeded our expectations.   It was beautifully decorated and very well laid out.   We all found the beds to be very comfortable and the linens top quality.    The location is superb and the parking spot is a huge convenience.   As previously noted,  the shuttle to and  from the airport couldn't be any easier and you cannot beat the price. 
Very easy access to building and the condo.   Ryan provides a detailed email with everything you need to know about the condo and about Austin.    Great communication with him.    We look forward to staying here again when we come to Austin to visit my son.     "
,,,,,,,,Great location and the place was amazingly decorated. We were very impressed with the use of space. Everything we needed was available and we felt just like we were at home. We will definitely recommend this place and visit again. Look out for the captain's logs. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's unit in the Railyard Oasis was an excellent place to stay in downtown Austin. I was in town with some colleagues for a business meeting, and the apartment offered very convenient access to both the convention center as well as local food and nightlife.

Everything was very clean and comfortable, and the listing quite accurately set my expectations for what the stay would be like. The style in which the apartment is furnished makes for a fun and interesting environment to spend time.

I would gladly stay here again in the future."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was very easy to work with and responsive. He provided a long detailed email that answered any question we could possibly have. Having washer/dryer was very convenient. The place is really nice, near everything including a B Cycle station (which we used extensively to get around). The yoga studio across the street is pretty amazing. The TV/media setup was a little complicated, but good enough. Overall, a great place to stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's place was perfect!  Great location and very clean.  It could be a bit loud from time to time when neighbors were coming home late night, but the location, cleanliness and overall great hosting were wonderful.  We would definitely stay here again!
"
,,,,,,,,"This was one of the better places in Austin. We had a great time, will come back for sure. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was great! Nicely decorated and great location. The host was quick to respond. 
,,,,,,,,"The Railyard Oasis is great! It was perfect for a girls weekend in Austin. You can't beat the location. We either walked or took Austin B-Cycle's everywhere. Apartment looks exactly as it's pictured â€“ fabulous decor and clean. The door keypad worked out great, as we didn't have to keep track of keys. The $1.50 shuttle from airport drops you right at the condo. The condo community pool was an added bonus for us. Ryan is very responsive and a great host. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,We had a fantastic stay at the Oasis! The condo is beautifully furnished and clean.  The location is hard to beat.  Great communication with Ryan the host and I would definitely recommend this property or any others he manages.  Thank you for making our weekend stress free!
,,,,,,,,"This place was amazing! It looked just as good as the photos and was in a spectacular location. Ryan was great to work with and very responsive, especially during my stay when I had questions regarding the unit. If you are looking to be in a great area in Austin that is walking distance to 6th street then this is your place. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at the Railyard Oasis last weekend.  It was 7 girls out there for a bachelorette party and we couldn't have found a better location.  The apartment is beautiful, clean, spacious and right in the heart of downtown.  Leading up to the trip Ryan was always prompt in getting back to me on any questions I had.  He also let us keep our bags in the apartment past the check-out time since we had a late flight back which was very helpful.  I highly recommend staying staying here."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at the Railyard oasis for my bachelorette party with 5 other girls. There was plenty of space and we absolutely loved it. It was perfectly located and walking distance to all the bars and restaurants. 

The place was clean and easy to access. Ryan was very responsive and helpful, and even made suggestions for bars based on our likes and dislikes. I highly recommend this place, anything better would be hard to come by!"
,,,,,,,,"Was with 4 of my co workers for a conference in Austin. I am so happy we found this gem if a house. It was very clean and spacious, very well stocked with linens. The kitchen is modern and clean. Ryan is also so easy to work with and very helpful. If I am ever back in Austin I will definitely try to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location and decor. Spacious and clean. Ryan was a welcoming and friendly host who attended to all of our needs and questions. Can be loud at night (during SXSW) because it's on the first floor, but that is to be expected during this event. This condo was perfect for what we wanted!"
,,,,,,,,"The railyard oasis was great. The location is impossible to beat and Ryan was fast to respond, friendly, helpful and flexible. Thanks!
"
,,,,,,,,We had a great time in Austin and Ryan's place was absolutely perfect. Close to all the spots downtown and Rainey St. Communication was clear for checking in & checking out.  He's a great host and we'd definitely recommend him!
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is excellently located for the best of Austin! We appreciated easy airport access, 2 blocks off the famed 6th St, and really, walking distance to most everything. We enjoyed a great segway tour from (URL HIDDEN) and used B-cycles to get around some too.  

The apartment was spacious and well appointed, and Ryan was very accommodating and a good communicator.

Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was easy to communicate with. The condo was in a great location, easy to walk to most places. It was clean, furnished very nicely and easy access to the first floor condo. The keypad access to the front door made it easy and convenient."
,,,,,,,,"Place was clean, well-maintained, and a great location. One of the few Airbnbs that actually lived up to the photos, hah.

Definitely would stay here again in the future. Great spot."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location in downtown Austin and the onsite parking was a big bonus!  We hope to stay here again while visiting our UT student.
,,,,,,,,Great spot. Ryan was really helpful.
,,,,,,,,"This condo is amazing! Perfect location and even better than the pictures. If you fly in, take the MetroBus, as it lets you off right on the corner of 4th and Trinity - and it's only $1! Beautiful space, awesome host, and terrific location. Next time we head back to Austin we will DEFINITELY be staying here!

Thank you, Ryan!"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic spot - clean, stylish, plenty of towels :-)
Great location!
Ryan was also very responsive and helpful."
,,,,,,,,"This really is our favorite spot to stay at in Austin. The proximity to everything downtown is second to none. 

Ryan is a great host, and i highly recommend staying in any of his properties. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was the perfect host. When a problem with the previous renter left his condo in need of repair, Ryan immediately notified me and offered up another property (larger and more expensive) at no additional cost. Our group loved the place and had a great time at the condo!"
,,,,,,,,"We are frequent guests of Ryan's properties and always have the peace of mind knowing that our stay will be restful and top notch all the way. 
The Railyard Oasis is a comfortable spot with a convenient location. My group of 4 found found the space extremely accommodating with a very welcoming environment. 

I highly recommend staying at anyone of Ryan's properties because of their quality and his dedication to ensuring that your stay is a restful one. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time staying at the Railyard Oasis in Downtown Austin. It's perfectly located, walking distance from many good restaurants & fun atmosphere. Austin is a great place to visit, and you can not go wrong with this modern, beautifully furnished apartment right in the middle of it all. Ryan was a great host, answered all my questions, and was very helpful in giving advice on restaurants and night life recommendations. 
I'd definitely recommend this location to friends, hopefully I can go visit again in the future. "
,,,,,,,,The Railyard Oasis is the perfect location for a visit to Austin and Ryan was a great host. He was extremely accommodating with our check in time and has definitely made sure that the necessary amenities are available for his guests. We'll definitely be back again!
,,,,,,,,"As a frequent business traveler I appreciate staying in a place that has the comforts of home. My stay at Ryan's condo was just that, a perfect combination of a homey feel with the convenience of a hotel stay. The location gave my group the ability to be centrally located in downtown Austin to be close to everything that the city has to offer.

Ryan was extremely accommodating and made it a point to check in during our stay to make sure it was satisfactory. I definitely recommend both Ryan and his condos to anyone. 

We will be back! "
,,,,,,,,"We had our long overdue man trip over a 4 day weekend and.....  Well the details are classified but we had a ridiculous good time!!!  This place was very nice, clean, and walking distance to any variety of trouble your crew may be looking for ;) Ryan was always just a phone call or text away and was helpful and a good guy.  If you're staying in Austin, stay here....  Keep it real and do it ""Texas Big"" and ""Austin Weird"" while in town!! If someone dies, it'll probably be worth it.  

The pool is small but perfect for chilling and soaking off a hangover...  And what are we, 7?  That we need to do cannonballs???  It reminded me of a Greek bath and I dug it.  Get down there and check it out.  Have fun!!!!"
,,,,,,,,"The Railyard Oasis was perfect - convenient location, spacious, came w/ a parking space, tastefully decorated and well furnished.  Plenty of extra linens and fluffy towels.  The beds are comfy too.  It's nicer than a hotel!!

The best part of our stay was Ryan.  Ryan is a super host.  He is very responsive and welcoming.  Upon our arrival, he helped us w/ our luggage.  He spent some time w/ us touring the condo and introducing himself. Offered to make reservations and suggestions to restaurant.  Throughout my stay he reached out a few times to make sure everything is going well and asked if I needed anything.  It was my friend's bachelorette party, and he even offered to drop off a gift!  It was like having your own personal concierge.  There's no doubt that Ryan is passionate about providing great hospitality.  If you decide to stay here, you'll be in good hands.  Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,The Railyard Oasis condo is fantastic!  Everything you could need is already there and obviously the location is killer.  I will definitely be reserving this place again the next time I'm in Austin and if you are in the area you should too (if you're on the fence just do it!!)
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's place is beautiful, clean, has great amenities, and is perfectly located near everything in Downtown Austin. I would recommend it with no hesitation to my friends and family. We were a group of seven visiting Austin for a May weekend, and we loved having a big apartment to share instead of renting multiple hotel rooms. Ryan was the perfect host. He was extremely responsive leading up to our stay and called us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. I did not meet Ryan, but my friend did, and she thought he was very professional and attentive. Our group of friends travel a lot and have experienced different levels of accommodations, and we were very impressed with the decor and comfort of Ryan's apartment. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Fa-buh-lous.  My 4 friends and I celebrated a long birthday weekend in Austin.  I really can't say enough about our experience.  Ryan is a doll.  The apartment is gorgeous.  It's 2 blocks from the 6th street action.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze.  The condo is on the ground level, but the street noise was minimal.  This was probably my best Airbnb experience yet.  Thanks, Ryan!      "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was a wonderful host- very accommodating for check-in and check-out. He supplied the condo with everything we could need and was always available for anything we needed. The location of the Railyards is perfect - right in downtown Austin, near great restaurants etc. This was perfect for my family. "
,,,,,,,,"The Railyard Oasis is THE PLACE TO STAY in Austin. Ryan is a fantastic host. Every accomodation was made to support our visit. The condo is outfitted with everything you could ask for from a new coffee machine to a Tempurpedic bed. The location is amazing, literally 2 blocks from the main attractions downtown, and a starbucks across the street (key). Ryan is a great host. He is more attentive and ""on the ball"" than any other host I've ever worked with. I can't say enough how great the experience was. I will certainly stay at one of Ryan's properties on my next visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"My first (and certainly not last) trip to Austin was excellent thanks to Ryan and his fabulous condo! The beautifully furnished condo was the perfect size for our group of six. Ryan welcomed us upon our arrival, offered to make reservations for us throughout the weekend, and extended our stay by a few hours so we could leave our bags while taking in some last minute sights. All in all a great experience and preferable to a hotel any day. Highly recommended location, host, and accommodations!"
,,,,,,,,The Railyard Oasis was the PERFECT place to stay in Austin. The location was unbeatable and the accommodations were impeccable! Beautifully designed yet extremely comfortable! Ryan was very accommodating and beyond helpful as well! I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's place was great! Just what we were looking for. The location was perfect. Also Ryan was always in contact and available for any questions or needs we might have, even got us restaurant reservations. Thats going beyond the call of duty!
We will definitely recommend the place to our friends and family.
Thank's Ryan, fo everything."
,,,,,,,,I couldn't have asked for a better location or a better host for my SXSW trip. The condo was beautifully furnished and Ryan was just a phone call away to handle any questions. I would highly recommend his place for a comfortable stay in downtown Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan is everything you'd want in a AirBnB host, and much more. I've stayed in 20+ AirBnBs, and this experience was by far the best. Highly recommend any of his properties to both business and vacation travelers!"
,,,,,,,,"We had an absolutely wonderful experience at the Railyard Oasis.  The location was perfect, a short walk from everything in downtown Austin including 6th street, the river, and Congress Ave.  The place itself had a rustic-chic style, comfortable beds, high water pressure showers, a great stereo/tv and all the amenities of home.  Topping it all off was our host Ryan, he really went all out to assure our experience in Austin was authentic and hassle free.  We were 4 business men travelling together but this place would also be perfect for 3 couples.  We will definitely stay at the Railyard Oasis again on future trips or at one of Ryan's other locations.  Thank you for making our trip to Austin memorable!  "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome weekend, great location, nicely furnished apartment. We were fortunate to be the first guests and the place was a great set up for the weekend. Just a few blocks to everything and Ryan was super helpful about helping us get set up and around the city. "
1125837,4.5,10,9,10,9,10,9,"Our experience visiting Austin was completely made by the accommodations, the location, and the overall ease of coordinating with the owner.  

The location is right near downtown and a short walk to a lot of great restaurants, stores, etc.  Parking was easy for our rental car and getting around from this location was super easy.

The house was immaculate, comfortable, and very well appointed.  Our whole group was way more than happy with our lodging.  

If we ever come back to Austin, we will absolutely reach back out to rent this property again.  Couldn't imagine a better place."
,,,,,,,,"Staying with Kate was a great experience through and through, from her personal emails leading up to the stay to the comfort of her magnificent home.

The house is located within walking distance of Whole Foods and made for easy travel to most of the sites we wanted to visit - we also had no trouble walking between the house and downtown.

Would absolutely recommend this as it easily housed 8 people without it feeling at all crowded!

"
,,,,,,,,This home is fabulous. The location and the neighborhood is unbelievable. We walked to all the bars and restaurants in downtown. Our group of 8 had plenty of room. The enclosed patio is brilliant. Kate was a pleasure to deal with though we did not get to meet her. The neighbor responded to any needs we had. The only minor negatives would be the train horns during the night and no cable or direct tv. Other than that I would highly recommend this home. 
5734832,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Thomas and Urooj are very kind and friendly hosts. They have a lot of suggestions to visit Austin and they are very helpful. The room and the bathroom were very clean and comfortable and there was everything you may need. The house and the condo were beautiful and located in a very good position since the center was easy to reach and also the university. If you travel to Austin I absolutely recommend to stay there.
"
,,,,,,,,"Super hospitable, super clean, gorgeous condo. Great communication. Really appreciated your allowing me to book at the last minute. They made my stay in Austin easy and trouble free. A beautiful place to stay, truly, and very gracious hosts. Really appreciated the bottled water. If you are looking for a classic, safe private room to stay with great amenities, this is the place. "
,,,,,,,,Thomas was a great host. He was very knowledgeable about Austin and directed me to some good restaurants. He is a good conversationalist and enlightened me on the happenings in Austin. The bed was very comfortable and the house was clean.   
,,,,,,,,"Thomas' place was very nice, clean, welcoming and  great communication. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, easy access to unit itself "
,,,,,,,,Thomas and Urooj were friendly and accommodating hosts. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful stay at Thomas' condo and he and his fiancÃ© were more than accommodating and very kind! Perfect location, very nice and clean home, and were so helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"Thomas and Urooj were extremely accommodating and personable. Their apartment is in the perfect location, right in downtown Austin. You are only minutes away from the capital and east 6th street when you stay here! You have a private bedroom and bathroom which are both very clean. 

There are cats in this apartment so if you are allergic this may not be your place. Also there is no parking and you do have to pay for parking on the weekends! Make sure you get up early to fill that meter at 8 am or else you will get ticketed. 

Thomas and Urooj were very helpful when my boyfriend lost his phone and have been in communication with us about it even after we left -- So thank you! 

Definitely a good place to stay for a weekend in Austin, super central to everything. "
,,,,,,,,"Thomas and his Wife were very Open and Friendly., very accommodating. This was our first time staying in a home while the host resided there at the same time, so we were really nervous.. But they went out of there way to make us feel Welcomed. We also had some complications on our part and they were really understanding and did everything they could to help us. Thank y'all so much for a Great Experience! "
,,,,,,,,Thomas is a fantastic host - genuinely welcoming and kindly accommodating.  His condo is beautiful and modern and the neighborhood is charming and in close proximity to downtown (but still easy to find parking). My full experience was met on every level with grace and comfort and it would be my distinct pleasure to book another stay here.
,,,,,,,,It's was a great first time experience.. Everything you want to do in Austin with in 10 mins ... Bring your motorcycle and park anywhere...  Beautiful view of downtown and located on a main road to get anywhere you want... Minutes from 6th street... Loved the whole experience... 
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was an incredible host.  He made me feel very welcome (he left a welcome basket on the bed with recommendations of things to do and bottled water) and is a super friendly guy.  The condo itself was immaculate.  I couldn't think of a better location either, with great access to all the best spots in town.  I would highly recommend staying at his place over a hotel to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"Thomas and Urooj's condo was beautiful and the location was great. Parking in the area, however, is sparse and expensive. Thomas was helpful in pointing out the couple of the free spots available and also provided great recommendations for close by gyms and BBQ. They also have two super sweet and friendly cats."
,,,,,,,,Very nice place. Sweet tv setup and comfortable accommodations. Thomas is very kind and helpful. 
,,,,,,,,"Good host, very nice place. Nice amenities including balcony and entertainment center.  Quick communication and helpful basket full of water bottles, guidebooks and tip sheets. Recommended."
,,,,,,,,"We were certainly made welcome by our friendly hosts. This was notable in several ways. Some examples -- nice relaxing chatting as we shared a meal in the kitchen; joining Thomas to watch a movie; and especially taxiing us around when a crazy event occurred that resulted in a trip to an Austin ER. The condo is superb and is designed perfectly for an AirBnb set up no matter whether the hosts are present when the guests are or not. Special attention has been taken by hosts to make things comfortable and home-like. A nice umpteen channel HD TV in the guest bedroom. A private bath with over-sized shower for guests. Location is very near downtown, but not exactly there. Instead it has a neighborhood feel. It's near enough the UT-Austin campus to have a campus feel, but without the super congestion if you were much closer. We've been visiting Austin twice a year for about 5 years and it certainly would have been nice to find this place earlier than we did."
,,,,,,,,Comfortable room on the edge of campus.  Perfect for a weekend around central Austin and downtown.  
,,,,,,,,"Lovely apartment and Thomas was a super-friendly and thoughtful host, even leaving a welcome package in the room (bottled water, information on the city and events). "
,,,,,,,,"I cannot adequately express how wonderful my trip was! Thomas was warm, welcoming, helpful, and his home was a joy to stay in. I'll definitely be coming back!"
,,,,,,,,La hospitalidad fue excelente. La habitaciÃ³n perfecta y el baÃ±o estupendo. Todo funcionÃ³ a la perfecciÃ³n. La ubicaciÃ³n del departamento es inmejorable. A 10 minutos a pie de la University of Texas y a 20 minutos a pie de la Sixth St. y del downtown. El sistema de cerradura con clave para acceder al departamento evitÃ³ tener que manejar una llave y me dio absoluta independencia. 
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was an excellent host. He and his girlfriend welcomed me and showed me around when I arrived. Everything was as advertised. The bedroom, bathroom, and closet were spacious and well appointed.

Bonuses:
- uVerse TV in the guest room let me keep up with sporting events I cared about
- they left me a care package of water, a visitor guide, and a couple of other essentials when I arrived
- housekeeper arrived one of the days and kept everything fresh
- Two adorable kitties kept me company a couple of times.

The apartment is about a ten minute walk from the SW corner of UT. I personally thought that was perfect for getting a little exercise each day without having to plan for a long trek. Of course, UT is huge, so I suppose it depends on what part of campus you need.

Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,Thomas is a great host.Very friendly and he took good care during my stay.His condo is neat and two cats are super friendly.I highly recomment him to anyone looking for a place in Austin
,,,,,,,,Thomas was a great host. Very friendly guy. Accommodating. The condo was nice and located in a great area. 
,,,,,,,,great place
,,,,,,,,Great! 
,,,,,,,,"The guest room and bath are accurately described.  They're in an attractive, modern building that is within walking distance of the University and restaurants. The building is quiet and feels safe.  The hosts were friendly and helpful without being intrusive.    "
,,,,,,,,Thomas was a great host!! The listing was described perfectly. His residence was terrific felt like I was staying in a 5 star hotel. Thomas had a welcome packet with helpful information and was great at explaining all of the transit access I had during my stay. I would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,Thomas sent me detailed instructions and left a welcome package with helpful info. The place is located strategically close to campus and with a walking distance from many restaurants. Room was clean as described in the picture. Thomas was very friendly and hospitable. 
,,,,,,,,"This listing was wonderful! Thomas sent me all the check-in information and got my code set up before I arrived, so checking in was a breeze. He kindly checked to make sure I got in ok, and the suggestions for things to do and places to eat was a great addition.
   The apartment is exactly as pictured, with a wonderful balcony view and modern, clean space. It is perfectly located in a safe area, close to downtown and UT. The room is adorable and perfect for a vacation or quick business trip. The bed is one of the comfiest places I have ever slept! And the two kitties are great. Even with a minor cat allergy, the apartment was so well-kept that I did not have a single problem. I am a rather private person, and Thomas respected that while making me feel welcome at the same time. I would highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,Great experience- would love to stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was a great host, extremely friendly and helpful with all things Austin.  The condo is exactly as advertised, extremely comfortable and clean.  Perfect place to stay if you are visiting the University.  "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay with Thomas. The condo was new, clean, and a great location close to downtown and campus.

Thomas was always quick to answer any questions I had. Parking was on the street in front of the complex, but I never had a problem finding a parking space.

I will definitely try to stay here again the next time I come to Austin. Thanks Thomas!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was expected. Awesome bed and shower , great location. Would recommend to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was an exceptional host and everything was as advertised. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and in a great location. I was in Austin for some UT events and could easily walk to campus. Thomas was very helpful with suggestions on where to go out to eat and see Austin's nightlife. I would stay here again and highly recommend it to others!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a great time staying here. I had a conference at the AT&T Center and it was perfect walking distance. It only took me about ten minutes. They have a code on the door to the building of their condo and also their front door, making it very convenient to come and go whenever I needed. They were both very kind, and even gave me fresh baked cookies which were delicious. As a single woman staying with a couple, I felt very safe. The bathroom and bedroom were very nice and clean. I would definitely stay here again if I was going to downtown Austin by UT Austin. Thanks guys! "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was just as promised.  The descriptions and other reviews are spot on. 
Thomas and Uroojâ€™s place is a great location with nice views (4th floor),  The bedroom has a firm bed with high quality sheets, not to mention cable TV, DVD player, and Apple TV.  There is a private bathroom with awesome shower and nice towels.  Convenient keyless entry, you pick the code.  They also have a couple of cats that are quite sociable."
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was a very welcoming host. He went out of his way to make me feel comfortable. The apartment is exactly as listed, more like a fancy hotel experience for half the price. This is a high-scale, very safe area. The Uber ride to downtown is about $5, and Uber works really good. Toby and Rani were sweet feline companions. "
,,,,,,,,"Just as advertised, the apartment is lovely and clean, and the bed/bedding/pillows are all hotel quality and comfortable. Bathroom right next to the room makes it feel like you're staying in your own place. Thomas was a great host, and had good recommendations for things to do in the area."
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was very welcoming when we arrived. He gave us a list of recommendations for Austin Things to Do/visit as well as everything needed including towels and water. We loved the keyless entry (very convenient) and their cats, Ronny and Toby, are the cutest!"
,,,,,,,,"Host was extremely welcoming, and this is a very nice unit in an extremely convenient location"
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was a delightful host. I arrived quite late and it was easy to get into the condo, and the room was prepared for me. The condo was very clean and quiet. It is convenient to downtown, with many bus routes stopping nearby, and also to the university. Thomas was friendly and offered advice about what to do in my limited free time. I recommend Thomas's place, and I would stay there again if my travels take me back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was a great host and the place was immaculate. Everything was very clean and welcoming.

The bottles of water were a great touch!"
,,,,,,,,"Great, friendly host. Place was nice and clean with pretty good AV set up too"
,,,,,,,,"Thomas made us very most welcome he even had a list printed out of resturants and places and things to do, a lovely jesture of bottled water and towels were left on our bed."
,,,,,,,,"My stay here was great.  The apartment is really nice and clean and they had a list of things to do/places to eat in the area.  The neighborhood is nice and close to the university, the capitol, lots of places to eat, etc.  I was out for most of the day during my stay and only ran into Thomas and Urooj once, but they were both pretty nice and hospitable.  Definitely recommend."
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I stayed at Thomas' condo for a long weekend in October. Thomas was very responsive in the days/weeks leading up to the visit and provided a detailed description of how to get to his place as well as a welcome packet when we arrived that contained all the necessary info for our stay (e.g., wifi passwords, TV instructions, local attractions, etc.). He was very accommodating and provided some recommendations while we were there of some local places to eat/drink. 

Overall, the condo worked out perfectly. The condo is centrally located and we had a rental car for which we were able to easily find parking (just be sure to note the various parking restrictions on Austin's streets). There is a private bathroom essentially en-suite and he has a programmable lock so no need to carry around an extra set of keys. We would definitely stay here again if/when we come back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Thomas  was a great host. He tried his best to make us feel at home. The room was comfortable & a private bathroom was convenient. The whole place is a very nice, and the location is good for the Capitol and U of Texas. You can get a day pass(good for 24 hours) for the bus and metro for $2.50 each. There're the B-bike Austin bike sharing program stations within 5-6 blocks, and it is a great way to explore Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"El cuarto de Thomas estaba extremadamente limpio junto con el baÃ±o y todo el departamento. Nos dejo un detalle de bienvenida, ideas de que hacer mientras estÃ¡bamos en Austin, restaurantes, etc. Siempre nos contesto a tiempo los mensajes y no tuvimos ningÃºn problema  a la hora de llegar. Definitivamente buscarÃ­a quedarme aqui otravez si vuelvo a ir a Austin. La ubicaciÃ³n esta excelente, cerca de la 6ta."
,,,,,,,,"Thomas was a fabulous host! He kept in touch via text when we arrived in Austin, gave detailed instructions on getting to and into his condo, and recommended a fun street fair that was happening the afternoon we arrived. He even left beer in the fridgeâ€“a nice touch. The neighborhood is beautiful, and very close to the capital building and UT; the condo complex is lovely. Our bed had a nice welcome package, including a list of recommended restaurants and things to do. When we returned from our evening, Thomas and his girlfriend warmly welcomed us. I would stay stay at his condo again."
,,,,,,,,It was a good experience.  Thomas was very nice and accommodating.  The room was very clean and nice.  The bedroom was a tad too hot for our liking due a lack of bedroom curtains to block out the Texas sun.  Overall a great experience.
,,,,,,,,"The condo was very clean and modern, the location was perfect, and Thomas was very friendly and hospitable. "
,,,,,,,,Great place and location. Nice People. Convenient to campus. 
,,,,,,,,"Comfy, clean and quiet room in a convenient location - walkable to shops, restaurants and the university precinct.

The location is excellent, very quiet but all downtown attractions are within a comfortable walk or a short Uber ride. The apartment and the building itself exceeded all my expectations, they are extremely nice and high-class - I don't remember the last time I had stayed in such a fancy place! It's extremely orderly, clean and finely furnished. The bedroom was very nice too, very tidy and prepared beyond hotel standards. Thanks Thomas!

The flawless accommodation was a significant part of my first trip to Austin leaving a very favorable impression!"
,,,,,,,,"Tom was a great host! My husband and I were passing through Austin for just one night and had never been. Tom was kind enough to write us a list of ""must dos"" and his suggestions were ON POINT! We had a fantastic time in the few hours we spent there. Not to mention, his place was very clean, well decorated, and in a great part of town (very safe, and close to lots of entertainment). The balcony had spectacular city views. One of the greatest features of his place was that he programed our own individual passcode for his front door, so there was no need to deal with keys or complicated entrance issues. The accommadations included a room equipped with a comfortable queen-sized bed, Apple TV, and a full bathroom. We'd definitely stay there again if we could!"
15024563,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"We absolutely loved this place! Cozy & chiÄ‡ & right in the heart of downtown Austin. The condo itself was amazing! The decor, the ambiance. I live outside of Austin & will definitely stay there again! Also everyone in the building was so friendly! Check in & check out was super easy! Two thumbs way up! "
,,,,,,,,"The accommodations were great. The condo was super clean and in impeccable shape. Loved the location right in the heart of down town, on the water, easy to come and go and close to everything."
14090676,,9,10,10,10,10,10,"Karensa was awesome she showed us the house and was very available to answer any questions that we had.   Location was perfect, house was clean and we had more than enough towels, etc.  would stay again for sure"
,,,,,,,,"The house was awesome. Spacious, clean, relatively cheap, and in an outstanding location."
2336183,5,10,10,10,9,10,9,"Awesome place, quiet part of the city yet very close to the 6th St and Rainy St where all the fun is, try out Iron Works BBQ(great authentic BBQ, walking distance). The place is very cleand and organized just like in the pics. The host Beto is very helpful and answers any questions promptly. Would certainly book again."
,,,,,,,,Great communication and smooth entry procedures. Also nice that parking on the side street was available and nearby.

,,,,,,,,Loved my stay at Beto's place. An incredible location (close to everything) and the apartment is super nice. Beto was a great host -- very responsive and made everything easy. Just a great experience all around.
,,,,,,,,A fantastic apartment in one of Austin's most unique and treasured neighborhoods.  Beto was extremely helpful and made our stay really seamless.  
,,,,,,,,"This place was a last minute replacement on airbnb, so we are giving the host the benefit of the doubt on it being short notice.  It was a nice enough place, but the rate was $33.00 more per night than currently advertised ($119/night).  Overall, communication was good by the host; however, no instructions were left on using any of the 3 remotes for the tv and sound system, and no instructions on accessing wifi code.  Not a big deal, as we were out sight-seeing most of the time.  Kitchen area was good; however, there were already dirty dishes in the dishwasher, so we washed any dishes & cooking utensils by hand. Although we did enjoy walking to a couple of the restaurants, the location is not the best if you are an early sleeper/early riser.  The apartment is catty-corner from a bar that had an open-air concert the first night we were there! The crowing roosters at 5:30 in the morning were actually nice to hear! Otherwise, this place works, in a pinch!"
,,,,,,,,Everything about my trip to Austin was amazing- and Beto's apartment was one of the main contributors to our experience. With a location just a 10-15 minute walk to 6th street and downtown it allowed us to see and do everything we wanted to in our weekend there. His apartment was beautiful with tons of space and was extremely clean. TONS of free parking around the apartment-don't let this be a deterrent from staying here. Beto was also extremely responsive and helpful before and throughout our stay- making our check in/check out procedure painless. 10/10 would recommend staying here! Appreciate the place man.
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place. Beto was responsive and friendly, and the apartment is classy and clean. The location is incredible. Just legit all around. Thanks man!"
,,,,,,,,I enjoyed my stay at Beto's hospitable apt. The pictures accurately reflect the space--a good practice/standard not always upheld by other hosts. Overall I had a seamless and comfortable stay! Unfortunately he displays Cardinal pride and I'm a Trojan...
,,,,,,,,"Beto is a great host. Although he was not present during my stay, he responded to my emails almost immediately and made me feel well supported. He explained the process for entry to his apartment, as well as the parking situation. His instructions were concise and everything was just as he described. 

Beto's apartment was also just as he described: clean, comfortable with a contemporary decor aesthetic. If you are a musician, you will love Beto's place. You will find instruments in almost every room and many music venues are just blocks away. The kitchen is stocked with the essentials and his bedroom provided the comfort I needed. 

This location is great! I used to live in this neighborhood 11 years ago. It was great to stay in my old ""hood."" Beto's apartment is located in the heart of Austin's East Side. There are many excellent restaurants, 3rd wave coffee shops and bars just steps away from the apartment. Downtown Austin is just a few blocks away. His location is optimal for the true Austin experience. 
"
,,,,,,,,"We really loved our stay at Beto's apartment! It was central to everything, clean, and accommodating. Beto was easy to reach, and replied quickly to any questions. We would definitely stay there again for a future trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Beto was terrific!  He was responsive and helpful.  His apartment is clean and a great place for an Austin trip :)
,,,,,,,,"Had a fantastic experience here - very comfortable apartment, close to everything you want to experience, and great communication with Beto. Highly recommended, I wish I could've stayed longer. "
,,,,,,,,Great experience in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"totally laid back and good experienced. just met beto when we checked in and he was on his way out. good guy, clean flat ... just as described and as expected. the neighourhood is also easy going. make sure you try the brasilian food truck just up the road on corner E 7th Street"
,,,,,,,,Beto was very welcoming and he's a great communicator! The apartment was just like he described and couldn't have been in a better location. We were able to get a good night's sleep and get to all of the places we wanted to see without going very far. I would highly recommend his place to anyone wanting comfy accommodations close to the Austin scene. 
,,,,,,,,"Beto was an excellent host! I loved that he was extremely flexible with arrival and departure times. His place was awesome and very centrally located. Uber rides were super cheap and quick. Overall, would recommend Betos place and would even stay again. "
,,,,,,,, Great Central Location
,,,,,,,,"Beto's place was great!  It's located in a really cool part of the East Side: great restaurants, farmer's market, close to downtown, etc.  

Beto was a great host.  He was very accommodating and provided nice amenities, such as beverages and digital entertainment (AppleTV and ChromeCast). 

The place itself was great.  Very clean,  modern and cozy.  One feature/drawback, depending on your perspective, is that the apartment is caddy corner to an outdoor music venue.  We we there Saturday night, and it got a little loud.  Not enough that it impacted our stay, but those who have kids or have a hard time sleeping should take it into consideration. "
,,,,,,,,"Beto was an ideal host - easy to contact, quick to respond and helpful throughout. His place is lovely and very spacious, pictures don't quite do it justice, and also in the perfect location for exploring Austin - only a short walk downtown and with a variety of brilliant coffee, food and drink in the surrounding area. Street parking was readily available, even though we arrived late on a Friday night. I would not hesitate to recommend his place."
,,,,,,,,"Beto's apartment was decorated as listed - modern. The location was very convenient but parking was limited on a weekend night as you are walking distance from the restaurants and bars in East Austin. Overall, apartment was clean and we had a nice weekend. "
,,,,,,,,"I was blown away by how nice Beto's apartment was. The moment you walk in you can tell he takes very good care of his place. Location couldn't have been more perfect in Austin, just walking distance from restaurants, a concert venue and cute coffee shops. Beto had toiletries available and the towels were very fresh. I would most definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Beto was very helpful and communicative. His place is exactly as described and was clean and tidy. A great place. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,"Beto's place is exactly as described and the photos show a true likeness - it's spacious with a good equipped kitchen, a big bathroom and good sized bedroom. Unfortunately we were only staying one night however you could easily spend longer here as it has everything you need. The location was an easy walk to 6th too with lots of bars and great places to eat. Thanks Beto!"
,,,,,,,,Beth's place was in a great location and there's plenty of stuff to walk to or take a short uber ride. He also was able to recommend a couple of good places to eat/hangout. Would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Beto was a gracious host and his place was immaculate. It's located in a great spot with a lot of fun bars and restaurants within walking distance. Overall, a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Listing description and photos were accurate. Host was communicative before and during stay. Location was centrally located if you want to go to Rainey, West & East 6th (~10 minute walk to all). Apartment was super clean and very welcoming, overall a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Beto's apartment was very clean, organized and comfortable. The check in was easy and smooth. We never personally met Beto, but he replied to questions or emails quickly and alerted us to check out times, etc. 

The apartment is great for a couple. There is a great speaker system to play music from your iPhone/computer and TV had Apple TV, Netflix etc. 

The location of this place is AMAZING. East Austin is so much fun and this place was close to every bar, coffee shop and restaurant we wanted to go to. I can't stress enough how good this location is. Across the street is a very cool bar with a food truck, live music, outdoor seating, corn hole, jenga, and old movies screening.  

The only downside of this place was the last day having an early fire drill, however I know this wasn't controllable.  

I would recommend this place for a couple that wants to be in east Austin! 
"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed 1 night in Beto's place in Austin and the apartment was very comfortable, clean and nice. The neighborhood was fantastic with a great nightlife atmosphere! The description of the offer fits exactly to the reality and to our expectations. We really enjoyed staying in Austin! Thanks Beto for all. We strongly recommend this place. "
,,,,,,,,"Yes--Beto was awesome. We didn't get to meet, but he responded quickly to all questions and the apartment is exactly as listed. Very clean. I'd definitely stay there again. Super close to East Austin bars and Rainey. A++

"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is excellent and well kept, very clean. The area (east side) has heaps of great food trucks, bars and restaurants in walking distance. Beto was able to be contacted and very reasonable about check in / check out times. All in all I highly recommend Austin, the East side and Beto's apartment! "
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience here!
,,,,,,,,"Beto was a great host making sure I had all the information I needed about his place!  As a former Austin resident, this is the up and coming area in Austin.  It is a great location to many places and worked perfectly for this trip!"
,,,,,,,,"This place is in a beautiful historic neighborhood of Austin. Downtown is about a 15-20min walk max, or Uber X is everywhere as well as pedi cab's to take back from 6th Street in downtown. Beto has great taste and the apartment is very comfortable and spacious for a 1 bedroom. I will not hesitate to stay here again, thanks so much."
,,,,,,,,"The trip was good, the apartment is in a great location for walking to bars and a few other places (yoga). The apartment was very clean, overall, although it looked like the bathtub was missed. Otherwise, it was a good, comfortable stay. I'd stay with Beto again."
,,,,,,,,This my first experience with Airbnb and it was really great! The apartment was clean. Beto was able to give good suggestions for places to go and was flexible about check in and check out times. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic AirBnB, perfect location. Amazing neighbourhood: live music, food trucks and great bars 5 mins away from the front door. Description was completely accurate. Very clean apartment, very easy key pick-up, very comfortable. Parking is easy too, even on a Friday/Satruday night. Airplay linked to the stereo system was a nice bonus."
,,,,,,,,Beto was great! Really nice & always available for questions. He made me feel really welcomed!
,,,,,,,,"Beto's place on East 4th was great for our trip! The apartment was clean and just like it looks in the pictures.  Beto was flexible with check-in/check-out. Street parking was pretty easy to find.  Communication was smooth and Beto was quick to respond to messages. I'd note that there's a bar located diagonally from the complex, so it was noisy until 1am, but if you're planning on going out anyway, it shouldn't be a problem! We actually walked from Rainey Street to the complex, so that ended up being super convenient.  There were also coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance, so we took advantage of that. Would definitely recommend!  
"
,,,,,,,,The listing was better than expected. I would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"beto's place was awesome. a great location, clean, with all amenities. walkable to 6th street."
,,,,,,,,"Beto and he place were great! I had a really great stay. He was completely accommodating and everything was as he said it would be.  The apartment was great. Great location and great place in general. I have to say, the bed was really comfortable and everything was really nice yet relaxed feeling. The pictures are really accurate and actually maybe don't do it quite justice if anything.I would recommend this to anyone. Thanks Beto!"
,,,,,,,,"Beto's place was so much more amazing than the photos convey. Exceptional Host and when contacted, promptly replied. Great location as well."
,,,,,,,,"This space is really nice for the price and has a great location as well. It was very clean, and super easy to check in and out. I'd recommend it to other folks visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Beto's apartment is amazing (even better than the pictures), everything was super clean, convenient location, easy check in and check out, everything was perfect, one of my best Airbnb experiences! "
,,,,,,,,"Beto's place was great! It was clean, plenty close enough to the light rail and downtown for our NYE plans, with tons of places to eat within walking distance."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is pretty great. It's large and spacious, and in a very nice location, close to all the cool places in the east side."
,,,,,,,,"Beto and his apartment were great!  We arrived late Wednesday night before Thanksgiving and found the apartment easily.  The apartment itself was so nice and comfortable-- exactly what we'd expected from his photos and description!  The kitchen was great, the bed comfortable, and he even had little toiletries available in the bathroom in case we forgot anything!  

We spent a lot of time exploring the city, which is not too far from his place (we walked a lot, and used Lyft too, which was a really reasonable option!).  Additionally, there is a fun bar right across the street and coffee shops and restaurants really close by too.  

This was our first time using Airbnb and Beto made it an easy and enjoyable experience.  I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location Metro Rail right there, very nice new apartment quick responses and everything I needed was there, would stay there again"
,,,,,,,,Very new and clean apartment. It was a very smooth process and the location is great seeing as though it's only minutes from downtown. I would recommend booking through Beto on your next visit to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, and great apartment. Definitely recommend to anyone."
,,,,,,,,"Right away, I want to say that the pictures do not do this apartment justice.  The apartment was great.  Wood floors and a nice kitchen,  awesome location in the local hotspot, and very close to everything downtown.  Beto maintained the apartment very well and was a grey host.  He and I were in constant communication the entire trip, sometimes just to check in and make sure everything was well.  I would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone."
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in Austin. Very comfortable and it's in walking distance to everything I came to Austin for. I will be staying here again when I visit Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Great stay for a great rate. Very clean. Good location. Did not personally meet the host but communication was clear and received quick responses. Overall good experience.
,,,,,,,,Beto was a great host and he was quick to respond to any messages. The apartment is in a great location. Everything was very clean. Would definitely stay again.
921018,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great, cozy home away from home, especially during a week as crazy as SXSW. Raina and Aaron are very easy to communicate and coordinate with. Would love to come back! "
,,,,,,,,"Raina and Aaron were fantastic hosts. Raina welcomed me with their adorable kids. Got me set up and showed me everything. The house is perfectly located for SXSW. Has a great kitchen, yard and comfortable bedrooms. Everything had it's place and is very well designed. Lovely home. "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful home just 10 minutes walking distance from the center of town. Great place to hang out during SXSW! Comfortable beds, fully equipped kitchen, laundry facilities, and even a cute little cat that hangs out around the house. Overall, extremely clean and convenient. Raina was super responsive as well and had everything ready for us upon arrival. Two thumbs up!!"
,,,,,,,,"Raina & Aaron's house was an absolutely perfect home base during SXSW-- just a few short blocks away from all of the action, which in the past few years has increasingly moved east of the highway. Tucked quietly away on a side street just off E. 7th, it's totally isolated from all the noise, which adds to its already restful vibe. The house has two spacious bedrooms (both with incredibly comfortable beds), plus a bright living room and dining area, a huge backyard with fire pit, and even a cozy hammock in front. And whether you're staying for SXSW or just visiting Austin, the location is perfect with endless options for restaurants, groceries, and nightlife a few blocks to both the north and south. 

Aaron was an incredibly gracious and hospitable host, walking us through the place upon our arrival, and responded promptly via text to the few questions we had during our stay. I actually wish I lived here full time. I couldn't recommend it more highly."
2189386,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,This is a great unit and a perfect location. The buildings amenities felt like a high end hotel and the hosts were very accommodating. We had a blast at Formula 1.
,,,,,,,,Place was great? Justin was very flexible. Let us have a late check out. Right in downtown Austin. Few blocks from 6th. Highly recommended
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood is great, description was spot on and the condo itself was larger than expected. The fitness center in the building was also better than your average buildings fitness center. I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Very convenient apartment. Slight misunderstanding on the location of the apartment but it was promptly resolved.

Would stay again next time in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Justin was always there to help.   The apartment is in a great location and has excellent views.  It was walking distance to almost everything we did in Austin.  The pool and gym were perfect.  Will definitely stay there again.
,,,,,,,,Listing was exactly as described - lovely flat and really enjoyed our time there. 
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place!  Fantastic host!  Rent this place is you want a nice apartment close to the center of Austin.  This was my best airbnb experience to date.  Not only was the apartment big and clean, but the host (Justin) pulled out all of the stops to make this as easy a process as possible and threw in his own luxurious touches.  Justin added an extra bed specifically for our group.  He made getting into the apartment super easy and was responsive the entire time.  On top of this he left us a nice gift upon arrival, had new towels, soaps, etc. and even had chocolates and slippers for each guest.  Just straight awesome!  Thank you so much Justin."
8253891,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"I feel like you can't ask for a more awesome host and home, my wife and I had a great stay and would recommend to friends!"
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful place and unexpectedly great location! So close to UT campus and downtown. Great cafe, coffee shop, and contemporary Mexican restaurant just around the corner, within walking distance. Although I didn't get to meet Cindy since she was out of town, she made sure we knew how to get in the Cozy Tiny House. The Cozy Tiny had everything we could have possibly needed for our short stay, with kitchen needs and any extras. We are definitely coming back."
,,,,,,,,Cindy was an EXCELLENT host and her tiny house was a lot of fun to stay in!
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was such a gracious host.  She was very communicative before we got there and throughout the weekend.  She met us when we arrived and supplied extra dog beds and water & food bowls for my two dogs.  The Tiny Cozy is definitely tiny and cozy, but exactly what we were looking for!  The house is centrally located in Austin and easy to many parts of the city.  It was definitely a treat!  We would stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"As many other reviews have stated, this is a very well equipped 'tiny house' in a wonderful neighborhood.  The place is cared for and it shows.  Cindy was a very welcoming and gracious host, and even walked me around the neighborhood to introduce the coffee shop and local restaurants.  I didn't have a car and it was fine in this area with options for walking, car2go, and rideshare always available.  It's ideal for a single person or a couple that doesn't mind a tight space.  Good internet connection.  
Thanks Cindy! "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place to stay to explore central Austin on foot. There are some great restaurants and a lovely coffee shops just steps from your door. Easy walk to Whole Foods and shopping through a nice neighborhood. 

Cindy was really welcoming and provided drinks and snacks for her guests to enjoy. Great host!

I was there during thunderstorms and high humidity so was unable to enjoy the patio. Probably also due to the wet weather, the place felt a bit damp and had a moldy smell. "
,,,,,,,,I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking to check out the entertaining city of Austin. There is a diversity of restaurants in the immediate area. It's very close to Zilker Park and Barton Springs. Just a quick ride will get you to the main drag. Cindy was probably the best host I've encountered so far. The orientation she gave upon my arrival was a special touch.  The Tiny-Cozy has everything you need. Great for a single occupant or for couples that plan to be out and about all the time (you will be).
,,,,,,,,"Cindy is an awesome host.  Her place was perfect for our stay.  The location is great - short ride to downtown and the neighborhood is quiet with super easy access to a few restaurants, coffee shop, convenience store, etc..  

Thanks Cindy!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was a terrific host and the space is perfect! It's great for two people who just need a base of operations and a bed, but Cindy also went the extra mile with thoughtful extras (an iron and ironing board, a fridge and microwave, toiletries you might have forgotten to pack, delicious snacks, etc.) so it's a really nice place to chill out too. Very convenient location to boot. One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had!"
,,,,,,,,"There are no words to describe the magical place called the Cozy Tiny other than the space was absolutely perfect and our host, Cindy, was the cherry on top!  In all my years of using this service, this was by far the best experience yet!  Not only was Cindy an amazing host but she's now a welcomed friend!  Her energy of spirit, kindness, and her servants heart resonates from her own space to the Cozy Tiny.  The weekend couldn't have been more perfect!  I can't forget to mention the amazing restaurants, shopping, and coffee shop all within walking distance which makes this place even more worthwhile for any visitor.  If in Austin, there is no place I'd rather stay and if I could give her and the Cozy Tiny 100+ thumbs up I would!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Cindy's Cozy Tiny House was my first Airbnb experience and I'm pretty sure it won't be topped! The accommodations were fantastic and Cindy was just awesome! She really went way above and beyond to make sure that we had a great stay.  Our expectations were exceeded in every way. Thanks for spoiling us Cindy! In the future when I'm in Austin, I'm checking to see if Cindy's Cozy Tiny House is available!"
,,,,,,,,Very convenient location. Cindy was very thoughtful and the tiny house had all the necessities plus more. Cindy is very thoughtful. Our stay was comfortable and we appreciated her recommendations. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Cindy had tons of suggestions leading up to the trip, and was constantly available by text and phone throughout our stay in Austin. The house itself was tiny (as promised!) but for anyone looking for a clean, cozy place to stay and to get out and explore the city, it was great. The bathroom was very clean and updated/modern. The AC and TV worked well. Cindy also provided a mini-fridge with refreshments for those hot days in Austin. The street was quiet and we slept so well. Everything went smoothly, Cindy was very flexible, the house was perfect for what we needed."
,,,,,,,,"The cozy tiny house was wonderful, and Cindy was a great host. The house is neatly decorated, clean, and in a fun neighborhood that is still quiet and accessible. We had a great time, and would stay again if we came back."
,,,,,,,,"There's a lot of love and thoughtfulness put into this cozy tiny house in Clarksville and it shows from the second you step foot into your dreamy patio until the moment you sadly have to go. Cindy is an amazing host and has equipped the house with everything you could possibly need and more! If you're lucky enough to stay here you'll enjoy a super comfy bed, beautiful furnishings, lounging in your private patio, and easy strolls to some of the best restaurants, shops and nightlife in Austin. Don't be worried about the small space .. the layout is ingenious and comfortably accommodates a single or couple. You won't feel like you're staying in a tiny house but rather, that you're right at home â¤ï¸ "
,,,,,,,,"I couldn't have been happier with my experience at the Tiny house! I'm a huge fan of Tiny houses in general (addicted to watching the shows) so it was fun to finally be able to experience one.
The location was great - lots of places within a few minutes walk. And to walk to downtown/6th street was completely doable too. I was there by myself and I felt completely safe and comfortable walking about Austin.
I hope to get back to Austin again in the future - and I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! Way better than a hotel!
"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was such a sweet gracious host. I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a cute, great location to stay in Austin. She was so thoughtful l, it was the most pleasant comfort to come into after traveling all day. "
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was an amazing host.  She was very attentive and communication with her was very flawless.  She offered suggestions of places to eat, listen to music and place to enjoy some night life.  The tiny house was exactly as described and photoed.  I can't wait to stay there again! She made our trip even more flawless.  "
,,,,,,,,"A wonderful place to stay, especially if you are traveling alone! Cindy was very helpful and welcoming, and the location is great for seeing the rest of Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Cindy has really thought of every detail to make your stay as comfortable and special as possible. From local treats to maps and lists of nearby businesses and activities, she has not only made sure you have everything you need, but also anything you could possibly want and then some! Will stay here every time I come to town...and not just because I can walk down the street and start my day with a kouign amann at Josephine House. "
,,,,,,,,"Without question one of my best experiences with an AirBnb reservation. Cindy went above and beyond to make me feel at home and comfortable.  From a helpful neighborhood tour on arrival to recommendations for transportation back to the airport, Cindy was there.

The place is truly a tiny house, but had everything I needed for a pleasant stay.  Clarksville struck me as a charming neighborhood filled with friendly people and unique local businesses.  

Highly recommended and will return the next time I'm in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy is an amazing hostess!! this was my first Airbnb experience and we will definitely be using it again after this experience.  Cindy made us feel extremely welcome from the moment we booked our stay.  When we arrived the room was clean and then Cindy took us on a quick walking tour of the neighborhood-- which was awesome!! 

Can't say enough about our awesome trip!
Thanks Cindy!!"
,,,,,,,,"Amazing hospitality and comfort in the Cozy Tiny House. My mom and I stayed together for a night here. Charming neighborhood, close to 6th with quirky boutique shops. The tiny house is well stocked for any adventure you can think of and if it doesn't have it, Cindy is very responsive and helpful getting anything you might request, and expert local knowledge - she even drove me to my hotel I am staying at for work. Great A/C, wifi is good and cute stay for a quick mother daughter weekend getaway.

"
,,,,,,,,We had an amazing experience staying with Cindy! It was our first time in Austin and Cindy's neighborhood was really cute-awesome food and coffee! Cindy was super welcoming and available whenever we had questions. She even had chairs and towels so we could take a trip down to Barton Springs Pool. The tiny cozy house was great too! Even though it was tiny it had everything we needed and was close to everything you could want to do in Austin. Definitely book this place! 
,,,,,,,,Cindy was such an amazing host! We loved staying in her tiny house. It was just perfect for what we were looking for. It's unique and Cindy recommended so many wonderful restaurants and places to us to check out (that we tried and loved). She even gave us a quick tour around the area to show us where we could get food/shop. We would definitely love to come back and stay again. And it was only like a 6-7 minute drive from downtown. Definitely recommend for anyone who is looking for a great host/place to stay at in Austin =)
,,,,,,,,"The house was cozy, and comfortable. AC worked great. Cindy provided some snacks and drinks which was nice. She even showed me around town a bit."
,,,,,,,,Cindy is an awesome host - from the time we booked until after we left. She was easily the best host I've ever had for an Airbnb.
,,,,,,,,"What a delightful stay. The cozy little spot was as beautiful as the city, itself. I spent a fair bit of time in the room, chilling out on my vacation, but it was extremely easy to walk out and find fantastic dining and great culture just a few steps away. And Cindy â€” don't get me started on how welcome Cindy made me feel. She had guides and snacks awaiting me, and she walked me through all the ins and outs of the location, from the room itself to the neighborhood. This isn't a complaint, but you should know that the room is, indeed, small. That was fine for me, but it wouldn't be great for a family."
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was unbelievable. She cares so much about ever guest having an incredible time in Austin, not just at her ""tiny house."" From great recos to actually having dinner with my brother while he waited for my flight to land, her hospitality knows no bounds."
,,,,,,,,"Adorable little home, very cozy and comfortable. Clarksville is an awesome little area.  There are resturaunts and grocery stores with in walking distance. Cindy was a very helpful host. "
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at the Cozy Tiny house. It was perfect for a fun weekend in Austin. Cindy was a great host and we had everything we needed and more. The neighborhood is really nice and the house is in walking distance to a lot of attractions. We will definitely be back. 
,,,,,,,,Both the host and house were great. Cindy made me feel extremely welcome and provided everything I needed to navigate the neighborhood and Austin especially the tips about great places to go within walking distance. The listing description was accurate. It's cozy and tiny but it has all the space you'll need. It came with everything I needed and even some things I didn't realize I needed. You will be well-prepared for any adventure you will take in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Cindy was an attentive and gracious host that made me feel comfortable and welcomed. She showed me around the neighborhood and made me feel right at home. The tiny house was exactly what I was looking for during my solo trip to Austin. I would highly recommend Cindy spot to solo or couple travelers.
,,,,,,,,"Great place to explore the city from! The place isn't huge, but it has everything you need and is in great condition. Plus, the shower is amazing and Cindy gives tons of great recommendations in the neighborhood!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was a great host. Though her place was small, it had all the essentials. It is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood, about 5-10mins from downtown. We had some last minute changes to our original plans, but Cindy was very understanding and was able to accommodate our changes. She received us in person, gave us a nice tour of the neighborhood, and was constantly in touch with us throughout the stay to help us whenever needed. She is familiar with Austin, and was able to suggest many hidden jewels within the neighborhood. She is a very amiable person, and I'm so glad we could stay with her. Overall, we had a blast and would definitely return back to Cindy's when we visit Austin the next time."
,,,,,,,,"Just like everyone is saying, it's a great neighborhood and Cindy is a great host! 

She started off by walking us to a few places close by (as everything you could need is almost literally right around the corner) and this was a great help to get us acclimated.

There's some really nice eateries at just a stone's throw.

She's a kind and warm-hearted person and it shows in how she accommodates her guests.

As far as the little abode goes, it was everything as advertised and more--cozy, but with everything you need.

Historic Clarksville and its homely charm is sure to please just like Cindy and her Cozy Tiny Home!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was a great host, very friendly and accommodating. She gave us a short walking tour of the neighborhood, which was really nice. She was easily reachable and was able to help us with any questions that we had. The property was great and as advertised, and the neighborhood was safe and fun."
,,,,,,,,Cindy's tiny home was amazing!!!! We loved every minute of our stay in the perfect location in the downtown Austin area. Close enough to walk to town but enough away from it to have peace for a night if needed. There is also walkable restaurants and convenience stores right by. Cindy herself took us on a small tour of everything and made us feel completely at home. There is only one place to stay in Austin if you are visiting and that is with Cindy!
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved our stay in Cindy's tiny house! Cindy was an amazing host and very easy to communicate with. She made us feel at home by stocking the house with snacks, showing us around the house and even giving us a tour of the neighborhood. The tiny house is very clean, great bathroom and lots of storage for luggage, extremely comfortable mattress and a great patio. Can't wait to come back to Austin and the tiny house!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was just the absolute best! Such a warm arrival & gave a walking tour around the town. All the pictures were exactly as it is. Wow, what a place! Best AirBnB i've experienced :)"
,,,,,,,,"Great host, easy communication and comfy spot"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed three nights on a visit to see family. What a great experience - Cindy was so sweet and easy to get along with. She made us comfortable before we even arrived with pre-trip communication, clarity, etc. When we pulled up she was right there with a smile and joy that was contagious! The house is a great space for one or two - the enclosed patio in front is just perfect to relax and offers a little place to escape should your spouse/SO sleep in in the morning. The bathroom is palatial by tiny house standards and the full entertainment system options were a real treat. Bed was very comfortable and all the amenities and treats there to great us were unexpected and appreciated.  Clarksville is a gorgeous, historic, eclectic neighborhood just begging to be walked in and grabbing a coffee 30 seconds away was the perfect starting point. Add the Galaxy Cafe and Nau's within a block and this place is truly special. We will definitely recommend Cindy's place and will be back ourselves."
,,,,,,,,"Cindy obviously took a lot of care and love in creating the Cozy Tiny Home. I felt extremely comfortable and relaxed, thanks to the comfy bed and beautiful patio. Shower was great and the bathroom was well-appointed. She had snacks, drinks, and coffee/tea available and was in great communication with me before, during, and after my trip. The neighborhood is great with good food and booze choices nearby. I would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Our experience was really great! Our host was very receptive, and really great at communicating with us before and during our stay.  She made our traveling very easy, much like we were staying with family.  The home was tiny, but it had everything that we needed to have a comfortable stay.  It was quiet, and the neighborhood was really safe seeming with plenty of walkable locations for food and convenience, and close to the downtown (10 minute drive).  We had a private parking spot and really have no complaints to make about the weekend. We would go stay here again in a heartbeat the next time we head to Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"Cindy runs the best party in-town! First, the tiny houses' pictures and description tell a perfect story for the place you are renting. The location is very nice in Clarksville with restaurants and bars close plus a short car ride to downtown or other parts of Austin. 

Cindy is so welcoming and made our experience even better with her personal touches. She was very easy and timely to communicate with if we had any questions. We went on a walk of the area with her plus she shared a list of things to-do. 

I would highly recommend Cindy and the Tiny House! "
,,,,,,,,Cindy was a phenomenal host! Hands down the best I've ever had. Her home is super cute and she even stocks it with yummy snacks. The icing on the cake was when she found out I was arriving late and got me a pizza to eat when I arrived. 
,,,,,,,,Cindy is a great host.  The tiny house was very clean and comfortable.  The businesses that are all just steps away are all great too.  Cindy walked me down the street to point out all of the highlights.  She continued to make sure everything went well during our stay.  She even put cardboard over our car windows to protect it during a heavy thunderstorm while my wife and I were out on the town.
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was an amazing host. I booked the tiny house for five nights to attend SXSW. Cindy met me upon my arrival, gave me a wonderful tour of the cool places in the neighborhood, provided advice about where to go downtown and was all around amazing. 
The house is very cool, comfortable, clean, and funky. I walked about 95% of the time and was about a 30 minute walk to the convention center. I also did use uber, and car 2go a few times.
The neighborhood has several good restaurants and a great local cafe.
Cindy also stocked the house with some great snack and drinks.
cindy was always available and incredibly helpful throughout my stay and helped me recover my backpack which I left and had to run back to the house (luckily still made my flight)"
,,,,,,,,"This place is amazing. The surrounding neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, & safe. The coffee shop down the street (Medici) is awesome if you are a coffee fan like myself. The house is in a great location to walk to downtown Austin & see cool shops, bars, & restaurants along the way. It is tiny, but it's been constructed in a manner that doesn't feel tiny (hopefully that makes sense). Between the full stocked bathroom that got me hooked on Dr. Bronner's soap, the amazing bed, & how quiet the surrounding area is, you can't go wrong by staying here. I highly, highly recommended this place. 

Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Cindy until the last day of my stay, but she (and Ashley) still made me feel welcomed & was available to answer any questions. You can really tell that she loves to host & be social. Cindy has thought of everything imaginable that you could ever need while staying here, & then some. I think it's a perfect place for anyone looking to get away from the stress of life for a few days. 

Seriously, stay here. You'll love it. Thanks again Cindy! 
"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at Cozy Tiny House. It is very small, but extremely well put-together had absolutely everything we needed and more for our stay in Austin. The bed is extremely comfortable and Cindy has made sure that everything else you might need is available (towels, beach towels, glassware, toiletries, beach chairs, and a few drinks/snacks). the house is in a fabulous neighborhood - quiet, historic, just about anything you might need within walking distance, and a long walk or short drive from downtown Austin. Cindy was extremely friendly and took us on a great little neighborhood tour when we arrived. We would absolutely stay here again if we come back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy's place was great and worked out perfectly for our needs!  The space truly is cozy and tiny, but it's also makes for a fun and unique experience. 
Cindy met me upon arrival, gave me a quick tour of the studio and even walked me outside to point out restaurants and shops nearby.  She also left us really cute, thoughtful amenities (snacks, beverages, soaps, a local newspaper etc). She thought of everything a guest could want or need! The studio was very clean.
The location was nice and quiet and the Clarksville neighborhood is charming.  There's quite a bit to explore within walking distance, and plenty to explore with a car or bike.  "
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was amazing - her little home was perfect and we felt so welcomed when we got there. The location is great, Clarksville is SO cute and you have a bunch of things right around you. Easy walk from downtown and other great spots. We couldn't have had a better time! "
,,,,,,,,"Everything about Cindy and her tiny little home is cozy. You can tell she was born for hospitality--from the minute I met her I felt totally at home. She not only gave me a tour of the tiny house, but also the neighborhood which is a real gem in Austin. It's close to some great restaurants and is only about a hundred feet to a phenomenal little coffeeshop. Truly a great experience and so glad to have met this sweet lady."
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was such a sweet, welcoming person. My boyfriend and I traveled from San Antonio for a quick getaway and Cindy's place was perfect. The neighborhood has several great restaurants and coffee places. Getting to town is easy by bus or Uber. If you like to walk, you can get to the central part of 6th steet in about 30 minutes or so- that's about 1.5 miles. The Austin bus system rocks and is easy to use, so think about that option. Cindy was also kind enough to have shampoo, soap and goodies which was awesome because we forgot to bring everything. I would definately recommend her place to anyone. She is the hostess with the mostest."
,,,,,,,,"Cindy hosted us for a special occasion and made us feel so welcome from the second we pulled up. 

The actual house is perfect for a couple making the trip to Austin and we had no complaints whatsoever. 

Would definitely recommend. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was a fantastic host, upon arrival she took my partner and I on a tour of neighborhood shops and gave us great recommendations on what to do in Austin around the Holidays.  The tiny house was fabulous, Cindy even welcomed us with refreshments in our tiny fridge. If I am ever back in the Austin area I will certainly be back at this tiny house!"
,,,,,,,,"THE BEST!

Cindy was incredibly communicative and friendly from the minute I requested a reservation. She made sure I knew everything I needed to know well in advance. And when I arrived we went to a brilliant coffee shop down the street where she filled me in on all the things to do and see in the neighborhood. It was incredible.

The space itself is perfect and even more than I imagined it would be. The bed is probably the coziest one you will find in the western hemisphere. The layout is great, too. Plenty of room for such a small space. All the amenities. Spotlessly clean. The softest towels. So many lighting options. Quiet surroundings. I can't say enough good things.

Side note: the sidewalk in front of the driveway had been recently paved and written in the still-drying cement was the phrase ""YOU ARE SO LOVED!"" That's exactly how Cindy will make you feel and what the experience of staying in this ""Cozy Tiny House"" is like.

10/10 would stay here again. Thank you, Cindy!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy's place was wonderful. It was the perfect, welcoming little space to spend the night, with a super comfortable Murphy bed and in the coolest little neighborhood. Cindy also was super helpful pointing out everything in the neighborhood and lent me a couple jackets when she realized I didn't bring any for the cold weather."
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was an amazing host! The property was adorable, clean, had everything we needed and it was in the PERFECT location. 

We really enjoyed the stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Cindy was the perfect host and the little cabin was quiet and picturesque. The neighbourhood is very nice, with some good cafes and restaurants within a couple of hundred yards. About 30 minutes walk to the centre of town, through nice roads. All in all a lovely little place."
,,,,,,,,Cindy is very warm and welcoming. The neighborhood is the best in Austin- easy to get to everything. Her tiny house has everything you need and feels like home. Very tidy. Soft sheets on a comfy bed. Great TV and ice cold AC. The bathroom is huge and the shower has great pressure and never runs out of hot water. There are so many thoughtful details. The stained glass windows are beautiful! She also left us treats and a nice note upon our arrival. We love Cindy and highly recommend her house. We will definitely return!!
,,,,,,,,Wonderful experience. Great host. Great accommodations ! 
22982,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"It was a very restful stay!  Gina and her husband greeted me on arrival and made sure I was comfortable and situated.  The cottage is cozy and it felt like I was away from the city even though the center of the city is only a mile away!
The entire apartment is private (it is the entire second floor of the house w/a separate entrance).  There were snacks and drinks available in the fridge; that was a great touch!  It was raining and there was an umbrella at my fingertips and a few great restaurants just a 7-10 minute walk away.  The neighborhood is quiet but very accessible to anywhere in the city.  The apartment was very clean and very cute.  Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Stayed there twice now and it is just so perfectly located and on a quiet street. There are coffee shops, cafes and stores within walking distance too "
,,,,,,,,What a wonderful and cozy place to stay. Great location - easy ride to downtown or out to Lake Travis. Fridge was full of drinks and snacks. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay. Nice, quiet, and conveniently located. "
,,,,,,,,"Gina & Kens loft is in a great part of Austin within a stones throw of some of the city's best food. 
Their hospitality and responsiveness could not be faulted. 
The place itself is very private, spacious and comfortable. The pictures don't quite do the space justice as I'm sure you'll see should Gina & Ken allow you the privilege. "
,,,,,,,,Great location. Place was very clean and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. 
,,,,,,,,"Gina and Ken were great hosts. They were very knowledgeable of the area and recommended awesome spots to check out. The actual rental was in great shape, one of the best AirBNB's I have ever stayed in. I highly recommend if you want to stay in Austin close to everything and not break the bank!"
,,,,,,,,"Gina was superb. She and her husband were out of town when we made the very last minute reservation but she accommodated us perfectly and made sure we had people to contact should we need anything. The apartment itself was great.  It was very clean, well-stocked, and had a real home from home feel to it. It has character, is well situated for the central areas of Austin, and has a great cat!  We would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Gina!"
,,,,,,,,Gina's place was perfect for our stay.  Very clean and well provisioned.  Very close to everything Austin has to offer.  Thanks!  Would definately stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Gina and Ken are great hosts. Place is cozy and comfortable. Neighborhood is calm and at the same time in a walking distance from downtown. Proximity of Whole Foods Market is extremely convenient.   

We have really enjoyed our stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Hosts Gina and Ken were very welcoming.  Snacks/coffee/juices were available in room.  Neighborhood is wonderful, walking distance to restaurants/coffee shop.  The accommodations were great--2 bedrooms worked out great for us.  Will book again!"
,,,,,,,,Very nice place in a beautiful and quiet neighbourhood. Just a 20 minute walk to downtown en also a few lovely restaurants around the corner. And Gina and Ken are lovely hosts!
,,,,,,,,"Gina's place was perfect for our stay, she provided wine,drinks and snacks upon our arrival and the check in process was very easy.  We loved our time in Austin and would highly recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"We just had a fantastic trip to Austin, Gina treated us like family and the apartment was perfect for the three of us. We were close enough to all the action that we ended up walking  almost everywhere. We'd highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Gina's apartment was wonderful! Great location and easily comfortable for 3-4 people. Uber rides to 6th street, Rainey, and downtown were $6-8. I didn't meet Gina herself, but her husband Ken was super friendly and laid back. Gina accommodated our changes in travel plans and was easy to communicate with. Overall, I would definitely recommend this listing for someone staying for a weekend, or even longer :)"
,,,,,,,,"What a great little place.  Two spacious double rooms and I guess a sofabed but we never tried it.  Kitchen was well equipped for s few days stay and we were very comfortable.  Not too far from Downtown and easy/cheap rides on Uber are always only minutes away.

We only met Gina and her husband once but they seem like pleasant people, the stay was totally private and quiet round the back of their property.  Recommended."
,,,,,,,,I had a wonderful time at the Empty Nest for my first ten days as an Austin resident. Gina and Ken are exceptional hosts and very welcoming. 
,,,,,,,,"Gin's apartment is exactly as described in the listing. It is clean, comfortable with two bedrooms that was more than enough space for us and a parking space. Gina was very flexible in our check in and check out times and it was very nice of her to keep the kitchen stalked with beverages and snacks. The neighborhood is in a great residential area that is quiet, safe and very close to downtown. So it was perfect for me and my girlfriend. Overall I'm very satisfied with our stay at Gina's empty nest. "
,,,,,,,,Great space - so close to downtown yet a charming area with great old homes and buildings around the streets nearby.  Coffee is walking distance.  Love the wood staircase leading to the charming little porch and entry.  It creates a very private feeling and although there are homes and apartments next door I saw very few people and only heard others a couple times. This was my first airbnb and I loved it.  Thanks Gina and Ken I'll be back.  This was a business trip and normally I book at a hotel but wanted to try the empty nest - what a great value compared to the cost of a hotel.  I also used Uber for the first time - the empty nest had Uber drivers less than 5 minutes away everytime.  Super convenient.
,,,,,,,,"Gina is wonderful, the place is exactly as advertised and has everything you need, and is in a very convenient location.  Nothing but great things to say.  Thanks Gina!  "
,,,,,,,,"Gina's place was absolutely wonderful! It was very clean, larger than it looked from the pictures, and full of yummy snacks and drinks to welcome us. The place is also very private and quiet, and has a lovely porch looking out onto a yard. Gina was an attentive host, and was always responsive to questions. I am looking forward to staying again!"
,,,,,,,,"This is such a fantastic space! It is huge, really cozy, all the amenities you could need. Gina made it super easy for check in and check out. The space is very close and walkable to downtown. The one thing I would point out is that there is a VERY steep hill (think, there are stairs for part of it, that's how steep) to walk to the block Gina's house is on. Pro tip: walking west on 6th street and then north, rather than west on 12th street, is a much less steep climb. The space itself was perfect, comfy, everything you could need. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Gina's empty best with my boyfriend and two friends for SXSW and had a great time. Both Gina and her husband Ken were really accommodating and quick to respond if we ever needed them for anything. They had lots of great suggestions for places to go in the area and made us feel at home straight away. The empty nest itself is a great place and looks exactly as it does in the photos, there's lots of space and a lovely veranda at the front which is great to sit out in the evenings and take in your surroundings. It's within walking distance to Wholefoods and downtown as well as some great restaurants in the opposite direction too. I'd recommend the empty nest to anyone looking to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Gina was extremely welcoming and helpful. Very responsive to emails and we couldn't ask for anything more.

The apartment itself is bigger than the pictures make it out to be. I didn't even realize there were 2 bedrooms! Originally there were only supposed to be three of us, which would have been perfect, however we ended up having a 4th person stay... it was a 'little' tight but totally manageable and we all had a great time.

Highly recommend both the apartment and the host!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience using Airbnb, and it was fabulous! We arrived at the Empty Nest and were greeted with a nice welcome note with recommendations of nearby restaurants and stores, drinks, and snacks. It was a cute, cozy 2-bed place that looked just like the photos; we loved how it felt like we were staying at a friend's house and just chilling! It was perfect for the four of us.

One thing that struck me was the attention to detail in the apartment. There were to-go menus of nearby restaurants hanging on the wall, books and magazines about Austin, Austin drink coasters...even the drinks in the little fridge reflected a certain Texas feel. There were movies available to watch, a chess/checkers board, plenty of extra blankets and towels, and some amenities in case you forgot shampoo, soap, and the like.

The apartment was tucked away on the second floor behind the main house; the surrounding trees and small, open air front porch area was refreshing in the mornings and evenings. Their cat Pawlee visited us a few times during our stay and got lots of love from my cat-loving husband. :) We ended up walking through the neighborhood to the grocery store 3 blocks away, and we felt safe, secure, and enjoyed the quiet scenery.

Since we spent a good part of the weekend near downtown and 6th Street, it was so convenient to drive literally 5 minutes to anywhere we needed to go. We visited some stores nearby - Whole Foods flagship store (so huge and awesome!), Anthropologie, REI, BookPeople.

We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We were in Austin for a long weekend, and our entire stay at Gina's apartment was fantastic.  Check in was a breeze, and she had left snacks and drinks in the fridge for our arrival.  The apartment is very clean and spacious with two full bedrooms, a full bath with plenty of fluffy towels, and the beds were extremely comfortable.  We had rented a car and mostly drove to downtown as we didn't luck out with great weather, but the apartment is easily within walking distance to many bars and restaurants.  It's a safe, quiet neighborhood - the perfect sanctuary, and SO much better than a hotel!  Can't say enough great things, it's the perfect place to stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,My wife and I truly enjoyed our visit to Austin. We spent 4 nights at The Empty Nest and really enjoyed our stay. It was very clean and had very comfortable beds. It's in a nice quiet neighborhood within walking distance to shops and restaurants. I highly recommend the Empty Nest as a great place to stay. We plan on making it our first choice to stay on our many return trips to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Thank you Gina! You guys were such gracious hostâ€¦ 
They were quick to try to accommodate our requests. Their places are absolutely charming and cozy place, larger than expected. A spacious 2 bedroom in a lovely neighborhood. Definitely will try to stay again! Wonderful experience!"
,,,,,,,,"I've stayed in the Empty Nest before, and liked it then, as I liked it this time round. The apartment is clean and pleasant and the beds are extremely comfortable. It's located in an extremely attractive part of town. It's a bit of a walk from the town centre, but a good walk, which takes you past many enticing bars and restaurants. Overall, judging the place for location, quality and warmth of welcome, I'd say it's pretty close to perfect. Thanks, Gina. "
,,,,,,,,"A friend and I recently stayed at the empty nest for ACL and a UT game. Great location (within 2 miles of basically anywhere), and everything about the accommodations was accurate. Gina was a great host, and very helpful with any questions we had. "
,,,,,,,,"This was our first visit to Austin and we didnÂ´t want to live in a hotell, but in a ""normal"" neighborhood - so near normal life as possible. So we found a nice and clean flat in a great area and great town. Very nice hosts - thank you for letting us stay with you. We really can recommend the ""Empty nest"". Christine Johnson"
,,,,,,,,"Staying here was a great experience. Gina and Ted were very accommodating. We stayed for 7 days and they checked in to see if we needed anything, but it wasn't necessary because they think of so much before you even arrive. Awesome place to stay."
,,,,,,,,"Ken and Gina are great hosts. They are plugged into the music and restaurant scene in Austin and happy to share advice on where the most fun is to be has. They are unbelievably generous, Ken even gave us a ride to the airport when cabs were hard to come by during SCSW.

The accommodations are great - clean, and plenty of space for three of us on a guys weekend. "
,,,,,,,,"Lovely accommodation in a great location. Clean and plenty of towels - thank you. We stayed two nights in Austin on the weekend of the F1 GP. We are now tending to choose apartment style accommodation when we travel over a hotel room. Off street parking here too which was great. Would recommend this apartment.   
Nicola and Gary (Scots living in Oklahoma City)"
,,,,,,,,The place was perfect for us! Great location- right near 6th St and Lamar. The place was very thoughtfully stocked with lots of things you might need. Gina was very accommodating. We really enjoyed our stay.
,,,,,,,,"Gina's place was lovely. Great location, Gina was easy to coordinate with, it had off street parking. I'd definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,Extremely pleasant and comfortable. Comfy beds and clean. Great stay. 
,,,,,,,,Gina place was very clean and within good walking distance to local hotspots.  Gina was very helpful with tips and navigation around Austin.  We'd love to come back!
,,,,,,,,"Gina was a great host. The apartment was exactly what we were expecting, very clean and all linen was provided. It is set in an incredibly nice part of Austin. The location is ideal, for anyone looking to explore the city itself as it is close enough that you are never more than a 10 minute cab ride from most things. Overall huegly enjoyed our stay. So thanks very much. "
,,,,,,,,"Good, clean, as advertised.  "
,,,,,,,,"Loved my stay at ""The Empty Nest"" during SXSWi this year. Gina and Ken were warm and welcoming and everything about the place is great. The location (easy 20-30 min walk to downtown or a quick cab or Car2Go) was convenient, the price was very reasonable, the rooms were spacious, and really couldn't ask for more. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Very nice and spacious loft in excellent and calm position. Gina and Ken a generous hosts helping us with all our needs. We were 4 persons, one was sleeping in the living room very comfortably. The beds in the bedrooms are narrow for two persons - only suitable for couples ;-) The kitchen is very small but equipped - you cannot really cook here."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, clean and good location. Would definitely stay here again"
,,,,,,,,"This apt. is private and in a wonderful neighborhood. The owners were very friendly and accomodating. I'd stay there again.

"
,,,,,,,,"My colleague and I were visiting for a workshop at UT Austin - Gina's place was perfect!  The neighborhood was very charming and quiet, and there was a shuttle to campus right around the corner.  We also walked 3 blocks to the local grocery store and ate at Zocalo Cafe, a terrific little fresh-mex place similarly close.  The apartment itself was clean and well stocked with a microwave, mini-fridge, silverware, cups, tv with cable and more.  Definitely recommend for a stay in Austin!  Especially if you need a place with 2 full, private bedrooms."
,,,,,,,,"The Empty Nest was a great experience from start to finish. It is in a lovely neighborhood just far enough from a major street to be quiet yet close enough to be convenient to downtown Austin. Gina and Ken provided many thoughtful extras - maps, snacks, fans, Post Office runs - and were available most of our stay though not ""hovering"". They are a wonderful resource in Austin and we would gladly stay again. I would recommend The Empty Nest to anyone staying in Austin for more than a night who wants a home away from home rather than a swish hotel."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was amazing.  It was reasonably close to 6th Street (about an $8 cab ride), and Gina and her husband were very accommodating and gave us some great tips for places to visit in Austin.  I highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"Gina's place was very nice. My son stayed there for 10 weeks and it was perfect. Great location. Nicely furnished and pleasant neighborhood. 

Thanks for everything."
,,,,,,,,"Everything went smooth and our host was very friendly.
Its about 12 to 15 minutes walk to Whole Foods Market
and a little bit moremto Downtown.
The Neighbourhood is very quiet."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin staying at Gina's place. This is a really good choice for a group of four. Good location near enough to all the fun downtown action like the lake, 6th street and an adorable coffee shop, cafe Medici, where they will make your cappuccino perfectly.  We really felt welcome through out the stay. The fridge is a little small, so if you are planning on cooking, this may not be the spot for you. Thanks Gina!"
,,,,,,,,Gina's converted attic was lovely and perfect for our stay in Austin at the convention center.  Thanks for letting us stay there!
,,,,,,,,"Gina was a great host and was very helpful! The rooms were very cute, tidy and comfortable. I had easy access to cable, wifi, and pretty much everything I could need. The location was a short cab ride downtown and in a nice area with tons of places to go nearby. I would happily stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Gina's upstairs apartment was clean, cozy, and a great alternative to some stale hotel room, and the whole process of reserving and arranging our arrival was very easy."
,,,,,,,,"For SXSWi 2012, I stayed with a group of 4 at the Empty Nest. From first contact to checkout, Gina was just wonderful. As we corresponded in the lead-up to the conference, she patiently dealt with my dispatches regarding an ever-shifting group of guests. Once we got into town (all on different flights), she handled not one, not two, but three separate waves of guest arrivals! One day during our stay when it was raining, she even offered to drive two of us downtown so that we wouldn't have to walk or try to call a cab. And to update a previous review, this place definitely now has Wi-Fi. We loved our stay and would recommend Gina's place to anyone looking for a cozy place close to downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great experience, would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay, at a good price. We never heard noise, nor were disturbed during our stay. Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"The Empty Nest was great!  It was spacious and very clean.  The location is fantastic.  It is close to UT campus, downtown, Whole Foods, Zilker, etc.  Gina and her husband were very welcoming.  It was nice to stay in a home instead of a hotel, especially with our baby."
,,,,,,,,The Empty Nest was great! Gina was very welcoming and gave us good recommendations for places to eat and things to do while we were in Austin. A wonderful location--we would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"The Empty Nest was just as described and Gina provided great answers to us at all stages of the process. She was quick to answer questions via the AirBNB site before we booked, gave us help via e-mail as we planned our arrival, and had good recommendations on some delicious nearby restaurants when we arrived and were hungry.

For us, this location was about a 20 minute walk from the AT&T Conference Center and/or UT campus so it is a decent location for an event at one of those locations.

The wifi and radio system worked great. The bookshelves have interesting locally focused books/movies/DVDs. Some historic greats (Johnny Cash at Austin City Limits) were complemented with updated local magazines and newspapers with info on fun things to see and do in Austin.

"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place located right in the heart of Clarksville - 5-10 minutes from downtown, 5-10 minutes from UT/football stadium, easy mopac and 35 access. It was  definitely very clean and stylish. Included free wifi, Uverse tv, ipod dock/radio. Owners, Gina and Ken were as acommodating and cool as they could possibly be and were very easy to get in contact with prior to my stay. I've stayed at just about all hotels downtown over the past few years for various occasions(omni, sfa, radisson, driskill etc.) and I really think this (particular place and overall concept)is a far better deal and highly recommend it.   "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place, about 2 miles from downtown Austin.  Gina is friendly and was very responsive to calls/emails.  The place was spacious, had 2 bedrooms, and was very clean.  They don't have wifi access, so that is only downside.  If they install wifi, I would likely stay there again."
11220716,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Alisha & Alex are great hosts. The house is simple and offers just what you need for a comfortable stay in Austin. Thanks! 
,,,,,,,,"Alisha and Alex were great hosts, and their apartment was the perfect place to stay during SXSW. The neighborhood is quiet, but it's easily walkable to 6th Street and other great locations. And when I wanted to stay close to home base, Alisha and Alex gave great recommendations for food, drink, and other attractions in the area."
,,,,,,,,"A very nice location near downtown Austin. Alisha was very welcoming and the room and bathroom where nice, clean and perfect for a few days stay in the city. This was a lastminute stayover and I am happy Alisha made it happen on such a short notice!
Theres a nice breakfast place just around the corner and the neighbourhood seems like an interesting one to explore further. Recommended."
,,,,,,,,"This house is becoming my go-to when I stay in Austin. The place is a very quick walk to 6th St and Rainey St. The room is really tranquil with a view of the backyard, and a comfy mattress. I'll be back! "
10430885,4.5,10,9,9,10,10,9,"Great experience! Very nice and quiet neighborhood, within walking distance to a lot of restaurants. Very clean and spacious house, we loved the kitchen, the host provided everything you could possibly need to cook. The only downside is that the house randomly makes strange noise (e.g. the toilet makes strange noises when you flush it). Overall, it's a fantastic experience and we would definitely recommend to our friends."
,,,,,,,,bobs place was in the perfect location. We had a group of girls and we never once felt scared or unsafe. The house is nice and open with a perfect set up. 2 bedrooms downstairs and 2 bedroom upstairs . Would highly recommend this property to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,"The house was in a great location on South Lamar close to a lot of food and entertainment options.  It's spacious, bright, and well stocked."
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay here was great.  The house was modern, well kept and in a really great neighbourhood that was  quiet,  but near food and shopping."
,,,,,,,,The house was wonderful! The host was responsive within a few hours. The only bummer is there is not a grill available for use. Otherwise we had a very nice stay! The bedrooms were very comfy.
14102989,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Kelsey's place is so spacious and tastefully decorated and in the most perfect location. We loved staying there and would recommend it to anyone!!
,,,,,,,,"This is the perfect downtown location, close to everything, with great views from the windows. Our stay was a great experience and he was very accommodating. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was PERFECT. GREAT location, very clean, cute, and cozy. Major points for the extremely comfortable king size bed. The place also includes a parking spot in the garage next door which was so helpful. Kelsey was extremely accommodating and responsive if we had any questions. I don't have one complaint! I definitely recommend checking out the bakery/beer garden next door called Easy Tiger. Great coffee, bakery, and bar!"
,,,,,,,,This place was awesome!  Great location.  You can walk to both 6th St and Rainey St. 
,,,,,,,,Incredible location! Super convenient and easy to find. Apartment was perfect!
,,,,,,,,"Nice clean place with a modern feel and a great view. Access to Easy Tiger makes ending the night really convienent. Navigating the parking garage and elevators was a tad confusing, but the arrival instructions helped clarify. This spot was perfect for hosting my small family during the holidays. "
,,,,,,,,"If you are attending a conference and all you want to do is sleep and maybe take a shower in your airbnb, this place is fine. If you like to rent airbnb's because they have accommodations that allow you to do things you would do in your own home - like cook a meal, for example - this is not the place. There no pots and pans. And the building appears to be a bit worse for wear - the lobby and elevators smell like dog urine. The location was good, but we would have been better off getting a hotel - at least we would have had room service. "
,,,,,,,,"The condo was spacious with high ceilings and large windows. Note that the walls in the bedroom don't go all the way to the ceiling. The location was awesome. It only took 5 minutes to walk to the convention centre or 6th Street where there are lots of restaurants and pubs. Also, it was only about a kilometre away from running trails along the river."
,,,,,,,,Kelsey was very responsive and accommodating to my request to check in early (which I truly appreciated)!  Her detailed instructions with photos made check-in and check-out easy.
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood, right downtown walking distance to a lot of great stuff. The space was modern with new appliances and an amazing view of downtown Austin from the living room. The bed was clean and comfortable. There is an awesome cafe, bakery and beer garden right next door perfect for morning coffee or an evening night cap. Great place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Kelsey's downtown condo was perfect for our stay! We loved the lofted ceilings, incredible views, and the location was unbeatable. We will definitely recommend it to others visiting Austin! "
,,,,,,,,The apartment is very nice and the location can't be beat!
,,,,,,,,Beautiful place and great location. What more do I need to say? It's walking distance to 6th st. (Both east and west) as well as Rainey st. Only a short cab ride to SoCo. Thanks for a great stay!
,,,,,,,,Communication was great.  Check in was easy.  Can't beat the location.  Would stay here again for sure.  Thanks.
,,,,,,,,Kelsey had everything ready and organized for us. Sent an email with a detailed description and pictures of everything you can think of to get to the place and parking. In her apartment there was also a list of things to do while you are visiting Austin and places to eat at. That list helped me figure a few things to do.
,,,,,,,,Checking in was easy & the condo was as described.  The condo was also quiet considering how close it is to 6th street.
,,,,,,,,Great experience. Location was spot on and couldn't have been any better especially considering the price. Will be looking to book Kelsey's place again next time I'm in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,A super clean place and a great view of downtown made this a wonderful 2 night accommodation for me. I wish I could've stayed longer!
,,,,,,,,"Kelsey's place was great, clean, tidy, and exactly as described. 

Couldn't ask for a better host!"
,,,,,,,,Kelsey was an amazing host and super helpful! Two of my girlfriends and I went to Austin for a weekend and we have never been there before - Kelsey gave us a bunch of recommendations on places to go and try. She did a wonderful job at accommodating our check-in and check-out times based on our flights. The apartment was in walking distance to Downtown and Rainy Street. I highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Nice apartment, very well located!  We stayed here during the hottest week of the summer, and it was so great to have the great music and nightlife of Austin right beneath our feet and a comfy cool apartment to come home to! And the best beer garden in Austin is LITERALLY next door - who could ask for more? "
,,,,,,,,Kelsey had an absolutely awesome condo and the location couldn't be any better. Her communication and check in process was a breeze.
1776078,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Jaclyn responded right away when booking and provided us with detailed check in information. The apt was in the perfect location, walking distance everywhere. And it was so perfectly clean and well equipped. She even had a couple snacks / beverages waiting for us! Thanks for being a fantastic host. We really enjoyed our stay!"
,,,,,,,,Felt very welcome
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyns place was great! We have no complaints about our stay! Everything was perfect from the place, the location and all the things we were able to walk to. "
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I took a chance and tried Airbnb for the first time for our girls getaway to Austin.  The check-in process was easier than a hotel.  Jaclyn's place was stocked like a hotel and perfectly kept.  She even left us some treats in the fridge upon our arrival.  It felt like our own place for the weekend.  The location was GREAT for what we wanted to do.  Everything was less than a mile away that we wanted to see.  I would highly recommend for anyone staying with a small group.  Initially it stated it could sleep 6, but we like are space and 2 was just perfect!  "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Jaclyn's home could not have gone any better. The location is superb, and Jaclyn is one of the best hosts I've had while staying at an Airbnb. I'd encourage anyone looking to stay here to book without any hesitations!"
,,,,,,,,"The area was perfect, safe, and super close to a lot of bars and restaurants. I would 100% stay here again. There's an awesome smoothie/acai bowl place right across from the airbnb. I highly recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn's condo was just what we expected! We loved the location and it was very clean. It was perfect for 2 people, I probably wouldn't do an extended stay with more. Jaclyn very promptly replied the one time we needed help! Thanks for a safe and clean place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn is a super hostess.  Her place is full of unexpected amenities that I have not found in other stays (lots of towels, sundries, beer, chips, etc.)  She provides detail clear instructions. There are two sinks - one in bedroom and other in bathroom which is very convenient. There are multiple bed options - including an air mattress which was quite comfortable. It's a good location - 2 blocks from clubs and bars and lots of restaurants nearby.  Austin does not have the best public transit system so it is a 4-5 block walk to most of the North/South lines.  However, it is very close to an Airport Metro bus stop."
,,,,,,,,"You could not ask for a nicer, more centrally-located place to stay in the heart of Austin. Two blocks from the Convention Center, two blocks from 6th Street bars and music. Awesome location! 

Entrance into the courtyard/balcony of the overall unit was not readily obvious, but once inside you felt extremely safe - not that this section of Austin is dangerous, but once inside you felt quite secluded. 

The facilities themself are very nice. Beautiful decor, enough space for a couple or maybe even a family of four. Everything works well (once you figure out the the front door lock - lol). Beds are comfortable.  Shower had good pressure and enough hot water. The kitchen is very nice. Jaclyn left a bottle of wine, several beers and some soda, a couple bags of chips, a fresh jar of salsa, etc. Nice touch! 

Jaclyn was very accommodating when I booked. I wanted to bill the unit against a central corporate travel card (which I don't carry) and she informally held the unit a few days while we worked out the communications logistics (thanks again!)

I would gladly stay here again if I have reason to be in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn was so helpful on letting us know how to get to the apartment from the airport, and was very flexible about our check-in.  The apartment was perfect - everything was as described.  We would definitely recommend to friends in the future.  Thanks so much!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, especially when attending ACL festival. Close to shuttle bus to Zilker Park and close to 6th Street.

The host had welcoming drinks in the fridge and everything was smooth and easy wrt getting accomodated.

Great place!"
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn was great to work with, she made the experience super easy!  What a great location!  We were a block away from the start of the Detour Radiolab tour which was really cool.  Walking distance to a bunch of restaurants and breakfast tacos, not to mention 6th St which was a huge party every night.  We hung at the pool one day which was great!  She has a blow up bed so all 3 of us were nice a comfortable.  Jaclyn even left us some goodies in the fridge and on the counter!  Great experience, highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn was incredibly accommodating. She welcomed our group with snacks and drinks! Extra toiletries I case we forgot some, plenty of blankets, cleaning supplies, etc. everything was so convenient. Very quick rides to Raney Street, located in the heart of downtown. Grocery store directly behind the complex, liquor store up the street, and plenty of restaurants all within walking distance. The pool got a little rowdy on Saturday, but besides that everything was great!"
,,,,,,,,"Jacyln was communicative in advance and as we arrived and available for anything we needed, which wasn't really anything -- I mean it was all provided for as described. She even left a few snacks and drinks for us. 

The condo is in a fantastic location in the city, just two blocks from what seemed to be the most happening part of 6th street and just a few more blocks from the capital and the riverfront. We rented bikes two blocks away and biked all over the place.

The condo itself was comfortable for our group of 4 adults, with one person on a couch bed and one on a comfortable air mattress and the other two on beds."
,,,,,,,,"My visit in Austin was perfect and it all started off with a bang because of Jaclyn's amazing place!
The apartment is in a great spot, super cute, very clean, and she is very responsive and helpful. I highly recommend this spot!"
,,,,,,,,"Our first AirBNB experience and it was great! Jaclyn was super helpful and provided detailed instructions that let us find the apartment easily. Everything was in great condition, and the pool a great convience and included parking. Proximity to 6th Street can't be beaten and it made a great base camp for exploring greater Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn's condo was perfect for our stay! It was in a great location in the heart of downtown Austin. Jaclyn gave great directions/instructions for our arrival to the complex. The condo itself had everything we needed. It was very clean and was exactly as described. The fridge was stocked and there were snacks to get our weekend started! The beds were very comfortable, and we used the pull out sofa bed with the foam mattress topper in the cabinet. The condo was great for 6 girls to get ready in- there was an extra sink/mirror in the bedroom and the closet doors were full length mirrors. We had such a fun weekend! Jaclyn was awesome, I would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"Hostess with the Mostess! Great experience from start to finish, beautiful place and GREAT location!"
,,,,,,,,"We came for a gaming convention held at the Austin Convention center, so of course the location was perfect. But it was also insanely close to some great places to eat, as well as Yoga which I used a few times. It was very welcome when we arrived, there were chips and deep and some beer in the fridge which was great after a long flight. It was spacious, enough clean towels for 6! Pool was great, always clean and never crowded so just chilling out at the Airbnb and more than relaxing. Jaclyn was a great host, gave great and thorough instructions and the next time I'm in Austin this will be my first choice for accommodation "
,,,,,,,,"Wow, wow, wow! Had the most amazing time in Austin Texas. Jaclyn was beyond accommodating with myself and 4 girlfriends.  Her apartment is beautiful, well maintained and top of the line finishing's. The location of the apartment is in the heart of the fun but a few blocks away so you don't hear the loud crowds out till the wee hours. We were easily able to accommodate 5 and could have had another 2 people comfortably. Ps The Air mattress is VERY comfortable :) We were able to check in early as we came in on the red eye and Jaclyn advised us of some great spots for food (PS.check out the 24 diner for chicken and waffles and Wanderlust for an Acai Bowl). Every question was responded and attended to immediately with friendliness. She left beverages, beer, snacks and treats which we gobbled up! To sum her up- A southern bell! 
The pool is amazing and hosted many good times for us girls :) A true requirement when you head to Austin in the hot summer time. The condo unit seemed to be mostly Airbnb rentals which meant you will meet some fun people from around the world down by the pool.
Also- check out wanderlust yoga for a class. It is an amazing studio with truly beautiful people.
If you are looking for an amazing place to stay by a sweet host, you must come here!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect downtown spot.  The location is great, space laid out/organized nicely with everything you need, including washer/dryer.  Jaclyn was very responsive and a great host."
,,,,,,,,The condo was in great condition and great location.  Jaclyn's instructions for getting in were spot on and very helpful.  She was easy to reach and responded quickly when we had questions.  We will definitely refer her place to friends travelling to Austin.
,,,,,,,,This place was great!  Perfectly located and really comfortable. And off street parking which made it so easy to come and go. We loved the pool. The condo was clean and well set up for a great stay. Highly recommended. 
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying at the place. Jaclyn has our fridge stocked with snacks and drinks when we arrived. She provided us with detailed instructions, making our stay incredible easy. Great location! "
,,,,,,,,Great location for convention center or downtown Austin. Apartment was clean and neat. Jaclyn was responsive when I had an issue with the lock and keys. Would absolutely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Wow!  You cannot go wrong staying at this Airbnb.  I wish I could live in this flat.  It's beautiful and clean and central to everything.  The pool is small and was filled with lots of bachelorette parties but everyone is friendly and believe me, in Austin, a pool of any size is absolutely necessary. 
You won't find a better location and the instructions to get into the unit are straight forward.  If you need any help, the host is readily available.   Great kitchen. Clean bathroom with awesome water pressure. We could
Not have been more pleased with our accommodations.  Highly recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location if you are doing business near the convention center in downtown Austin.  Excellent selection of restaurants, bars, and coffee houses nearby.  The condo is very well decorated, maintained, and equipped.  It was a great welcome to have a stocked fridge with an excellent drink selection.  I would describe this property as exactly as described if not better.  Zero issues with locating and/or accessing the property.  If you stay here, know that you are just a couple of blocks from everywhere.  Try Gus's fried chicken or Moonshine Grill."
,,,,,,,,First time in Texas and first trip with AirB&B stayed 3 nights in Austin and had a blast - great apartment we were 3 make adults plenty of space. Great location for the lakes and close to the party street that is 6th street - the host was great gave clear instructions for directions and access - drinks and snacks left for us - much appreciated - just a great experience 
,,,,,,,,"The location of this apartment was more than ideal. Within walking distance of a lot of Austin's ""must see and do"" while visiting. There were also some drinks and snacks awaiting us upon our arrival which was really nice especially after a long day of traveling. The posting was very accurate for what we got. "
,,,,,,,,Nice little gaff the location was superb only thing stopping this from 5 star was the tragic wifi. If u want to be able to access the Internet either stay somewhere else or you wait 5 hours for the page to load. 
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn's apartment was great and she was super-easy to work with. Our late-night arrival was very smooth, because her directions and access instructions were very clear. The apartment was very secure, clean and had all the amenities we needed. Beds were comfortable, kitchen is well-stocked. The location is a short walk from the nightlife on 6th street, but not so close that the noise would be a problem. We didn't rent a car, just walked, biked and uber-ed around - the central location made everything easy. Wifi is slow/unreliable (it's a shared network for the entire apartment complex), but this is the  only minor annoyance in an overall great stay."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Jaclyn's place. The location is perfect - an easy walk to 6th, 4th and Rainey Street entertainment areas, Lady Bird Lake walking/biking trails, state capital complex, etc. The condo had everything we needed and was very clean. The available off-street parking was also very beneficial. Working with Jaclyn was a breeze - excellent at communicating and she sent us very helpful check-in and other instructions. We would definitely stay here again for a return trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Jaclyn was a perfect host! She responded to all of our questions within a timely manner so we were always in the know. The condo was absolutely adorable and very clean. it felt very  homey to stay there. We had an awesome time and would love to stay at Jaclyn's condo next trip to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Jaclyn was an excellent host and her place was exactly as it looked in the post. It was perfect for our little group. She helped with any questions we had throughout the entire stay and even let from cute snacks out for us when we got there! The location is perfect. You can walk or Uber anywhere downtown! If you are looking for a place downtown in the action this is the place to choose. I am already talking about bringing my husband down in the fall and hoping Jaclyn will have the place available.
,,,,,,,,Great Place!  Great Location!  Thanks Again!!
,,,,,,,,Lots of little food items and drinks left by the host! Decorated and outfitted very nice~
,,,,,,,,We loved our time in Austin and using this condo! Such a cute place and very accurately described by the pictures and descriptions! Loved that there were snacks for us when we got there since we arrived quite late at night. Easy to get in and out and very close to downtown. We only had to use an uber once or twice to get to the other side of town for an attraction we wanted to see. Very pleased with our stay! Would highly recommend 
,,,,,,,,The space was awesome! It was super convenient to everything we wanted to visit in Austin. The host gave great instructions and it was very easy to get into the condo. I would recommend this space to anyone and come back! 
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay in the townhouse. It was centrally located to everything downtown, clean, and had everything we needed. I definitely would book it again next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn was an amazing host! She was very thorough in her instructions and truly thought of every detail when it came to her condo. My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Jaclyn's place was cute, comfortable, safe, and within walking distance of all kinds of fun in Austin. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Jaclyn!"
,,,,,,,,Excellent condo in downtown Austin! Very clean- great communication with owner! Highly recommend!!
,,,,,,,,"Great place and awesome location, at the heart of Austin. Jaclyn has been very helpful and kind. I am glad to recommend Jaclyn's apartment."
,,,,,,,,"I have a feeling that I am now forever Airbnb spoiled and nothing will live up to this first experience. 

The place looks just like the photos, which is rare these days.

Jaclyn was very helpful and provided ample information about accessing the unit ahead of time.  The couple of questions I did have for her were answered promptly.

The snack were a super nice touch and I am now a fan of Topo Chico - thanks.

The condo is very close to a lot that Austin has to offer.  I was in town for a music festival down at Auditorium Shore and it was easily walkable.  6th Street and the Red River Music districts are also very walkable. 

Took a Uber to South Lamar and it was about $7.  I would guess if you need to go to the college it would be similarly priced.

Everything was provided, bathroom supplies, nice fluffy towels, fullly stocked kitched with pots, pans, plates, utensils, etc., washer/dryer, cleaning supplies, cozy beds, and different types of pillows.

I was there with a girlfriend and we felt very safe at the complex and in the unit.

The neighborhood can be a bit noisey but it is what it is.

Also, the unit is right off the Metro 100 line from the airport so if you don't have a car and don't want to spend a bunch on transportation, the bus was easy and cheep.

I love Austin and this condo made it one of my best trips!"
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn's place was great! My friends and I just spent a long weekend there and staying at Jaclyn's definitely contributed to how much we loved Austin. 

Unit: The apartment was clean, well-stocked, and really cozy. We appreciated her funky art, assorted board games, and free snacks. We rented a car, and Jaclyn left very detailed information about parking, getting in & out of the building, and making the most of the space. The double sinks were really clutch for 5 girls sharing one bathroom, too! It really felt like a home away from home.

Location: The apartment is about 2 block from the hoppin' ""fratty"" part of E 6th street (which is so convenient even if you don't intend to spend time there), and super close to many major attractions, eateries (including the newly-opened Voodoo Donuts!), and more. 

Communication: Jaclyn was very responsive and prompt with messages, including text communication during our stay. We were having trouble figuring out the shower handle, and she promptly sent us a very helpful video how-to.

I'd highly recommend Jaclyn's spot if you're ever in Austin for business or pleasure! "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was pleasant at this central downtown location. This was our first foray with Airbnb and we didn't know what to expect. The unit met our expectations. Loved the option of a basic kitchen. Washer and dryer were unexpected plus. When  neither worked, she came out immediately with a repair person.  While the unit will accommodate up to six, we recommend a max of four.  The unit has wifi but not high speed. Overall, the unit was clean and met our needs. Yogis will love the convenience of a yoga studio across the street."
,,,,,,,,It was my first Airbnb and the whole experience was very impressive. The apartment was excellent and in a perfect location. I'll definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Great location and wonderful condo!   Easy but detailed  instructions from host.  

I highly recommend "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Jaclyn's for three nights and loved the apartment. You can't find a better location, and the pool was a luxurious necessity - it was 95 degrees. Everything was clean and nice. Jaclyn was a very gracious host, leaving us snacks and beer and letting us use the washing machine. The internet connection was a bit slow and kept crashing, but to us, that wasnot a big deal. "
,,,,,,,,"We (6 woman) stayed at Jaclyn's condo during a convention. It was SO lovely & conveniently located to the convention center & MANY amazing restaurants! If we travel to Austin again, we will definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,Great position - dead centre of Austin (which is a great place). Highly recommend this place and Jaclyn was very helpful 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was exactly as described. I did not CAREFULLY read the instructions, and skimmed them on the way. I would encourage guests to not follow my mistake and make sure you read everything in detail before pulling up :). However, Jaclyn immediately returned my phone call and assisted us in getting my car parked and in the apartment. My only two critiques would be the parking spot was a little small and hard to maneuver in and out(my friend did it for me with no problems, I'm not the best driver:), and it got rather warm during the night. However, the condo stay was wonderful. Everything was accurately described and we really enjoyed our stay! We spent all day, one day, at the pool and the location was perfect. We were about a mile from everything we wanted to see/do. We drove to the Brewery and Congress Street, but everything else was super close. The condo had everything we needed from the iron, plenty of towels, 2 vanities and mirror closet made 6 girls staying there more than comfortable. I would love to stay here again in the future and was more than pleased with all of Jaclyn's help and quick responses! She was a wonderful host! "
,,,,,,,,Amazing trip with an amazing host!
,,,,,,,,"The location is amazing. It's right downtown, within walking distance of so many great restaurants and sights. The apartment itself comfortably fit five people for the weekend -- four in the bedroom, one on the pull-out couch in the living room. The kitchen was well-stocked with all sorts of dishes and some snacks, and the bathroom was nice and clean. We definitely spent some time in the apartment complex pool because Austin in August is crazy hot. The only downside is that the wi-fi was a little bit slow. But overall, we had a wonderful time! Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment, great city! Jaclyn was extremely helpful before and during our stay. The apartment was exactly as shown, and very clean. The location is also perfect: walking distance to both Rainey and 6th streets. "
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn was super attentive and very responsive from the the initiation of the rental. The location cannot be beat - walkable to awesome bars and restaurants right around the corner, and a 10 min walk (2 min cab ride) to Rainey. The complex was safe and quiet, with a common pool that saved us from the summer heat on our first day. Her unit was well kept, clean, and comfortably fit 5 girls with plenty of linens and towels to share. Would highly recommend for anyone that needs a clean spot in a prime location!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time at Jaclyn's place.  The location is fantastic, right in the middle of downtown Austin. Everything was clean and comfy."
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn was a great host - very accommodating of our schedules to exchange keys. She even left us some snacks and beer to enjoy over the weekend.

The apartment itself was great. My three friends and I fit comfortably - there's an extra sink and mirror outside of the bathroom to use to get ready. The common area of the apartment is also roomier than the pictures appear in my opinion. 

If you're a light sleeper, this may not be the best place to stay on a busy weekend. We stayed here over the July 4th weekend, and it was incredibly noisy throughout the night - we were woken up multiple times by people having conversations in the common hallways. The only other issue we came across was that the dishwasher did not work, but this wasn't a big deal to us. 

Overall, great place to stay if you want to have a fun weekend. The location was incredibly convenient for everything we wanted to do. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is exactly as pictured and everything is exactly as described! I was very pleasantly surprised and happy just seconds after walking in. The place was clean, cool (since it was June in Texas!), and there were snacks and water to welcome us - perfect when getting in from a late flight with no stores open. The instructions to get in and where things were located were extremely exact and helpful. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was perfect for our group. Great location, exactly as described. Jaclyn has it set up so cute, and went an extra mile and left some food (perfect since we took in red eyes and were starving in the morning) and some local beers to start out weekend off right.  While we did not get to enjoy the pool, it seemed like the cool hang out spot. There's an awesome smoothie place across the street too! Really great location to be in the heart of the action in downtown Austin. We really enjoyed our first experience! Thanks Jaclyn."
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I loved Jaclyn's place! The location was perfect. We walked everywhere - 2nd street shops, East 6th for yummy restaurants, Rainey street for bars, etc, etc. The condo was clean and easily fit 3 people. We took advantage of the pool and met some really nice people. I will definitely stay here the next time I visit Austin. I give Jaclyn's place 5 stars for comfort, coziness, location, and affordability!"
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn's condo was even better than expected!  Comfortable (loved the decor) and extremely clean, with all the amenities of home and close to all this fun ""weird"" city has to offer.  Her provisions were unexpected and very much appreciated.  We had a blast despite the torrential rain this weekend!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay in Jaclyn's condo. The decor was nice and we had all the amenities we might have needed. It is really conveniently located a block from the convention center and lots of restaurants and bars. If I need to come back hopefully I can stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn made us feel so welcome, and had plenty of tips etc for the area. She met us at the apartment with two sets of keys which was really useful. 

The place was PERFECT! The photos don't do it justice. It was just the right size for three of us, and we each got a double bed/sofa.  Jaclyn really goes above and beyond the call of Airbnb duty! Having little extras like a hair dryer, beach towels/towels, and even cotton buds and shampoo actually make a huge difference when you're trying to travel light. She was really accommodating with check in and out, and was happy for us to use all the apartment's facilities. The condo is really cute, and seemed to host a lot of other holiday makers too.  All in all, just great! "
,,,,,,,,"The condo really is perfect in every way.  It is in an ideal location - we walked to everything we wanted to do during our 3 day visit (LBJ museum, UT Campus, downtown, SoCo, and more).  The condo is impeccably clean, very safe, and Jaclyn even left some food and drink for us when we arrived.  She was very communicative throughout but also allowed us privacy during our stay.  We would definitely recommend her place."
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn was amazing! Our flight from New York was delayed and we ended up landing much later than expected. Jaclyn was very accommodating and we were able to get into the apartment with no problems. 

When we arrived, the apartment was clean and well stocked with beer, snacks, plenty of towels, and extra pillows and blankets. The size was exactly what we expected and the location was perfect to walk to 6th street and other attractions throughout the city. 

And just to reiterate how awesome Jaclyn was, we forgot to bring a blow dryer and were unable to find one in the apartment.  We asked Jaclyn if she keeps one around and she said another guest must have misplaced it. Then she showed up less than 10 minutes later with a brand new one! 

Long story short, everything about this experience was excellent and we would do it again in a heartbeat!"
,,,,,,,,Jaclyn's apartment had a PRIME location - great spot to stay at during SXSW! Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"This space was perfect for our trip! 4 girls fit very comfortably in the condo, especially with the extra mirror and sink in the bedroom. The location was fantastic, so close to 6th street, and we walked and used Uber to get everywhere else. Plenty of food and shopping in walking distance. Jaclyn was a fantastic host, she left us local foods and beer upon our arrival and answered our questions very quickly, both before and during our stay. We had the best weekend at this listing. "
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn's place was perfect. It comfortably fit our group of 4 and it was central to everything, couldn't ask for a better location. The apartment was very clean, included all the essential amenities and she even left drinks and snacks for us. She was very responsive when I had questions. Great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and Jaclyn ensured a wonderful experience from beginning to end.  Her responses were prompt and friendly and made me feel like an old friend before I ever even stepped foot in her condo.  A group of five of us stayed at the condo for ACL weekend 1, and I could not have asked for a better location or lodging.  The condo is on 4th street, so all the action of downtown Austin and the ACL shuttle stop were just a few blocks away.  Yet, the condo faces the courtyard of the complex which keeps out any of the noise from the streets.  The condo was both clean and well-supplied; Jaclyn even left some Texas inspired drinks and snacks in the fridge for us! An added bonus that you can't see in the pictures is that there is an extra sink/mirror setup in the bedroom which really helped while getting ready to go out.  As for space, we had more than enough comfortable bedding for our five person group.  Besides the bedroom, both the couch and the recliner were comfy enough to sleep on, and there are also a few of the higher end air mattresses available.  The air mattresses had automatic pumps to inflate and deflate, and while I've slept on some lumpy air mattresses before, I honestly slept like a log while on these.  Members of our party were arriving and leaving at different times, yet Jaclyn was able to accommodate all of our needs without complaint.  She leaves you two keychains to enter the condo complex, and then the entrance to the condo has a keypad which made it very easy for our group to split up at times.  I highly recommend this place to anyone coming to Austin for a festival or looking to enjoy the downtown scene!  "
,,,,,,,,"Jaclyn's place is in a prime location for SXSW and she was an awesome hostess. Great communication prior to flying out and was waiting for us at the apt on arrival. I don't want to set the precedent for all future guests, but when she said she usually likes to throw in a few items from the grocery store, it was quite an understatement compared to the freshly stocked fridge and pantry we were welcomed with. Really made us feel at home.

,,,,,,,,"A great apartment that lived up to the ad. Between the central location, comfortable accommodation for my group and all the coffee we were welcomed to I would gladly make a return trip and rent this space as my home for a week!"
,,,,,,,,"Myself and a group of collegaues were in tow. For a conference at the Austin Convention Center.  We could not have stayed in a more convenient and affordable location as Chads apartment.  Located in a an old railroad warehouse, this modern trendy loft was plenty big for 6 of us.  The ammenities and services available in this spot were of the highest quality.  We very much enjoyed our time staying here."
,,,,,,,,Chad was an incredible host for a guys weekend down in Austin! He welcomed us upon arrival into Austin and made sure that we had everything we needed for the weekend. Would highly recommend his condo for anyone looking for a condo right in the heart of downtown Austin!
,,,,,,,,It was a great time and Chad was so helpful. He helped with some needs around timing and was a gracious host. Would recommend him to anyone looking to stay in the perfect spot on Austin.
,,,,,,,,Chad was very welcoming as a host. He was available if we needed anything and left things in the fridge for us. The place was exactly how it was shown in pictures and highly suggest Chad's apartment for those looking to stay in the Austin area. The place is well kept and has a big living/kitchen for you and friends to hang out. It is in a great area and walking distance to some great spots. This is the place to stay!
,,,,,,,,Welcoming and accurate description 
,,,,,,,," Chad and his place place are wonderful! 

Chad: 
He's extremely responsive, friendly, accommodating with check-in and out times, and left detailed instructions for us. 

His place:
It's in the heart of the city and within walking distance to the quirky hustle and bustle of Rainy Street. It's exactly as it's described and makes you feel right at home. 

My work group went and really enjoyed ourselves. It's a beautiful modern condo, extremely clean, quiet, very secure and provides you with everything you need. We'll definitely stay again the next time we are in Austin! 

"
,,,,,,,,"Chad's place is a two story loft-style condo which is immaculate! Very well detailed, two master bedrooms, a third bedroom with two beds, and two other places where people can sleep if necessary. "
,,,,,,,,"Communicated well from the booking to arrival to departure. Best Airbnb I have stayed at (stayed at approximately 10 in Austin). Great weekend. Location is perfect for getting to the bars and restaurants.
"
,,,,,,,,"Chad was an excellent host! We had 8 guys in town for a bachelor party, and the location was great, very easy to walk to 6th Street and Rainey Street. Chad had some beer and coffee already in the condo when we arrived, that was a nice touch. There was also an issue with the A/C on one day, Chad came over and fixed it quickly. He was very helpful with recommendations on what to do in the city as well. This is the perfect place for a group that wants to come into Austin for a few days and have fun in the downtown area."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location downtown - super easy to slip in and out of. Parking included! We really enjoyed our stay here. Chad was an excellent and very communicative host. Everything was dead-simple and again the location was great for our large group. Thanks again!
,,,,,,,,"Loved stay at Chads! Came with all my sisters and a friend and we had a great time. Very close to everything we wanted. We ate at moonshine (directly behind us), Eddie Vs, partied on 6th street, went to Barton Springs, ate at Terry Blacks BBQ, saw the bats from Cesar Chaves bridge, and went tubing on San Marcos all within walking or short bus trips (Texas tubes has a bus pick up two blocks from Chads)! Austin is an amazing city, plan on going back with significant others and will definitely try booking Chad's place again! He welcomed us with beer and wine, and let us check in early. Thanks for everything! "
,,,,,,,,Called and textd to ensure we were in safely and available when had questions
,,,,,,,,"Loved this place! Would definitely stay here again, as well as recommend to anyone. The place was perfectly clean, updated, and very comfortable. This was my second time to Austin, but I wish we would have stayed here the first time too. Chad, the host was great to work with and very responsive to questions and information to access the home. This location was perfect for a quick walk in any direction to access food and drink, anything else we wanted to do. Thank you Chad for making this stay so easy and allowing us the opportunity to maximize our time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Great place and walking distance to all the cool neighborhoods. Chad is super easy to deal with and made sure we were in the know.
,,,,,,,,The stay at chads place couldn't of been any better. Me and my friends were able to walk to all the bars and restaurants. The apartment was very spacious and slept the 8 of us with no problem. It looked like something out of a catalog. Everything was brand new I would definitely come back and highly recommend for groups.  
,,,,,,,,"Chad was a pleasure to work with and the apartment did not disappoint. Very spacious, super clean and in a fantastic location. The entire trip could not have been easier and the host was responsive and helpful. I could not be happier and I'll be staying here next time I come back."
,,,,,,,,"The place was great!  Super conveniently located, every bit as nice as it looks in the pictures.  Chad made everything run smoothly, and even some welcome beers in the fridge. Not a single complaint."
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved Chad's (URL HIDDEN) was there personally to welcome us. he was kind and understanding to allow us to check in a little early and also check out at our leisure as he didn't have guests the following day.  The apartment was very clean, neat and well organized. The apartment building is gated so it is safe which was very important factor for us girls. The location is awesome as it is in downtown and walking distance to restaurants and bars. Chad's detailed recommendations for restaurants and bars were very helpful as well. He was quick in responding back to our queries and made sure we were at ease. we had a great time and would definitely stay here when we visit Austin again!! "
,,,,,,,,"The accommodations were excellent, and the host was very helpful"
,,,,,,,,"Chad was an exceptional host!  He was communicative, offered to meet me for a tour, left clear and helpful directions and suggestions for what to do in Austin, and provided my group of friends and I with a clean, comfortable, and well-decorated home for the weekend.  There were 8 of us and we fit easily into the apartment.  The location was awesome - right near bars, restaurants, etc.  I highly recommend staying in Chad's properties - I would absolutely love to return!"
,,,,,,,,Chad's info was just what we needed. Centrally located with good bedrooms. Fantastic bathrooms; showers were my favorite part! Ideal location. And just an all around great experience. 
,,,,,,,,"The place is beautiful, very clean and modern. It's right in the heart of town with easy walking access to just about everything, and the parking spot is great if you plan to travel outside the downtown area. My flight left Austin in the evening and Chad was great to let us stick around a few extra hours, since the place wasn't booked the night after our stay. He also knew there was a group coming and left a bottle of wine and a case of Shiners in the fridge, which was appreciated!

Important to note about the Austin Hotel Tax - that's not included in the listed price and AirBnB is not set up to remit this to the city, so you'll get a separate charge after you make the booking for an additional 15%. The listing is complete and accurate, but that is kind of buried down in the details so you might get surprised if you're not paying attention.

"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in the perfect location for walking to tons of bars and restaurants! Chad was a great host! Would definitely reserve again for any returns to Austin!  
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment very close to the Austin Convention Centre. Just a few feet walk. 

The apartment is well equipped with all you need and there is plenty of hot water. 

Chad even welcomed us with beer in the fridge :)"
,,,,,,,,All in all a 10/10 experience. Chad was a responsive communicator and the place was exactly as described. When we arrived it was freshly cleaned and all beds had fresh sheets and towels. The showers even had shampoo / body wash dispensers in them. Would highly recommend this place for your next trip to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Awesome spot in a great location. Everything is just how it looks in the pictures. The apt had anything you might need, including beer. Would def come back again"
,,,,,,,,Everything went very smoothly.  Chad was there to welcome us and show us around.  The apartment was perfect for our business trip. Good modern space with everything we needed.
,,,,,,,,"Great stay all-around. Modern, spacious apartment. Very comfortable and plenty of sleeping space. All necessary amenities, and then some, were provided (towels, coffee, etc.). Host was very responsive. Location cannot be better. Centrally located."
,,,,,,,,"Chad was an excellent host and made myself & my co-workers feel right at home. The place was very clean and well taken care of. All information was clearly laid out for us upon arrival as well as all bedding & towels too. And the location... wow, the location! You honestly couldn't be more centrally located to downtown Austin We were within walking distance to everything! 

To sum it up, I would HIGHLY recommend this rental to anyone as well as the host. "
,,,,,,,,Chad was a great host. He set us up with everything that we needed to for the weekend. The apartment is an awesome space in a great location to visit downtown Austin. I highly recommend it.
,,,,,,,,"This is one of the best locations in Austin downtown.  

Chad welcomed us personally, had the fridge stocked, and we had a drink together while he showed us the place and talked about the area.

We have rented many units in the Railyard and this one is the most well appointed, completely redone.

"
,,,,,,,,"Great for groups! We had a great experience. 

The space was clean, spacious, and comfortable. The gated parking spot came in really handy! The place was just as described (just read the fine print about the tax not being included -- it's easy to miss). 

Chad was available for questions, was easy to talk to and incredibly helpful. He even gave us suggestions of his favorite local places. 

I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,"A group of us stayed here for a guys weekend away and this place is awesome.  It is conveniently located to everything...6th Street and the ACL festival (which we were in town to see).  The condo was spacious, updated with all necessary amenities, and easily fit the 6 people we had.

Chad also made the process very easy with recommendations on places to go and easy ways to get from the airport.  He even stocked the refrigerator with a few beers to get us started.

I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Great location and great place!
,,,,,,,,"It is in a condo complex where the home owner's association approved short term rentals. If you are a price conscious traveler, try other listings in the same building before booking this apartment. If you don't have a very good reason to stay in an apartment, there are many very nice and cost effective hotel rooms as close as across the street or around the block. Chad's is priced much hire than others I saw located in the same building. It is most appropriate for four people (one couple and two singles). Maximum for comfort is three couples. Chad's apartment is nice, very close to the convention center, small and well appointed. There are no windows in the master bedroom. There are three twin size air mattresses in the closet. I'm not sure were you might use them as there doesn't appear extra space except for in an entry way and in front of the open concept living room glass door. 
In addition to the relatively high price, guests are responsible for paying an additional 15% hotel tax chad collects for Austin (read the last line of the property description to find this verbiage). Chad will contact you days before your arrival to collect the city tax. As a host, I pay may city taxes out of my net payment from AirBnb. I consider my approach a different and more client focused way of doing business. Chad ultimately reduced my tax bill and offered me money because the cable went out. 
Air conditioning is a single zone for the main level and master loft. Guests in the master will freeze while guests in downstairs bedrooms sleep more comfortably. If you shut off the air conditioner you may awake in a sweat during the night. 
In terms of hosting, Chad is a pro. You will have a difficult time finding better. He is organized and extremely responsive. The apartment is kept very clean with extra towels. His service level is second to none.
If you are just touring Austin with a choice of other cities to visit, consider NY and SF. You can stay in multi-million dollar properties at similar price points."
,,,,,,,,"Chad was responsive and accommodative from beginning to end, and provided detailed instructions on all fronts. The apartment is absolutely amazing! Exactly as depicted - we were 7 and fit more than comfortably. Having a pool was so great, too. The location is as convenient as it gets if you are looking to explore the main points of interest/areas, we walked to most of them! A true 5 star experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Chad was absolutely amazing from the beginning of the booking to the very end. He was very clear about all the million questions I had and more than that, very prompt and responsive. Even during the trip while Chad was away in Europe, he took the time to answer all the questions I had. 

Moving on to his place, it is beautiful, well kept, and in an amazing location in Austin, close to everything you'd want to be close to. 

I cannot recommend the place enough. If I'm back in Austin again, I'd stay at his place in a heartbeat again!"
,,,,,,,,"Chad was a great host! We had a group of 7 and all had a very comfortable stay. Everything we needed was provided and the location was fantastic. We had guys arriving early and leaving later than the check in/out times, but Chad was very accommodating and flexible. I would definitely consider Chad's place again for another trip back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Chad's place is absolutely amazing, and right across from the convention center, which was perfect for SXSW. His place was comfortable, modern, and stocked with some drinks and snacks when we arrived. If ever in the area again, I'll definitely try and stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This AirBnb is the perfect location in Austin.  Everything is walkable and the new Airport bus (which only costs $1.50 and is just as fast as a cab) stops literally on the corner of the building.  Chad is a good host -- he booked us an incredibly hard to get table at La Condesa (HIGHLY recommended).  He was communicative and friendly, easy to reach when needed.  The apartment was in perfect condition upon arrival.  One important note -- Chad charges an Austin city hotel tax for this AirBnb which is hard to tell from the listing, and he did not tell us until after we booked & paid.  He asked us to pay it in cash/paypal on arrival.  We ended up settling this issue with AirBnb -- who covered the tax for us.  But be sure to connect with him on this issue BEFORE booking, so you know exactly how much money you owe. "
,,,,,,,,"Chad was very responsive, which is great for relieving a lot of the stress if you're staying at his place for business. Pictures didn't do his home justice. Fridge was stocked with brews which was nice for the little downtime that we did have. Would definitely stay again. Thanks for being a great host Chad."
,,,,,,,,"Chad made my first experience on airbnb so smooth that I'd happily use him and/or this site again! The place was in a perfect location, had great accommodations, and Chad made himself accessible too. I'd highly recommend using him if you're an out-of-towner looking to hit up Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Chad was very warm, welcoming and flexible. The apartment is great - we would stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Good location. Chad was very helpful and available. Slightly pricy, but the apartment is good, clean, well furnished and comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"Chad was an awesome host during our stay in Austin. The condo was the perfect setup and size for our party of 6. The location could not have been better,  just two blocks from all the action on 6th and right across the street from a Starbucks. We will definitely stay at Chad's again!"
,,,,,,,,"Chad was super nice and accommodating. He welcomed me at check-in with a full tour, offered some local tips, and was easily reachable via text.

I stayed here for 5 days during a conference and it was the perfect home base throughout the day and at night for me and two co-workers.

The master suite is especially comfortable, with a huge bathroom and a room that is completely isolated from noise and light at night. The entire apartment has been beautifully remodeled and is a noticeable upgrade compared to the units around it. Even small touches are there--lots of lighting with dimmers, entertainment system with master remote, and a magnetic induction stove top."
13140432,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"One word: Gorgeous! I was so wowed by Kimberly's guest home that I wished I lived there! Everything in the home is modern, creative, and beautiful. There are so many details and special touches that make you feel right at home. I spent my birthday in Austin this year and coming back to this wonderful space was the cherry on top. If you're visiting Austin, you will be lucky if you get to snatch this place! A big thank you to Kimberly for making my stay so special."
,,,,,,,,"Kimberly's place is BEAUTIFUL, centrally located, and even better than the photos. She communicated flawlessly and her home left us inspired! Definitely our favorite AirBnB experience to date. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, really beautiful. Kimberly was a great host."
,,,,,,,,"Kimberly welcomed us to her place with a friendly note and a nice list of great local restaurants, coffee shops, and spots to grab a local brew.  Fresh flowers, light snacks, and cold beverages were awaiting us, as well.  Kimberly definitely has the guest's needs in mind.  The Bradley House has a modern, contemporary design and eclectic style.  Honestly, it was immaculate!  The guest house is very private and beyond comfortable.  We had everything we needed to enjoy our stay in Austin!    Kimberly also provided great communication checking in with us before our arrival and inquiring about our needs during the stay.   It is an amazing neighborhood close to Lamar and South Congress, which are packed with trendy restaurants and shops.  We were able to walk, bike, and take short Fasten (local Uber) rides to our destinations.  There are beautiful biking/running trails nearby along the Colorado River, as well. We would highly recommend staying at The Bradley House to family and friends!  Thanks for everything Kimberly!  "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic accomadation 
5 stars all the way "
,,,,,,,,"Kimberly was incredibly responsive and very sweet, accommodating and helpful. The 2 bedroom was so clean, an amazing, cute and funky place. I would definitely stay here again on my next stay in Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"The Bradley House was great, Kimberly was more than accommodating. Made us feel very welcome and great communication. House is just a walk or 5 minute taxi which is very nice. Thanks for everything. "
,,,,,,,,"The Bradley house is a serene and gorgeously decorated hideaway in the middle of one of the busiest parts of Austin. Quiet, private, bright and thoughtfully decorated with high quality furniture and fixtures you couldn't have hoped for more even if you were staying at a boutique hotel. Lovely private deck for dining and hanging out under the string lights. Beautiful attention to detail and thoughtful touches throughout. Would love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Just a terrific experience and a wonderful place to stay while in Austin for the film festival. Spotless, stylish, secluded, spectacular."
,,,,,,,,Absolutely wonderful stay here.  Comfy contemporary design with excellent modern amenities and facilities. Comfortable beds and quiet locale. Kimberly was a great hostess. Great location as well for ACL. Would absolutely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"This was a luxurious air bnb experience. The house is perfect, location could not be better, and the hosts are so kind. The pictures do not do it justice even! The house has everything you need and more. We had a group of 5 and all fit comfortably. A group of us were in Austin for ACL and while we had fun at the festival the best part of the trip was definitely the air bnb experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Kimberly has an incredible place in a quiet, but trendy neighborhood. It is walking distance to good bbq, nightlife and a great park. The house was meticulous and Kimberly goes above and beyond to ensure you have a great stay. We arrived late at night and Kimberly was very accommodating. She even had the fridge stocked with local brews and wine! I would highly recommend staying here if you have a group of 3-6 people. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was great for our girls trip to Austin. It was just the right amount of space and we loved the modern decor. The private deck was a perfect place to hang out and relax. Kim was a great host. She was helpful, responsive, and accommodating. I've stayed at many Airbnbs and this was the best experience. I would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great property and location. Very comfortable for 3 people. Close to Zilker park So. Congress. Nicely designed modern furnishings and decor. Has everything you need including a fridge full of goodies, water, Nespresso machine and wifi. Our host was very attentive. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at the Bradley Guest House with two friends and my husband over Labor Day weekend.  The house is just as beautiful as the photos, if not more, and Kimberly was a great host leaving us local drinks to try, as well as snacks and recommendations of how to enjoy Austin.  We all loved the decor of the guest house and didn't want to leave - even the pullout couch was comfortable.  We will definitely try to return! "
1456594,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,This condo was perfect for my group that was in town for a conference. The place was very clean and all rooms had a great sized bed! The location was perfect for having access to everything downtown. It was gated and felt perfectly safe. I would highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean, spacious, very easy to access, and comfortable. The best feature is its location, which is extremely central, close to the downtown bars, the Capitol, the convention center, hotels, and business area. I would recommend to families or groups of friends traveling to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Neighborhood was right where we wanted to be in the middle of all the action in downtown Austin. everything was walking distance and easy to access. Getting there from the airport was a breeze as well because a public bus drops off just around the corner. Vannak made everything so easy. I even was able to ship something to the address and he left it inside the unit for me. The place was so clean, had three wonderful bedrooms all with Queen beds which was perfect for the group I visited with. Plenty of clean towels, bedding, shampoo, etc. was provided and the kitchen had everything you needed to feel right at home. "
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is perfect! Great location, everything you can possibly need (shampoo in the showers, towels, pots and pans, basic cooking needs like salt, pepper, olive oil, etc)! They really have thought of everything. You are minutes away from all the great places to eat and go out in Austin. Also Vannak was nice enough to let us check in early because of an early flight and was very communicative leading up to and before our stay. I loved Austin and definitely want to go back, and when I do I want to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"I would give ten stars if I could. Everything was perfect: location downtown, instructions to enter, apartment cleaner than any hotel I have ever stayed in, everything provided -- great beds and bedding, coffee and filters, some bottles of water in fridge, equipment and spices in case we wanted to cook, cleaning supplies, plenty of towels  -- it all just could not have been better. A big TV in the living room and in the master bedroom, washer and dryer with detergent provided, brochures and magazines about Austin, even a board game and some books. I was worried about the possible noise because we were so close to the nightlife -- but I never heard a thing. Thanks so much to Vannak and Veronica for a wonderful three-day Austin experience despite the rain."
,,,,,,,,We cannot rave enough about this place and our experience in Austin! The place was exactly as shown/described. Just a short walk away to lots of shops/restaurants/bars - - - perfect location in downtown.  Vannak was an extremely great & responsive host with wonderful restaurant recommendations - - - especially Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden. Any questions we had we felt comfortable texting him and he responded in a timely manner. Staying here just made our trip to Austin that much more enjoyable. We love Vsquared!
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed in this neat and clean apartment just 30 seconds away from the conference center. Our hosts were easy to get in touch with and gave us all the information we needed in a timely manner. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a very convenient place for us to stay while we attended a conference at the Austin convention center, which is right across the street. The apartment was clean, comfortable and close to restaurants and bars. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Vannak and Veronica's unit was fantastic. The unit is comfortable and clean and provided more than enough space for us. They were even kind enough to provide things like shampoo. The kitchen is also socked with things like dishes, coffee, and a variety of spices in case you're in the mood to cook...though in this city there is plenty to keep your stomach happy and full. Also, don't be fooled by the Starbucks across the street...a couple blocks toward Congress and there's Houndstooth, or Jo's and Austin Java are on 2nd. All worth the nice, short walk. We definitely agree with the amazing walk score. Everything from Rainey St to the Capitol and the Warehouse District to East 6th is easily accessible. South Congress (south of the river) is a bit more of a hike, but definitely doable for most. One day we walked from the capitol to Allen's Boots and back to the unit. If walking is not your thing, then there are plenty of pedicabs throughout the city (which have taken hold since the exile of uber and lyft). We did not use this service, but they're always around. We had a couple minor issues with parking...or rather, people parking in our spot. Luckily Vannak either has multiple units, or knows the other units of the realtor he works with so we were able to instantly have a place to park (where we wouldn't be towed) while our space was freed up. There are two strict rules with this complex. (1) Noise - you are told this upfront and there is a notice posted. Some tenants ignore it (uncommon)...I'm not sure if they were fined or not, but it is still something to be mindful of unless you want to pay and extra $500 per complaint. (2) Parking - there are many notices about assigned parking...they will tow you, we've seen...and instigated it. Everything else is basic and clearly listed. Vannak was always available when we needed him and quick to offer suggestions and be as helpful as possible. Great guy, great unit, win-win."
,,,,,,,,"10/10
Absolutely fantastic place to stay. Great location, beautiful apartment, wonderful hosts. Cannot thank Vannak & Vanessa enough for everything they did for us. They went above & beyond to provide the perfect stay. They gave us a list of things to do in Austin. When they found out we were travelling with our 1 year old, they kindly lent us their portacot, high chair, stroller & left baby food, toys, wipes & baby products for us to use. We were blown away by their generosity.
They apartment itself is amazing - big, spacious & clean. Great communication right from the start.
Thank you again, so much, for making our time in Austin so easy & comfortable!"
,,,,,,,,"Wow. This was a perfect accommodations for a fast and fun filled weekend in Austin. Great location, pristine condition, comfy beds and free parking too. Loved everything. We will be coming back!"
,,,,,,,,"Vannak and Veronica were terrific hosts! I had mentioned that I was bringing my baby, and they provided many extras just for her (even diapers) -so thoughtful! There were also extra touches for the adults, including snacks. The condo was great, very clean and as advertised. Great location.  We would definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Vannak was a great host!  He was very responsive to questions and provided many great suggestions for what to do in the area.  The place was exactly as described and we had everything we needed and more! 
"
,,,,,,,,"Vannak and Veronica made us feel right at home and were easy to contact.
Their place is right near all the nightlife and perfect if you want to go for a morning run along the river."
,,,,,,,,"This was a great hub for us in Austin. The place is clean and modern, very clean, and in a great location. The owners were wonderful with communication and with flexibility of letting us drop off our bags early. 

The apartment is right near 6th Street and SoCo, and the parking spot put it over the top. It was a perfect apartment to share with friends."
,,,,,,,,"This condo location is perfect! We were able to walk everywhere- to soco, the capitol, minutes away from dirty sixth and a close walk to the bars on Rainey street. My friends and I really enjoyed staying at Vannak's condo. There were water bottles waiting for us in the condo. 

The condo itself is very clean and spacious. The bedrooms are exactly as depicted and we enjoyed staying here. 

Vannak is an awesome host. He responded quickly to my emails. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here in Austin and would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Vannak was very responsive while during our stay. He was flexible with allowing us to drop our stuff off early as we checked out of another condo the same day and let us leave our bags until we were heading to the airport. The condo was just as pictured with many amenities. The kitchen was stocked with many pans, coffee, sugar, spices, and many other useful items. The bathrooms were beautiful and perfect for 4 or 6 people. The internet wifi had great signal strength and one guest of my party was able to work from the condo. The location was excellent and we were able to walk to just about any restaurant we wanted. The Uber transit system was fantastic and was very affordable. We took the capital metro 100 bus to and from the airport, the bus stop is visible from the condoâ€™s front steps. 
One downfall is that the condos are wall to wall causing water noise to echo throughout. The hosts were clearly aware and provided many sets of earplugs which were utilized each night we were there. 
Overall you will not regret choosing this condo, the location is perfect and the condo was spacious. 
"
,,,,,,,,"I was in Austin for a girls weekend and we felt lucky to have found this place! It is just like the pictures - clean, stocked with things you need and good amount of space. Vannak and Veronica had nice little touches like water bottles and face wipes. They were very accommodating and let us check in early. This was our first visit to Austin and we were really close to all the things we wanted to see. If you are in town for a convention, this place would also be perfect. We were walking distance to 6th street nightlife, coffee shops, some great bars and restaurants. The bus from the airport drops off right outside the door, which is convenient. I would definitely recommend it and would stay there again myself. "
,,,,,,,,"Clean, comfortable, and centrally located. This place was convenient to get to and a perfect fit for our stay in downtown Austin. I was here with two of my colleagues for a conference and Vannak and Veronica's apartment was ideal. The only thing I'd say is that it is on the first floor. It wasn't loud at all but the windows were right on street level. For us, this wasn't a big deal but for some it could be. All in all, I'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful visit to Austin and the rental was perfect.   The location was ideal, two blocks from 6th street.  The condo was very clean and the layout was perfect for our group of 4 adults and one baby.  Would recommend this condo to anyone staying in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"This is a perfect location for anyone visiting Austin! We were taking a company trip and trying to find a conveniently located apartment that would allow us the ability to walk to all of our dinners, hit the nightlife, as well as cook a few meals during our stay- this place exceeded expectation. 

The apartment was clean, had three sizable bedrooms. The dining room was a bit smaller but also fed into the living room where we ate most meals- we had four individuals so the size worked out well. 

If you are planning to take a trip and want to be in the heart of Austin I suggest staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"Vannek and Veronica were excellent hosts! They were super responsive and accommodating, and the condo is exactly as it's presented in the listing. 

We were within walking distance of everything we could possible want: great bars and restaurants, fun shops, a liquor store, etc. We were in town for a wedding and the condo was also within walking distance of the hotel where other guests/wedding party was staying, but gave us some space and privacy from all the wedding-related chaos. :-)

I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Our reservations were done by email. It was very easy and I quickly received replies. We got the gate and house codes by email 
,,,,,,,,"We loved this Airbnb!  It was very clean with everything we needed for a comfortable stay for 3 couples.  The location was absolutely perfect for a stay in downtown Austin & a nice walk to the river trail.  Vannak was wonderful, so responsive & helpful.  He even found an extra parking place for us in the complex & was so flexible & thoughtful to let us stay past our check out time day of departure due to terrible weather with torrential flooding rains & tornado warnings, wanting it to be safe for us to leave.  Thank you so much!  We would highly recommend this Airbnb!
"
,,,,,,,,"Vannak and Veronica made us feel welcome from our first correspondence.  They answered all of our questions and did their best to accomodate our early arrival and late departure.  We were able to check in early and although we could not check out later, we were able to leave our luggage in the condo so we could have one last day of fun in Austin.  Vannak was very easy to communicate with.  He always returned my emails within a short period of time and even gave me his cell phone # in case I needed an immediate response. The condo was immaculate and fully equipped with towels and toiletries.  There were even waters in the refrigerator and bananas on the counter.  It was very centrally located.  We walked everywhere.  I would highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, instructions, clean condo for six.  Would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,Great location! Very convenient to walk to all my favorite downtown Austin places. Very spacious and comfortable as well!
,,,,,,,,"Awesome spot, Vannak was super helpful prior to arrival made everything easy. The apartment is great  and in an AMAZING location if you're looking to run around downtown Austin. Highly recommended"
,,,,,,,,"Awesome! Everything as described!
Not without a reason this is Superhost!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was better than the pictures. Pin code entry and exit so you are not dependent on Vannak for collecting or returning keys. Clean, spacious, great location."
,,,,,,,,Everything was exactly as described. Perfect location. Big and spacious. Clean and tidy. Very happy with our accommodations and our hosts were friendly and responsive. Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"It was a great experience. The hosts were responsive, and even got us an air mattress. The location is fantastic and the accommodations were clean, simple, and exactly what we were looking for. If you want to be in the center of the action, this is the spot!

Will definitely rent again!"
,,,,,,,,"Host was very friendly, pleasant, and accommodating.  The listing was very accurate.  We had the best experience.
"
,,,,,,,,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this condo.  The location was great-you are truly in the middle of everything!! We walked to most of the places we wanted to go.  the condo itself is immaculate.  The bedrooms are large and the beds very comfortable.  Living and dining areas are compact but worked fine for us as we were gone most of the time.  Well equipped kitchen with nice standard sized refrigerater.  Parking is in a gated, covered parking lot with a reserved space.  Most important to me was the A/C worked great!  We stayed there in the middle of July.  The reservation process was quick and easy.  The directions for accessing the property to begin your stay are well laid out and easy to follow (even for us older travelers..).  I will most definitely stay there again.  We had a great experience.  That's  about it.  Thanks!!"
,,,,,,,,"We had very nice stay at Vannak and Veronica's place. Is a small apartment with good size rooms.  We were a group of 6 adults and we didn't bump into each other.  at all. When we communicated with them we asked how close was the Convention Center? (since all of our activities were there) they said it was next door, when we arrived, the CC was literally across the street. The apartment is very well located, you can find food and amenities at a walking distance. Vannak went above and beyond getting us another place to park since we had two vehicles, we are very thankful for that. All in all awesome experience."
,,,,,,,,"Vannak was a great host. He was very quick to respond to all questions before and during the stay. The description for the apartment was accurate. It's a clean, modern place that's very adequate for three couples. The common space is not large but served us well for congregating briefly as we planned our next Austin adventure. The location was ideal for getting out to different parts of town, especially the popular spots on 6th street and Congress. I'd recommend it for anyone who will be spending a lot of time downtown. "
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at  Vannak and Veronica's condo. It was a great location right in downtown. We were able to walk to so many places. Vannak answered questions very quickly.  It was very comfortable for our family with 2 teenage boys and my husband and I. Would definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,"This house exceeded our expectations, which were high to begin with. It's an excellent location downtown, a quick walk to Congress Ave and the bats under the bridge, many good restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Really comfortable beds; all is immaculately kept. Hosts provided us with a good list of their recommended places to eat and visit, etc. Off street parking a real plus. Excellent value for a downtown airbnb. "
,,,,,,,,"Had a wonderful time in the condo.  Had all the essentials and was located in a perfect spot that was walking distance to several attractions.  There were water bottles in the fridge which was a saving grace after a night on Rainey St.  
There was some trouble with the master shower (handle was stripped on the inside,  normal wear and tear).  Vannak responded immediately and came to the unit to remedy the issue.
I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Vannak was very communicative and the house was exactly as described in the ad - much appreciated.

This is a perfect unit to be close to everything downtown and is very efficient for multiple people given the code-driven entry system. 

The living area is rather small but comfy and totally feasible to hang out in before you head out for the evening. 

This would be an A+ location for SXSW or any of the other Austin festivals, fwiw."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean, spacious, and perfectly located downtown. The access was convenient and the parking was perfect. Would highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"We all loved the apartment! It was a super convenient location.  Spacious enough for 5 of us.  The space was clean and well stocked with incidentals. 
Hosts were extremely accommodating and always replied quickly to any question we had.  Would totally recommend this place in the future."
,,,,,,,,"Great 3 bedroom, 2 full bath unit. Close to restaurants, bars and the convention center. There were five of us and the space worked well. Small kitchen/sofa area, washer and dryer in unit, parking was super easy and convenient! Some street noise at night but nothing overwhelming. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Vannak and Veronica were great hosts. Water and wine were waiting for us in the refrigerator, bananas on the counter. Internet connection was easy. The apartment was clean and the towels were fluffy. The bedrooms are a nice size with plenty of drawer and closet space. The living space and kitchen area is small but efficient.  They communicated with us when necessary and kept us apprised of building issues. 
The location couldn't be better! We walked every where.  The building parking lot is easy to use and having two entrances/exits made our car trips simple too. Traffic in the area was very light. That could have been due to the Holiday. 
All in all a great vacation rental for us."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great for our party of three adults, each of whom needed a separate bedroom.  It's a fantastic location right downtown, yet with very convenient access to major thoroughfares (if you want to sample Austin's best BBQ joints, food trucks, and other local joints, you're going to be driving), a reserved parking spot (key, since Austin is building up quickly and parking can be tight), walkable to several of the biggest entertainment areas, and just a few blocks from fantastic running/walking trails right on the Colorado river.

Keep in mind that this is an urban apartment -- it's not huge. But the common area is very nicely appointed, and it's great value for money, especially if you'll be using all three bedrooms. Originally we toyed with staying outside of downtown at cheaper hotels, and we were SO glad we came here instead. It's a great setup for what I am guessing is the most popular ""AirBnB use case"": a pleasant, affordable place to sleep in a fantastic location for a good price. We spent some time lounging around in the early mornings and late nights, but for the most part, we were out exploring the city.

We dealt with Vannak in making the arrangements, and I couldn't rate his responsiveness or helpfulness any higher. He always responded promptly to my emails, was flexible with some arrangements for our stay, and sent me a great list of tailored recommendations for us.

Overall, very highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"The location of this condo could not have been better. We walked to several amazing restaurants, shopping and fun things to do. We found the condo immaculate and the owners had it very well stocked for us. 
It is very convenient to public transportation so you can get anywhere in the City very easily. Our party consisted of 3 adult couples and we found it very comfortable for our group. Look forward to staying here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great condo and wonderful hosts. The apartment was spotless and very comfortable. It was one of the few places with dedicated parking, but it was so central to downtown that we walked everywhere. "
,,,,,,,,"This was too easy! Great location, cute space and fantastic hosts. Vannak really went out of his way to be accommodating. He sent some general recommendations but also provided insider tips specific to the purpose of our trip. Hosts were easily accessible and super prompt in any reply. Thanks, V2!"
,,,,,,,,Vannak and Veronica couldn't have been more accommodating hosts. They replied quickly to emails and went above and beyond to make sure we had a comfortable stay. The condo was in a great location and our group of 6 girls enjoyed ourselves immensely. Would recommend to friends and stay again!!
,,,,,,,,"Can't say enough good things about Vannak - his hospitality was the epitome of 'above and beyond'. Case in point: a member of our group was driving cross country with a uhaul trailer. I asked Vannak a good place to park it while we stayed downtown. Not only did he offer a suggestion, he  let us park at his own home while he was out of town. Super helpful, super responsive, my hope in humanity is renewed!

Place was great - clean, nicely appointed, and super convenient location. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Vannack & Veronic's condo was great. Very clean and well stocked for our 6-person visit. Vannack was very helpful and communicative before our stay, even helping us figure out parking for an additional car. The location was perfect and we were able to walk to everything in downtown Austin. Definitely recommend this great condo if you're looking for a great place to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,We felt very welcomed! There were water bottles in the fridge which was a wonderful touch and made the transition very easy and pleasurable. The directions on how to get in and out of the apt were perfect and easy. There were plenty of towels for everyone. The beds were all very comfortable. Everything was clean and seemed well kept. 
,,,,,,,,"The Condo was perfect!  Due to flight times, I arrived early and checked out late. They were very accommodating to my needs (so grateful).  The bus from the airport dropped me off across the street and cost $1.50, a friend took a cab that cost $38.00. My roommate drove and parking was very expensive our last trip to Austin. The parking spot saved her quite a bit. We came to attend training at the Downtown Hilton which was one short block away.  Everything we needed was within walking distance, no need to rent car.  We loved the food and music that Austin offers and could not have asked for more with the accommodations.  
Thank you     
"
,,,,,,,,"The location (*right* beside the convention center) was excellent. The place was spotless and the host communicated with us promptly each time I reached out.

Vannak was also a model of good customer service when we experienced a problem. We required solid Internet connectivity while were there since all of us have websites to maintain even while we are at conferences.

Unfortunately, the Internet that was included with the room was that supplied by the homeowner association and thus is shared by the entire complex. At night when we returned from the conference and had to get work done (and even during the day on several days) we experienced extremely poor transfer rates. In some cases we could not reach websites we needed to do our work. One of our team tethered his phone to get his deployment done and completely broke through his data plan.

Vannak recognized early the degree of breakdown it was to have three tech workers without solid Internet connectivity and moved quickly to assess the situation. Ultimately he proactively refunded us a portion of our fee because there was nothing he could do in the timeframe we had. We are applying that to the expensive data plan overage.

I'm perfectly willing to give him 5 stars because of his excellent customer service. However, if you absolutely must have solid Internet connectivity while you are there you should not expect it unless Vannak installs a dedicated line to the unit. In the very least make sure your cellphone data plan and your tethering software is ready as a backup before you arrive.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great host and nice location for whatever you want to do in Austin.  My first time there and we were able to walk to most everything.  Only bonus would have been a pool, but you pay for what you get.

"
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay in Austin, and Vannak and Veronica were excellent hosts.  Their apartment was beautiful, clean and comfortable, and perfectly located so that we could explore Austin both on foot and by car.  I highly recommend these hosts and their apartment as a place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,The condo was clean and in a perfect location in downtown Austin.  Vannak and Veronica were helpful and communicative hosts.  I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Great condo in downtown Austin.  Well appointed, very clean, and comfortable.  Walking distance to just about everything.  Hosts are very helpful with recommendations, tips, and answering any questions.  Highly recommended!  Would definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, excellent location, responsive host.  Loved it."
,,,,,,,,"A beautiful space, close to 6th Street and several other downtown locations.  V2 were excellent hosts!  

The instructions provided prior to our arrival were very clear.  We were easily able to get into the condo.  When we got in, the space was clean, open, and very welcoming.

Vannak and Veronica were exceptionally responsive to an issue with the water being turned off for some building repairs...even though it was out of their control.

Would definitely recommend both this condo and V2!"
5123540,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Brent our host did an excellent job communicating with us prior to our trip to make our check-in process seamless. The house was absolutely wonderful and close proximity (no more then a 10 min drive) to Zilker Park, Barton Springs, Town lake, Rainey Street and South Congress. 
The house comfortably fit 3 couples. The host had graciously laid out towels and toiletries for our stay. Favorite parts about the house was decor and space. The backyard was great for playing ping pong or soccer and we were lazy a few days and hung out on the porch swing in the front in the afternoons. Would recommend this place to anyone who is coming to Austin to take in what the city has to offer."
,,,,,,,,"Brent was very nice, provided a tour of the house, showed me how to connect to his music system. 

Each bathroom had a travel kit with shampoo conditioner body wash and lotion which was great and the house was very clean overall. 

Great home with a nice 60s decor. The highlight of the house was the backyard particularly the concrete ping pong table which is nicely equipped with an array of paddles and balls. Music is also set up to be outside which is key. 

House was nicely located in the upscale Clarksville neighborhood about 1.5-2 miles from the heart of Austin. However within walking distance of the house are many great restaurants and stores which is really convenient.  

Overall a great stay and would definitely do it again.

1743317,4.5,8,9,9,10,10,9,The perfect location if you are looking to do all the Austin essentials.  
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great, would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was OK, nothing to write home about. It met the needs of our group (3 people on a business trip). It was a little tight (only 2 beds and a pull-out couch), so I don't know how it could really fit 4 like the description says.

There was laundry left in the washer/dryer when we arrived. The location was great, close to restaurants/bars/downtown.

The listing says ""essentials"" and ""shampoo"" are included, however when we arrived, the shower items were empty (containers still there though), so we needed to go out and purchase those.

Not a big deal, but worth noting."
,,,,,,,,Amazing location and great communication - very cool condo and well worth the money!
,,,,,,,,Smooth check-in process. Sandeep was helpful and responsive whenever we needed him. 10/10 would stay again!
,,,,,,,,Great location!
,,,,,,,,"The apartment provided us with what we needed. Sandeep was very responsive and sent a handyman when we found some problems with the apartment. Though we didn't stay around this area too much, it is a great location for those who want to be around bars/restaurants/clubs.  "
,,,,,,,,"I would recommend anybody that wants to stay in Austin to steer as far away from AustinStays' listings as possible. The host basically baited and switched in terms of the cost. After accepting our request to stay, the host ask us for MORE money and  Airbnb didn't do anything to help with this situation. Further to this, the host had absurd checkout rules, asking us to take out the trash wash all the dishes by HAND. I don't think this is acceptable considering we already paid the cleaning fees."
,,,,,,,,The owner was super nice and accommodating!
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect. It isn't huge, but you can't expect to get the square footage when you have such a premium location. We were in the middle of it all. Utilize the bus passes you can purchase on your phone with the app and you can get anywhere in the city (including the airport) in no time at all. The pool is small and quaint. We will definitely try and stay here again on our next visit!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed here for a conference at the convention center and the location was perfect! The apartment is centrally located, close to 6th street and Rainey street. The apartment was very nice and clean, and 4 people slept comfortably here. The loft and high ceilings make the apartment feel more roomy. Thanks for letting us stay, we had a great time."
,,,,,,,,Everything was as stated and had a great time! Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Austinstays provided quality communication which made the whole process extremely easy. As well as this, additional information and recommendations on things to do in Austin were provided. The location of the condo is perfect, just two atreets from the 6th street bars & close to other venues."
,,,,,,,,"Overall we had a great time.  The location is in the heart of Austin with great restaurants, bars, etc. in the neighborhood.  

The condo in the picture was not the condo we stayed at.  There was no spiral staircase and the interior was completely different.  We were definitely disappointed with the accuracy of the listing because we specifically chose this place for the condo's character. 

That said, the condo we received was fine and had an extra bathroom.  The place was clean and the host was very communicative leading up to and during the stay.  He gave us good recommendations and everything went very smoothly.  Check in was on the later side and check out was on the earlier side but all in all it was a good stay."
,,,,,,,,"Extremely convenient to the convention center, 6th street, Rainey Street, and the Congress Avenue Bridge. Great restaurants and coffee shops nearby. However, though our apartment was very spacious, it looked nothing like the pictures. This wasn't an issue at all, just a little jarring, and might bother others. Also extremely thin outer walls and windows...you can hear everything outside"
,,,,,,,,"Myself and a few colleagues were down in Austin for a conference. The apartment was great, it was big, modern and comfortably slept the four of us. We were walking distances to great restaurants on Rainy St. and the lively nightlife on 6th street. 

Had a good experience, the host had great communication and provided all the necessary information to get into the complex, door codes, etc.  I would definitely recommend this apartment.

"
,,,,,,,,Location was superb and entrance and leaving procedure easy to follow. The property was clean.  We had a few maintenance issues as a number of lights and sockets did not work there was an offer to resolve but as we were only there 2 nights we did not want the disruption. A kettle and it toaster would have been helpful and the oven was dirty. This is clearly a business rather than the traditional Airbnb experience and the lack of personal touches such as a basic welcome pack and bathroom essentials were missing . We have have to say however the location made up for this .
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay!! Great apartment, centrally located! Wonderful, communicative host. Would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Incredible location, clean and cozy.
Highly recommend for a group for 2-4 looking to be in the heart of downtown Austin. The hosts were responsive and helpful. Plan ahead for the 10am checkout.

"
,,,,,,,,"Great Location with a friendly host. Was in town for a real estate conference and found this apartment conveniently located near all that i needed to do. The host was great, and I would stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"The location is really great, close and convenient to a lot of great bars, shopping, and activities. The unit was very clean and a comfortable stay. I'm not sure it's large enough for more than 3 people, it's a bit small for groups larger than that given there is only 1 bathroom to share, but all in all, it's a great place!"
,,,,,,,,"The host was very accommodating.  We were able to get an early check in and the host provided a lot of good details on things to do in the area.  The airbnb is very close to ""Dirty Sixth"" aka the college party scene which we weren't really into, but the location would be great if that was what you were looking for."
,,,,,,,,"This condo is very close to night life, restaurants, and the convention center. The unit was clean and the listing accurate. The wifi provided was a little slow and would go out occasionally, this wasn't a big deal as we weren't in the condo much. Overall a very good experience.  "
,,,,,,,,"Sandeep and his assistant Amber helped answer all my questions before my stay. They were quick to respond, and cleared up any points of confusion I had. The property was as described and in clean, good condition. It is a small, but efficiently used and well-decorated space.

The location of the apartment is ideal for those looking to walk around the downtown area and 6th Street, in particular. The included parking spot is a great bonus, as it is hard to find parking in such a busy area. I had not been to Austin before my stay, and staying at Sandeep's place was ideal as I could walk to most places. He even sent me a list of restaurants/bars/things to do before I arrived, which was very helpful.

Our stay, and our experience with the hosts, was fantastic. Would recommend to others."
,,,,,,,,"AustinStays was a good experience for the price! They were prompt in responding and professional about everything through the process. There were not any luxuries in the bnb, but we were going for cost-effective, which this definitely was. I recommend it. The only drawback were the large groups of very loud yuppies on weekend nights. We had been trying to sleep with the windows open because of the heat, and these groups of drunk 20-somethings were making a ruckus until after 3 am. But there's not much you can do about noisy bachelor/bachelorette parties anyplace you stay. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect- in a great quiet location within walking distance to 6th st, Rainey St and SoCo as well as great restaurants and blues clubs. Definitely recommend this place and would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Very well located as it's just a few minutes walk from the most popular streets to go out to in downtown Austin. Would recommend taking the Capital Metro bus from the airport ($1.75) if time permits. Instructions from host were easy to follow and takes about an hour or so to figure out where everything is, how the systems work etc. The rooms were clean and well supplied with basic toiletries. The only caveat is that there is one bathroom that can only be accessed by going through the main bedroom, which means that bedroom won't have complete privacy. Would recommend as a moderately priced alternative to a hotel with more common area space."
,,,,,,,,"Great place and good communication on arrival details. Would have been nice to use the dishwasher, but that's a nit. Would stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,The host was very nice and very helpful and responds quickly. The location was as advertised; close to 6th street clean and working amenities. I would defintely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Locaton was as advertised; close to 6th street, clean and working amenities. 

Check-in was easy and had no issues with instructions for entry codes and location of actual apartment within the complex. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and communication from the owner. Would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,As advertised. Great location!
,,,,,,,,"The place was great. The ad accurately depicted the condo and there were no surprises. The instructions we received from the owner prior to arrival were clear and helpful. If you're looking for a place to stay that puts you in the heart of everything Austin has to offer, you'll find it a this condo. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location near the convention center.
Our host was detailed about everything and very helpful.
The unit is small - great for 3-4 people  - 6 is doable but tight.
"
,,,,,,,,"The condo was clean, easily accessible, and good value for the number of guests. The host was well-organised and provided clear instructions. It is very close to Downtown and walking distance for the majority of what we wanted to do. This was a working trip for the Convention Centre. My only niggle is that the pool is in the apartment block across the road."
,,,,,,,,"Great place in the heart of Austin, 5min from 6th street. Disapointment concerning the 6 sleep, only one room and one BA. No table where to eat. Pictures are reflecting well the appt and place needs to be better described. Situated in a condo essentially with students, this is adequate for sleep only. Checkin and ou very well organized. Parking ok."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and good facilities. Being able to do laundry within the apartment was really helpful for my overall trip. It's 'cosy' though - we had 4 staying and it's a good job we were really good friends as the single bathroom is ensuite to the downstairs bedroom... But the quality, ease of access, location and everything left us with an overall positive feeling. Communication from the host was really clear and timely, made for a very smooth trip."
,,,,,,,,"This listing is exactly as described - centrally located, clean, and easy to access. I received very clear instructions on how to get in and out of the unit, and we didn't need our hosts for anything, although they contacted us a few days before with the instructions, and I felt like being available was definitely a priority for them. There were 3 in our group, and the condo is very well-sized for that many people, but there is only one bathroom, and I think any more in our party would have been a bit of a squeeze. However, it was perfect for what we needed, and I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Sandeep provided a good place with the location we needed. Everything was very professional. The condo was comfortable and clean. 
,,,,,,,,Great location in downtown! Like seriously couldn't be a better location and great that there was parking at the condo. The place was clean and comfortable too. I was there only for a convention but there was a kitchen so you could easily cook meals for a family vacation!
,,,,,,,,"Great location for a fun weekend in Austin. The unit came with plenty of towels and bedding for four people, and the included parking was great!"
,,,,,,,,The host was very professional and organized with details of the apartment complex as well as the surrounding area.  The apartment we were given access to was not the apartment shown in the original listing but this was never described to us.  It was only when I asked Sandeep after our stay did he explain there was a mix up and we were given a different apartment.  The new apartment was satisfactory for our needs.
,,,,,,,,"The location was great, walking distance to tons of places to eat and drink. The place was a lot smaller than we thought from the pictures but that's often the case. It was clean and had all the amenities although the Internet was really slow and there weren't a lot of dishes etc. it was small for 4 ppl (and one bathroom to share and the upstairs was loft style so not a lot of privacy) but I could see this work well for a family with children and would generally recommend the place. A bit strict on the check out policy (10am and the cleaning girl came at 9:45 to warn us...) but that's the other side of the coin - that it was very well organized and professionally run."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great neighborhood. Close by to everything but quiet at night. Place is as pictured/described.

When we arrived, there was another car in our parking spot. The manager, Amber, was very responsive in helping us find another spot in a building nearby to keep our car in.

Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,The place was very well put together and conveniently located in the heart of town. The outside of the complex is fairly unassuming but is quite charming from within.
,,,,,,,,"The place was great, and very convenient to the convention center.

That said, there could have been more clarity around late checkout procedures.  I didnâ€™t get a chance to look at them the day before (was apparently included in the preliminary instructions), but tried to call in the morning to request a late checkout using the phone numbers I had and left a voicemail and email.  I couldnâ€™t reach anyone and nobody returned my messages.  

When Sandeep did call me, he sounded annoyed and informed me that regardless of the circumstances, we were being charged a late fee.  I understand that they need to schedule cleaning and stuff, but late checkout is extremely common when booking hotels, and we offered to let the cleaning people work even though we were physically still in the unit.  We had already cleaned, packed, and stripped the beds by 10, so there was no reason they couldnâ€™t do what they needed to while we were there.  

Iâ€™m sure moving forward that guests would appreciate a bit more flexibility and cooperation where this is concerned, as I know we would, should we ever decided to book again.
"
,,,,,,,,"Very detailed instructions, good recommendations, overall great experience. 

You have to go through one of the bedrooms to access the only bathroom in the unit.  Just an FYI if using both beds (the second bed is in a loft up the spiral stairs).  

All-in-all, a great find in a great location.  Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Very well located, very clean and pretty! Sandeep was fast to respond to a request that we have, it solved our problem in 1 minute net!"
,,,,,,,,Sandeep was great to deal with as we only stayed one night (having decided that Austin was too good to leave that day!). We booked late in the afternoon and received a reply and check-in instructions within the hour. Great location and nice clean apartment. 
,,,,,,,,"The location of the apartment was fantastic, right downtown and within walking distance of many major attractions.  Everything was clean, well organized, and ready for our arrival.  In addition, getting into the apartment was made very easy through detailed and accurate check-in instructions.
Another bonus was the inclusion of an on-site parking spot.

The apartment in which we stayed was different from that shown in the photographs, but it didn't detract from our stay in any way.

The only thing to note is that the room on the street-side of the apartment allows you to hear just about everything going on below.  ...but you're in the city and shouldn't expect country-quiet nights."
,,,,,,,,"Everything at the property was great! We really enjoyed the location and convenience to area restaurants, bars, and parks."
,,,,,,,,"Information on welcome email and guide was accurate but not detailed enough. When the door dialing box said ""Please Enter"" I expected it to want more information but in fact it wanted me to enter the facility. Small learning curve there. Additionally, the lock on the actual unit works best when the door is pulled snugly outward while typing in the code and allowing the door to unlock. Overall I felt very welcome. The unit was clean and ready for me to stay. The luggage holder was a really nice touch as otherwise my suitcase would have been on the couch!"
,,,,,,,,"From communications through to the condo being exactly as advertised, Sandeep was a perfect host. The location is absolutely perfect â€“ you can walk to any of the well-known entertainment/food areas, historical sites and shopping districts. The bathroom is off one of the bedrooms, so for more than a couple, youâ€™ll have to be OK with that. Otherwise, itâ€™s a perfect spot to stay while youâ€™re in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I donâ€™t write reviews regularly but only on exceptional occasions.

The host Sandeep was very professional from the outset which made booking the apartment an easy process. 

Everything after was as described on the airbnb website. The information brochure provided on booking was informative and accurate which made checking-in and our stay hassle free. The apartment was clean with all the necessary catering, toiletries and laundry equipment provided along with a perfect location for getting around the city.   

Highly recommend you book with this host and enjoy the city of Austin. 
"
,,,,,,,,"The location of the apt is great and made it very convenient to get around. The place was well kept and had a fun open living room.  The beds were very comfortable and the windows throughout the place let in a lot of natural light. 

A few things to consider would be potentially a better TV setup or a guide to help someone new to Austin know what channels etc. 

Also maybe depicting a little better how the loft worked and how it has a fairly low ceiling. 

The only part we found a bit annoying was that the bathroom was only connected from inside one of the bedrooms, so the people in the loft had to come down and go through the other bedroom to get to the bathroom. 

All in all was a fun stay and again a great location. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a pleasant stay at Railyard. We were surprised that we got a different unit, but the new one was a bit bigger so it was all good. Our host was always responsive and eager to tackle any issues we had over our stay. One thing we didn't like was the WiFi connection - I think it was shared by a lot of people so it was on and off most of the time. Other than that great location in downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,He was great. The flat we trÃ­ed to rent was booked so he moved us to a bigger one for the same price. Location and flat simply perfect ! 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exactly as described, and even though i left it until the last minute Sandeep was very quick to accept my booking and get everything sorted out. 
It was really perfect for the convention center and I will certainly stay again. Very clean, very well presented and great value! "
,,,,,,,,Our host Sandeep was prompt and gave very easy and accurate information to make our entrance to the unit very simple. The location to the convention center couldn't be any better. I would stay here again but will book earlier because I really paid for it in the end. Though very nice and safe accommodations. 
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay! Location is perfect!! 
,,,,,,,,Excellent downtown location. Sandeep and Elsa the manager were super helpful and thorough. The apt was clean was stocked with all essentials.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was especially nice. Very clean.  Very convenient 
to the center of Austin and to the convention center. 
Sandeep Nanda was exceptionally accommodating and I would
certainly use one of his apartments in the future. "
,,,,,,,,Overall a good place to stay. Great location. Only issue was the front door needs to be pulled while entering the code and the shower faucet is unusual which took a while to get working. But so long as you know these two things everything else is great. 
4663369,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"We felt like locals! Great parking for us, tons of privacy and an adorable neighborhood. Richard and Sara welcomed our dog-it was so easy to walk to the dog park just a couple blocks away. This has been our favorite airbnb! "
,,,,,,,,This apartment is fantastic. It's so close to downtown and was super quiet. Richard was a great host. I would live here if I could! 
,,,,,,,,"Charming place in a great location.  It was a cute, clean place and the neighborhood is really walkable, which is not easy to find in Austin.  Richard was always quick to respond to any communication."
,,,,,,,,I have stayed here several times and will stay again. Great location and very responsive host. Lots of room compared to others in the area. Close to plenty of restaurants and nightlife.
,,,,,,,,Richard and Sara's house was lovely. 
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay! Everything was a great description of the apt! Richard was very helpful, and a great host! Great location and made us feel a part of Austin! Hope to visit again when it's not raining! "
,,,,,,,,This was a great place to stay for a weekend in Austin!  Richard and Sara were very accommodating - they even brought us extra blankets and some local coffee when the temp outside dropped lower than we expected.  There are several good restaurants/bars/shops in this neighborhood that are a just 5 minute walk away. Definitely recommend this spot and would look to stay here again!  
,,,,,,,,Great place in Charlestown in easy walking distance to town. Cozy historic home with charm. 
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara's home is absolutely stunning. It's in a gorgeous neighborhood, blocks away from great shops and cafes. However, the place itself is spectacular. We fell in love with the place as soon as we stepped foot. 

Richard was beyond helpful and answered all my questions. He made our stay incredible and I look forward to staying here again. "
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at the Green Hill Carriage House! It was a perfect place for my trip. I was visiting Austin for a week, and needed a place for Monday-Thursday. Richard and Sara's place was in a great location for a non-native. I was able to easily walk to a great coffee shop, a grocery store, nice lunch spots, and could quickly get to downtown as well. 

Though I had space at a nearby co-working facility, I ended up working from the carriage house for most of my days, as the setting was peaceful and quiet. 

I would absolutely stay here again. Thanks for everything!"
,,,,,,,,"  Friendly hosts, perfect neighborhood â€“ great Austin experience!   Would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"This is an incredible location, just blocks from Whole Foods and everything West Sixth offers... but also just blocks from the great restaurants in Clarksville.  Richard is easy to communicate with, and really cares about making sure you have all you need for a great visit.  My team used the kitchen table as a meeting workspace during the day, and that worked out well as well!"
,,,,,,,,Loved staying at the Carriage House! It was hard to believe it was in downtown Austin. Very quiet and great location!
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara, were great hosts. The flat was very clean, a good size and in a great location. Only got to meet Richard, who was extremely friendly and accommodating."
,,,,,,,,"It's not available often, but we love to stay here when it is. A stand-alone unit with no neighbors, peaceful oasis just blocks from 6th street. Very responsive host. Will stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent place to stay with our pup! It was very homey and convenient to just about everything in Austin. Richard and Sara are very ""hand-off"" and let you enjoy your stay. They also have an incredible folder filled with answers to any question you may have. We would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Richard was a great host didn't get to meet Sarah.
Loved the relaxed nature of being there. Had other family members in William Green House annex and that all worked very well.
Air con worked well which we were grateful for."
,,,,,,,,"The carriage house is a really cute private space with everything we needed! We loved having kitchen space to fix meals and the little patio deck was a gorgeous spot to sit and have a beer in the sunshine. The place was really clean and comfortable and there were ample towels, toiletries and cleaning supplies which makes things so nice and easy. Richard was quick and easy to communicate with and the area is lovely to walk around- lots of nice places to eat and drink within walking distance and downtown/UT is a quick cab ride or a long walk. Having off-street parking was really handy and would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"My mum, sister and I really enjoyed our stay at the Green Hill Cottage! Richard was incredibly welcoming and helpful - like a neighbour we'd known for years. The house was clean, nicely decorated, and had everything we required. Quiet, green neighbourhood, close to 5th and 6th streets. Beautiful atmosphere all round! "
,,,,,,,,"Richard and.Sarah sent us an email with directions for accessing the house key. Once inside they left us detailed info on the laundry access and places to shop and eat. The apartment is very cute and in a great location. They allowed us to bring our dog and she really appreciated the air conditioning! We had a wonderful time and would highly recommend this air b&b.
"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great.  Arrival & getting keys was easy and self-service.  

Richard and Sara were attentive the couple of times we reached out to them, but also gave us complete privacy otherwise.  Its nice to have the hosts living ""right next door"", but still have ultimate privacy.

The Space itself was adorable and exactly as they described it. The pictures are all accurate."
,,,,,,,,"The host made us feel very welcome, although they were out of town the weekend and we didn't get to meet, they was very clear communication over messaging and we felt welcomed in their home. "
,,,,,,,,"This was an adorable garage apartment in a very cute neighborhood.  Lots of trees, cute houses, and a quiet area in general.  Great neighborhood for taking walks and very close to all the downtown areas.  We enjoyed our stay at the Green Hill Carriage House.  The hosts were very responsive leading up to the rental.  We had no need to contact them with issues during our stay.  It was the perfect place for our little family.  We will definitely keep it in mind for future visits as we frequent Austin regularly.  "
,,,,,,,,"This cottage was perfect for our needs. It is in a quiet, lovely neighborhood close to good restaurants and easy accessible to UT. The rooms are clean and comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed a delightful stay at Green Hill House. The location can't be beat; so close to everything and a wonderful neighborhood to walk. The ""lending library"" was quite active and afforded the chance to meet some neighbors. We would hope to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location for exploring Austin. Super quiet neighbourhood with beautiful houses but just a 10/15 minute walk from all the action. Perfect.

Home itself was clean and exactly as the pictures had represented it. Would recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Loved the apartment and it's very comfortable and clean! It's in a great area of Austin! My friend even slept well on the pullout bed, which can be hard to manage. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others."
,,,,,,,,"We didn't get to meet Richard and Sara, but the carriage house apartment was lovely. It's located on a shaded, secluded alley in a beautiful, walkable neighborhood. The apartment itself has a lot of old-fashioned charm. Do be careful with the vintage doorknobs, as they tend to stick. "
,,,,,,,,We love this little house in Austin. Super chill great location and the hosts are very sweet. 
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Green Hill Carriage House while my daughter attended UT's orientation.  The location is top notch, with many adorable restaurants, shops and coffee shops in easy walking distance.  I found the carriage house to be comfortable and appreciated the convenient location."
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Perfect size for three of us (plus a dog), and fantastic location. Would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent!  Exactly as advertised! Great location in wonderful neighborhood that is convenient (i.e. within walking distance) to shops, dining, and an awesome bookstore!  Easy communication. Richard and Sara were perfect hosts.  Felt very much at home with everything we needed provided. Loved all of the trees/shaded sidewalks in this area. "
,,,,,,,,The accommodations were perfect and spotless. The neighborhood was very beautiful and felt safe. We were able to park off the street and store our bikes safely. The host provided everything we could have possibly needed would 100% stay there again. It was a perfect place to stay. 
,,,,,,,,"This a wonderfully spacious place with tons of charm... We loved the beauty, peace and quiet and loving animals... We will definitely ask to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay just outside downtown Austin. Friendly hosts! Would stay here again!!
,,,,,,,,"The backyard apartment we stayed in was adorable! There's a back alley that gives you easy access to the apartment without disturbing anyone, as well as lots of parking space. We had a great time and the house was only a few blocks from restaurants and shops on W 6th Street. I'd highly recommend staying here if you're looking to stay in a beautiful neighborhood with easy access to downtown!"
,,,,,,,,"The apt. is located in a great neighborhood - quiet, safe and interesting. It has all the basic comforts, plus very nice design & decor.
Close to downtown but feels far away. It was very clean."
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay- Richard and Sara were friendly and welcoming. The location is a beautiful quiet residential neighborhood- one of our favorite parts was looking at the homes and landscaping! Easily walk to pretty much anywhere you want to be, Uber to airport was $20! We (myself, wife and 2 kids) will definitely try to book the Green Hill Carriage House next time we are in Austin!  Thanks Richard and Sara!"
,,,,,,,,"We love this place. Very quiet and private with no neighbors above, below, or next to you. Richard and Sara are very accommodating and responsive. Wonderful setting with nice sitting areas. Close to everything, but not the noise of the city. We stay here whenever there is available space, which is almost never - so if you see some open dates, take them - or we will..."
,,,,,,,,Very beautiful home and accommodating folks. Definitely recommend this cozy home. 
,,,,,,,,"The hosts, Richard and Sara, were excellent:  welcoming, friendly, and helpful.  The listing was entirely accurate.  The location is excellent, as it is on the edge of downtown and within walking distance of plenty of stores, pubs, trails, dog parks, etc.

The apartment layout is great.  Bed is very comfortable.  The separate study is great with a nice view over a nice yard.  Private parking was perfect.  The apartment and situation was well suited for our dog.

I'm sure I'm forgetting things.  All-in-all this is a great place and I'd recommend to anyone and everyone."
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara's place is in a wonderful, walkable neighborhood and they are great hosts. The Carriage House is a perfect locale for work (with a great little sunny study) and relaxation. The house is clean, cozy, and charming and has a comfortable bed and a kitchen that's easy to cook in. Off-street parking was a plus. "
,,,,,,,,"I was so fortunate that they had some open days for me - the place is always booked, and I don't typically know my travel plans to Austin more than a week in advance. If that gives you any indication, it is one of (maybe the) favorite places for me and my wife (and dog) to stay when I come to Austin (which is 2 - 3 weeks per month). It's on my favorite list, and I always watch for it. Location is great, nice deck area to sit on in the evening, and the most responsive host I've run across. If it's available, book it now or it won't be..."
,,,,,,,,"Green Hill Carriage House met our needs very well.  We loved the quiet neighborhood, and the location overall was great for us.  Richard and Sara were helpful, and took time along with their son to visit with my daughter regarding her College visit to UT.  I'm sure we'll be back."
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara's place was lovely! Right in the shadow of downtown, adorable neighborhood, clean/cozy home with some nice touches like coffee/milk. Perfect for a couple or one. Love to stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great first visit to Austin at Sara and Richard's place!  We had 4 people staying here during a friend's wedding weekend.  The house was clean and comfortable, and the location was close to everything we wanted to check out. We loved having a parking spot for our rental car and being able to easily walk many places in this beautiful neighborhood.  Sara and Richard made it easy to communicate with them and are great hosts! "
,,,,,,,,"Our host happens to be an amazing cozy person and very respectfull as well.  Our family had a nice and great experience at Green Hill Carriage House.  A quiet neighborhood and the advantage to have two options to reach the place .   Excelent location. Inside the house all worked just great, comfortable furniture and specially for me that likes to cook, a nice and complete kitchen."
,,,,,,,,The cottage is really cute and full of charm. It's close to downtown but feels more like a small home town neighborhood. Great place for a couple to stay and enjoy the sights in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Was a very easy, enjoyable experience. We were contacted by the hosts via AirBnB several days in advance of the trip with all necessary information for arrival. Unit was clean and comfortable. All expectations were met."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Air BnB experience and it was great! The Carriage House is a quaint, quiet, surprisingly spacious place central to downtown Austin and a stone's throw from some of the best restaurants in the region. But perhaps the best part of this place is Richard and Sara. They are charming and helpful. Whenever I texted either of them, I got a response moments later. I met Richard and spent some time chatting with him, and then got a lovely note from Sara saying she looked forward to meeting me next time. I will absolutely come back next time I'm in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Richard and Sara were great hosts.  My wife and I were in Austin for our wedding and Richard and Sara were very accommodating towards all of our requests.  
,,,,,,,,"This was such a charming place, and perfectly located in Clarksville.  Richard and Sara were wonderful hosts.  We'll be staying again next time we are in Austin (if it is available.)"
,,,,,,,,"Neighborhood was terrific, just what we wanted. They were in contact to make sure we had what we needed, knew where to go. Felt totally supported. House was nicely finished out, cute as a button, and very comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"We never actually met Sara and Richard only because we were so busy with wedding preparations.  We did talk on the phone and Richard made it very clear that he was available if we needed anything.  The house was very sweet, cozy and clean. Because it is an apartment above the garage, you feel a bit like being in a tree house. Small, but just right for our needs. The neighborhood was quiet and well established but again, because of wedding obligations, we did not get to enjoy it as much as we had hoped. Great area for walking. Central location and convenient.  Would definitely recommend as a pleasant stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I just wish this place was available more often. I come to Austin 2 to 3 weeks each month and always use airbnb. This place is so quaint and quiet, and the hosts more than responsive. It's an apartment on top of a garage behind a historical building - no neighbors and a $4.00 UBER ride to my favorite spot on 6th street. Too bad they are not available next week or I'd certainly be back."
,,,,,,,,Sara and Richard were very easy to communicate with. The location was perfect for a weekend trip with friends! 
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time. Great hosts, very friendly, And the place was nice as well."
,,,,,,,,"The carriage house was exactly as advertised. Clean, orderly and very easy to have as a home base.  I highly recommend for anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I arrived in the evening, so it was dark in the alley that we were supposed to enter the house from. The owner did not indicate that the front door we were supposed to enter from was upstairs (or that we were staying in the guest house and not the adorable house in the pictures). No lights were left on, so it was kind of a scary experience. Also, there were cats everywhere, my friend is allergic and we had not been informed of this in advance. This home was cozy, but the photos were a little deceiving as the house was much smaller than it appeared in pictures. The occasion for the weekend was a girls reunion, and the house only had one 11X13 mirror in the bathroom-- talk about a tragedy! However, on the positive side, the king sized bed was very comfy and comfortably slept 4 girls, and it was extremely clean. Overall location was great also!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Sara's Green Hill carriage house bc I needed to get away by myself for a few days. I haven't explored Austin much but I knew that I wanted to stay in that neighborhood. I loved the pedestrian neighborhood, proximity to whole foods & running trails. 
when I travel I love to cook for myself rather than go to restaurants. in my busy real life I don't get to cook for fun. And having access to a gas stove again was a treat! I splurged on groceries at whole foods & made yummy meals for myself. The kitchen has basics as far as cookware & tools, but just enough for me to cook at a pretty high level. 
I also was attracted to the property for the wood floors... so I could do yoga... and the study that is off the bedroom: The natural light was lovely & it was such a serene environment to write in my journal & do some work I brought w me. 
some highlights: the bed is huge & comfy. The water pressure in the shower was fantastic!! the little apt is in a little grove of trees & bamboo, so even in the punishing heat of July, it was so cool inside the apt without having to crank up the ac very much. 
I didn't watch the TV or avail myself of the washer & dryer, but it's nice to know they're there. the Internet worked flawlessly... once I figured out that the password is case-sensitive. 
Sara was very accommodating to me, bringing a blender that I asked for bc I'm addicted to protein shakes. 
my trip was far too short & I was sad to have to leave. I'd love to find a way to return."
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay. Awesome location. And the air-con was fantastic!
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful location, great apt, and spot-on communication. We will return!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was exactly as described. It was well furnished and had everything we needed for our short stay in Austin. A+
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I hope they are all like this. Great location - walked almost everywhere - $5 worth of Uber gets you just about anywhere downtown you need to go. Beautiful neighborhood, gracious hosts whom I never actually met (though my wife met Richard). My only issue is that the location isn't available again until June!"
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara were great hosts! Very responsive and welcoming. The Green Hill Carriage House is in a quiet, tree lined neighborhood with other beautiful homes nearby. We enjoyed the privacy and the proximity to several cafes for brunch, downtown Austin, and to the running trails along the river. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Sara and Richard were great hosts available to answer questions or provide assistance but gave us plenty of space. The carriage house was really great, set in a lovely garden in a very nice neighbourhood, a relaxing peaceful space after busy days out. The beds comfortable with lovely quality sheets.

If I were to visit Austin again I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! 

"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at the Green Hill Carriage House. The hosts took care to make sure we had what we needed...like hangers for example..Yet stayed out of our business unless needed.  I.The place is sweet and clean. The neighborhood is lovely  and delightful to walk . We liked the location across town from the scene-scenes in Austin and retreat to this lovely space for quietude...regroup and head out again...perfect!   Our 14 year old daughter  enjoyed the space ,too. "
,,,,,,,,"We first stayed at the Green Hill Carriage House for a whole summer six years ago. We loved it so much we included a stay in our holiday itinerary this time around! Sara and Richard are excellent hosts - very friendly and accommodating, and extremely flexible in terms of check-in/ out times. The house itself is fantastic - separate from the main house but close enough if you need anything. The location is also amazing - right in the heart of Clarkesville and 8 mins walk from Lamar/ West 6th (Whole Foods Market, Waterloo Records, BookPeople etc). We will definitely be returning! "
,,,,,,,,"Great place! Very well accommodated, comfortable one bedroom with office. Perfect solution for a business travel or couple that wants a bit more than a standard hotel. $10 uber to downtown. "
,,,,,,,,"The carriage house is so wonderful. Perfectly located close to downtown but tucked away in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. The most comfortable bed ever invented, a cute little deck for morning coffee, exceptionally clean and well appointed. My friends and I had a fabulous weekend here and look forward to returning in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"The Green Hill Carriage house was perfect. Sara was welcoming and very accommodating. We traveled with our dog and the convince of a dog park close by was great. Very pet friendly.  Cute, comfortable, and close to everything!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at the Green Hill Carriage House was fantastic. Sara and Richard were great hosts; very accommodating at the start and then left us with plenty of privacy. The space was clean and really cozy, even with the cold weather outside. 
The local area was very good. Quiet in the immediate neighbourhood with just a few minutes walk to groceries, lovely restaurants, and good bars. 
Can't say enough good things about the apartment and hosts. Well worth staying here, I would do it again!"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience at the green hill carriage house is hard to put to words. It was perfect in every way, shape and form. It was exactly what me and my friends were looking for. The location was perfect. The bedding worked out perfectly. The scenic green garden and fire place area was the cherry on top.

Sara and her husband were beyond amazing. Sara had stopped at every opportunity to help the whole ordeal. 

We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and even better host too!

10/10 loved it! "
11342585,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Dana's place was very sufficient - we did have issues with water not draining in the tub which made taking a shower pretty gross.  She was very responsive. Place is fair for the price.
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place to stay.  Great location and Dana is an impeccable host.  Communicates well, is prepared and answers any questions promptly.  Could not ask for more!! "
,,,,,,,,"Dana's place was great for my short trip to Austin. Great location, cute space, and Dana made check in easy with text instructions the day before. Would absolutely stay there again"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great with our stay at Dana's apartment. Dana was quick to respond to our questions, check in and check out was a breeze, and the condo was very clean and neat! The location is great and we were very happy that we were within walking distance of shops, bars and restaurants of the SoCo area. We look forward to our next visit to Austin and will definitively want to stay at her condo again!"
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay here. No friction and the apartment was cozy and inviting. 
,,,,,,,,We were very welcomed. Clear directions and easy to find and access
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying at Dana's condo!! It was walking distance from SoCo and tons of stuff to do. She always responded very quickly and gave us a list of recommendations. When we come back to Austin, we will surely try to book Dana's Condo!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was fantastic. It was clean and comfortable, had lovely decor and a comfortable bed. 
If I visited Austin again I would still stay near South Congress ave, there's so much to do and it's easy to get to the rest of the city. We didn't get to meet Dana, but she left us everything we needed. Thanks! "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exactly as described, in a beautiful neighborhood in walking distance to the great shops and restaurants on South Congress. Dana also provided very helpful information before check-in."
,,,,,,,,Good location within walking distance of all the shops and restaurants on S. Congress! Dana was super helpful and easy to communicate with before and during our stay.
,,,,,,,,"Dana is a great host! Communication prior to arrival was excellent and she provided insider information about Austin that made our visit run smooth. Getting checked into the condo was a breeze, as was departing. The condo is also in the perfect location to explore both the SoCo and 6th Street areas of Austin for great food & music. The condo is cute and clean and was a much better deal for us than staying at the hotels nearby. "
,,,,,,,,"Location is great, the unit is well-furnished and very clean, and Dana was super helpful!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at Dana's place- the location was perfect and it had everything we needed. 
,,,,,,,,Great location for discovering SoCo. Would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Dana was a great host, loved the location."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was accurately described and everything worked well. It was well located for everything in Austin. 
Having never been to the city before, it took us a little while to realise how close everything was. Perhaps a little more on how to get to places rather than just listing them would have helped. That said every query we had was answered immediately.
Very pleased with our visit to Austin and with Dana's apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Dana's place is great, exactly how it's in the pictures.  The neighborhood is awesome and it's location to SOCO is great. Would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,Dana was great. We were able to drop off our luggage before check in so we could go explore. She gave us lots of information about places to go. The apartment is adorable and a perfect location. 
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. Dana's communication was perfect and she was very respectful of my space and privacy!
,,,,,,,,"Before we arrived, Dana was really communicative. It was really easy to access the apartment, which was clean and spacious. 

Dana was really helpful as a host and the apartment was in a great spot. I'd definitely stay here again if in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,Really cool neighborhood! Walking distance to south congress. Never been to austin before and this place provided a good jumping off point to a lot of adventures; would definitively stay again
,,,,,,,,"Dana was very responsive. The property is in a beautiful neighborhood. Fun to walk around and see the area.  The unit had plenty of space for two of us.  Furnishings are great. Overall, great place for a quick trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great condo! Walking distance to shops, restaurants, even the Bats of Austin that we stumbled upon. Very cool place and we would stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,Dana's condo was exceptional living space for two people for the price and the location. We were able to walk to local shops and restaurants and it was a quick ride to other places in the city.
,,,,,,,,"Dana is a wonderful host and her apartment is super cute! Perfect location to explore Austin by foot, bike or car. Space is beautifully decorated, clean, cozy and ideal for a extended getaway. Dana promptly responded to any and every question we had and made the stay super smooth and easy (not to mention gave us the scoop on some delicious restaurants!) and worked to ensure our comfort and happiness throughout our stay. Highly recommend renting through Dana and grabbing this particular apartment while you can!"
,,,,,,,,"Dana's place is very well situated and we really appreciated our stay there. She's answering really fast you question, it was perfect"
,,,,,,,,Cute place. Super cozy. Great location. Lovely host. 
,,,,,,,,Dana was great and the place was just as described :)
,,,,,,,,Dana was very responsive. She provided detail instructions on accessing the place and how to get around. The place was very clean and the neighborhood is quiet. It is not too far away from the city. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Austin. I had a great experience. 
,,,,,,,,"Dana's apartment is in the best area, so close to South Congress and all the shops and restaurants but in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The apartment was cozy and Dana was so easy to communicate with. "
,,,,,,,,"Wow!  This totally exceeded our expectations!  Dana anticipated all our possible needs and communicated with us effectively.  

The condo is walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and nightlife.  I would definitely recommend to friends and family who are visiting Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,Great place and great location!  
,,,,,,,,We had a very nice stay. The location is great. Dana's response time is quite efficient even after our stay. (I thought I'd left something behind) We would definitely come back again when in the area.
,,,,,,,,"Dana was a good host. She was always there when we had problems and responded quickly either by email or text. (WE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS) The neighborhood was nice and quiet.

One of the problems we encounter was, 
1. When we were getting ready for bed, we noticed there was hair all over the bed and blood stains on the bed sheets!! SO GROSS!! Dana was able to provide us with new sheets the next day, but it was an instant nightmare and we had mentally checked out of this living space within hours!! Nobody should ever have to experience that!! 

2. The next day, we couldn't use the restroom as the ceiling was leaking water. So you couldn't use the restroom unless you wanted dirty water splashing on you!! Dana said she would try and get someone over there to repair it, but they never came!! She also said she had passed this on to the next set of people that were coming to stay at her place?? Who would enjoy that??

3. Yes, there is a TV, but you better have Netflix, HBO GO, or some other type of app so you can stream TV. If you don't have any of these apps, you wont be watching TV. 

We will never do another Airbnb again!! The only great thing about this entire situation, I got my money back for two nights!! Terrible experience and awful living spot!! I recommend anybody wanting a stress free, clean, living area.....GET A HOTEL!! $10 more and you can get a nice hotel without any of these problems!!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay. Dana's place was wonderful, close to a lot of fun restaurants, bars, and other Austin attractions. Dana also made it so easy and simple to check in and make our stay as comfortable as possible (down to suggesting alternatives to Lyft and Uber). "
,,,,,,,,"Dana's place was great, very comfortable  . Such a good central location as well. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was great. Place was very tidy and from check-in to check-out, we never saw anyone.
"
,,,,,,,,"What a cute place! Dana's communication with us before our arrival was thorough and very helpful. A super clean, quiet place just blocks away from Busy, Ultra Cool South Congress. It was wonderful not worrying about parking, too.  Thanks, Dana!"
,,,,,,,,"Thanks for the great place, Dana. Had everything we needed. Location, air conditioning, comfortable design and a great bed. Again, the location was perfect, enabling us to get everywhere we wanted to go within a ten minute radius. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location and neighborhood. Lots of room   Super comfy bed. We had a great time 

Would go back for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was beautiful and cozy and the neighborhood was fantastic! 
Very fun stay in SoCo :)"
,,,,,,,,"My trip was great, and Dana was a tremendous host.  The condo was the perfect place for a weekend getaway!  It's located walking distance from great shops and resteraunt's and Dana does a great job of making sure that your taken care of.  I would definitely recommend Dana's condo."
,,,,,,,,Great location for my stay as it was close to my work functions and easy to get around the city as well.  The condo had everything I needed.  Dana made it very easy to get in and settled.   I'd definitely consider staying again if I'm around Austin.  
,,,,,,,,"Dana's flat is awesome! My only regret is that I couldn't spent more than one night. It's really nicely decorated and immaculately clean, and the location is really convenient to SoCo and downtown. Plus Dana went out of her way to accommodate and early check-in time, which made my day. I will definitely be back."
,,,,,,,,Comfortable and convenient- stay here! 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was beautiful and spotless, and had everything you need for an awesome Austin stay (including facewash! Very exciting). The location is awesome (5ish min to a B-cycle stop as well as lots of places to eat and drink). Highly recommend a stay here!"
,,,,,,,,I loved this apartment!  Very close to South College and uptown.  Loved the pool and the quiet courtyard.  Felt like I lived in Austin for a little bit.
,,,,,,,,"Instructions were very easy. The place was nice, clean, and close to interesting places and where I needed to be. Good place to stay to see Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful space, easy communication, and just fantastic all around. "
,,,,,,,,"Dana's place was very cozy and convenient.  It had pretty much every amenity we needed for a short stay, was close to South Congress, and Dana was very responsive when we had questions.  The decor was also tastefully done and made us feel right at home."
,,,,,,,,"Very easy, pleasant, well-located condo. A short walk to SoCo."
,,,,,,,,"Dana was an awesome host. Everything was as described, and we enjoyed being able to rest and relax in her clean and comfortable home during our vacation. It worked really well for us (2 adults + 1 baby), in terms of location (close proximity to SoCo, downtown, and a short drive to UT) and size (though we are used to smaller living spaces). 

We are especially grateful that she was so easy to reach and work with when the unexpected happened: the ceiling in the bathroom began to leak (as a result of the upstairs neighbors running their dishwasher). Even though she wasn't in town at the time, Dana responded immediately and made sure the leak was dealt with ASAP. Throughout the process, it was clear that she wanted to make sure we were okay, whether that meant us finding another place to stay (with the help of Airbnb) or choosing to continue staying in her apartment (with the leak stopped). We would definitely recommend Dana as a host! "
,,,,,,,,"Location, location, location! I've been to Austin many times and this is by far the best location to stay. We walked to all the shops on SoCo and could've went the other way into downtown if we wanted to. Awesome! The apartment is beautiful and provided more than enough space for us. Dana is extremely responsive before, during and after the stay."
,,,,,,,,"Dana was a great host and very helpful. We rode our bikes everywhere, so the apartment was in a great location for us. It was very clean and stocked with all the necessities. Overall it was a great experience in Austin and could not have asked for better place to stay or a more comunicative host. "
,,,,,,,,Dana has a lovely place and was incredibly helpful in making our stay great! The unit has everything you would need and couldn't be in a better location relative to everything along south congress and downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect AirBnB experience! Thanks, Dana!"
,,,,,,,,"Cute, clean, and quaint apartment in South Austin. Dana was great and gave me recommendations of cool restaurants nearby. Super comfy bed! Good for 1-2 people. "
,,,,,,,,"Although Dana and I never actually met, she was a great host and kept in touch throughout my stay.  The property is basic, but perfect for what I needed and well-located to the South of the city. "
,,,,,,,,"What can I say?! From the moment we made the request for the booking it was easy! Dana replied quickly and although we didn't get to meet her she was with us all the way through our stay. We were given simple and easy instructions for arrival and each step of our stay. After 4 weeks on the road we enquired about laundry and Dana was quick to respond and direct us to the laundry in the building as well as the detergent in the cupboard - so great, thank you! The location was great - only a 10 min walk to South Congress and we hung out there and felt like we were at home. At great stay - thank you so much!"
,,,,,,,,"Dana's apartment was very clean and cozy. Located walking distance to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping and transportation, there was always somewhere to go. Checking in and out was as easy as it gets, and communication was quick and easy. We really enjoyed our trip to Austin, I would  definitely stay at Dana's again. "
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was beautifully minimalistic, clean, refreshing and radiating with positive energy. Neighborhood was quite, yet close to all the action. Comfortable bed, cozy bathroom. Dana was a wonderful host, communication was easy and instructions up to the point. All in all, I enjoyed my short stay here and would definitely recommend."
15267236,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"My friend and I really enjoyed our stay at Tamina's place! It was clean, cozy and we loved hanging out with the playful, adorable kitties. Tamina was very helpful in arranging our arrival even though it was late. She and her roommate allowed us our privacy and rarely saw them come in or out of the apartment, but they were so nice and welcoming when we did cross paths. There was a thoughtfully compiled book of tips and suggestions for the area left in the room, which was appreciated. The location was an excellent base for exploring Austin, with plenty of good bars and restaurants in walking distance. I'd definitely recommend anyone stay a their place, especially any cat lovers!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay here. The apartment is clean, has plenty of space for a couple, is in a great location and has three adorable little cats! The cats are very friendly and lots of fun. We would love to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed staying in the room, it was nice and clean.  Everything was very clear and lots of sticky notes showing where everything is.  The apartment is in a really nice area next to lot of cool bars and right next to the river with a great walking path.  We enjoyed our stay."
,,,,,,,,"Very friendly and accommodating hosts with an *impeccably* clean, inviting space resulted in a wonderful vacation in Austin! The neighborhood was quiet (in a good way) and is perfectly located next to tons of cool little places/food trucks. It was so nice being just a short walk away from downtown Austin. Also, the cats are SO cute and friendly!! "
,,,,,,,,"Stayed here for 3 nights with a friend. Our hosts were very welcoming and helpful during our stay. They recommended a lot of options and places to eat that were walking distance to the airbnb. The location was less than 10 minute walk from Zilker Park, the Colorado River and Barton Creek. Their 3 pet cats were adorable and welcomed us every time we arrived. I would only recommend staying here if you enjoy the company of cats. 

"
15206876,4.5,9,10,10,10,9,9,Good location. Nice little room in a great Austin neighborhood. 
,,,,,,,,John is a thoughtful and gracious host. The neighborhood is beautiful and very walkable -- my favorite neighborhood in Austin.  Public transit nearby. Exceptional value. I'll definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is located in a lovely neighborhood and has a really nice vibe. John is an excellent host, precise and careful in giving assistance and instructions."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and John was nice. Description is accurate, best for certain types of guests."
,,,,,,,,"John is a great host, was there to meet us and coordinated with us before we arrived.  He kept in contact with us to ask if we need anything.  Nice home, close to downtown so it's easy to walk to any amenities.  "
,,,,,,,,"Staying with John was a fantastic experience. He knew a lot of great places to check out while in Austin and his home was super charming and comfortable. It's also in a great location, with a lot of places to check out that are walking distance. Would definitely look into his place first if I ever find myself going back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,I very much enjoyed my stay with John. The building is on the older side (not uncommon for this neighborhood of Austin) but the apartment was very clean. John is a great person and a terrific host and he did everything he could to make sure that I had a comfortable stay. I would  highly recommend him and would stay again!
5617119,,9,10,10,10,10,10,"Cara was very accommodating in meeting to drop off the key to her place. Her apartment is in an excellent location in close proximity to all that ATX has to offer. You will find her apartment very neatly organized, clean, and ready to host your small group."
,,,,,,,,"I was fortunate to book with Cara after a last minute cancellation by another host, the night before I was traveling for SXSW. Cara was so gracious and helpful at such a stressful time! Her place was absolutely perfect, super close to downtown...a 15 minute walk to the convention center and a short walk to the South Congress area. Her place was clean, quiet and comfortable... right on the trail along the river. And Cara was available for any questions or concerns. Thanks for everything, Cara!!"

Anais is great with communication and making sure you're having an enjoyable stay. The rooftop pool and workout facilities look awesome.

,,,,,,,,Anais's place is awesome. I would totally stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Anais's apartment is in a fantastic location on Rainey Street adjacent to a strip of bars and restaurants.  The apartment is an easy half mile walk to downtown and Dirty 6th, and 1-2 mile walk to East Sixth.  The apartment is a nice sized modern clean studio in a secure building.  If you are seeking to explore Austin on foot this apartment is perfect!"
,,,,,,,,"Anais has a charming, clean, and genuinely great apartment.  The location couldn't be better.  Anais was very responsive and made sure everything was taken care of throughout my stay.  Overall great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location in Austin, will stay here again.  Great communication, clean and convenient."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Right in front of all the action.  Great communication before and during our stay. I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,My husband and I had so much fun. It's a modern building in a perfect location just close to very nice and trendy bars and restaurants. We really recommend this place. :)
,,,,,,,,"Anias did a great job about communicating with us before and during our stay. We never had any problems and the location was right by the action on Rainey street. The pictures are very accurate of the apartment and we felt very safe there. Overall, we would recommend it! "
,,,,,,,,Location was perfect for my husband and I. Rainey street has so much to offer from food trucks to bars and access to the river walk. Communication with the host was absolutely fantastic - responses took minutes and everything was coordinated perfectly. Not one complaint! Great spot - easy to get around the city on foot and in car! :) 
,,,,,,,,Anais' place was perfect and exactly what we were looking for for our night in Austin. Clean and very new. Great amenities and can't beat the location. Anais was also a great host and very communicative. Check in and check out was also very detailed and easy. 
,,,,,,,,"My experience was amazing! I had never been to Austin before, and Anais made sure that everything was set up perfectly at the place. Location is right on Rainey and walking distance from 6th. The complex where the apartment is located is brand new, and has many anemities that are impossible not to appreciate. I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect during my stay at Anais's apartment- the location is awesome, right on Rainey St next to lots of bars and restaurants and near downtown, the apartment was super clean and had everything you would need, and Anais was really responsive. Highly recommend!   "
,,,,,,,,"The check-in process was easy. The unit was spotless. The location is great. Despite the nightlife going on just across the street from the building, the we didn't hear a thing inside our unit."
,,,,,,,,"I'm  right in the middle of everything I want from Rainey St, and it is still separate so I can chill.  I did a workout in the gym, definite plus.  Bring mg a bathing suit and plan extra time to hang out.
"
,,,,,,,,"everything went so smoothly. place is beautiful, very clean. access to very nice gym and rooftop pool was wonderful. even closer to sixth st than advertised. very good experience overall, would def stay again!"

Her place is in a great location on the pretty and lively Rainey Street (full of bars and eateries) and near the gorgeous lake. It's nice and quiet inside the studio which is a clean, bright and modern space.  The roof top pool was a lovely bonus aswell and we took advantage of the garage parking too which was really handy."
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect weekend getaway! We were in town for ACL and had a lovely stay for 3. Short walk to downtown and many bars, restaurants, coffee shops. She was very sweet, helpful, and timely response to questions. We will definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Don't let the lack of pictures deter you! This is a great location for the price. The apartment was easy to access, Anais offered parking options and clear instructions into her apartment. The space was a small updated studio with a great view! Everything we could need was provided and Anais was always available for questions. The location is literally walking distance from Downtown. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone/couple planning a stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"One of the best locations in Austin and a clean, comfortable apartment. Check in was simple and Anais was in regular contact in the lead up to make sure there was no confusion. Great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Booked this at the last minute, Anais was awesome. Easy in, easy out. The condo is super clean, comfortable and in a spectacular location at the beginning of Rainey Street adjacent to all the bars and restaurants. I will definitely book this condo again if available. "
,,,,,,,,"This spot is a perfect location to everything Austin! Located right in the heart of Rainey Historical district where the best bars and food trucks in town are located. If your looking to head up to 6th street it's only a 10 min walk, between a mile and a half and a mile walk, very easy to do! The visitor center is a stroll away in case you need a break from the bar scene.

The room is a perfect size, bigger than a hotel room and a lot more amenities than a hotel! Bed was super comfortable and  access to the building is very easy with the keypad locks. 

I would absolutely recommend this place! The host is very attentive to your needs and responds immediately. We had a really great time!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great location just a mile from downtown, and literally out the door from one of the coolest neighborhoods in Austin. Anais was VERY responsive with any communications, and checkin/checkout was a breeze.

The spot was perfectly clean, and absolutely safe. I would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,We were in Austin for a convention this past weekend.  Any questions I had were definitely answered in a timely manner. The location was great for walking to the convention center. In the evening if you wanted  a bite to eat the food trucks and night life was right outside your door step. The building is very secure and felt safe with the security guards. I would definitely rent this place again. 
,,,,,,,,"Love that place! Very cool location with a few places to go out directly in front of the building. Very modern, nice and clean. All perfect"
,,,,,,,,The place was awesome for 2 people and the location was perfect. There were several bars right outside and 6th Street was just a short walk away.  Would definitely come back again for our next trip to austin.
,,,,,,,,"Great host. Very nice space with a nice view of the sunrise. The space was very modern, clean, and simple . Had all the things to make it a comfortable stay. Great location for a fun night out and accessible to other cool spots. "
,,,,,,,,Anais' place is ideally situated in a popular part of downtown Austin. Had no problems checking in late and the accommodations were perfect. If you are planning a stay in Austin this is the place to be. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Nice and clean apartment, pretty much brand new. Anais was prompt with questions and helpful."
,,,,,,,,"First time using Airbnb, had a hiccup getting a parking permit for the garage but ultimately i found parking on the street. Otherwise had a pleasant experience."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location, comfy bed and super clean, loved staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is beautiful and modern and in a perfect location close to everything one would want in Austin. Host was very responsive and quick to tend to questions and concerns via email. Since this is a newly built apartment complex there were a few kinks to be worked out in the building, specifically the very weak water pressure in the shower. However, the host acknowledged our concern and promised to get the plumbing issue addressed. We enjoyed our stay. "
,,,,,,,,Our stay on Rainey street was lovely! You really cannot ask for a better location.Everything you could need is right out the door and it was only a 15 minute walk to 6th and very close to downtown. 
,,,,,,,,"If there is a better location in Austin i am not sure we're it is place was great ! Clean, easy check in and just really wonderful place ! Staying there every time I visiting Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Clean and luxurious.  Anais very responsive to questions.  Property located in a great neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Anais was a great host! The location was perfect, we were able to walk downtown and get around very easily. Building was very nice. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and great complex. 
,,,,,,,,"10/10! Everything this weekend went great and that started with a clean room in a perfect location for adventures. The building has many accommodations, parking instructions were very clear before check in, and Anais was very helpful with directions for checking in and checking out. Would stay here again in a heartbeat! "
,,,,,,,,Me and the girlfriend enjoyed the place. The location was key for us to get in and out of Austin with minimal traffic. Everything we did was either a 15 minute walk or drive. The condo was nice and clean just like the pictures. Both the host and assistance was fast and responding to messages. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was great, clean, and perfectly located.  only think that would have improved our stay is more kitchen/cook ware plates, bowls, etc and a blender :-) limited kitchen.  other than that is was absolutely perfect.  Oh and you can even catch the bats take flight each night at sunset from the balcony! "
,,,,,,,,We had a great time at this apartment! The view is incredible and you can see the famous bats from the balcony. The location on Rainey street is PERFECT. We loved being able to walk to great food and bars. I recommend the Indian restaurant on Rainey and a night at blackheart or Lustre Pearl. My husband LOVED the gym and I loved the roof top pool! Anais is very responsive and helpful with any questions you have. Will look to book this place again next time we are in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful view and great location!  Right on Rainey street near all night life this street offers.  And it's walkable to the 6th street bar area (about 15 minute walk).  Also close to the trails along the lake/river with a city bike rental nearby.  We had 3 girls staying in the apartment, 2 in the queen size bed and 1 on the couch.  From previous reviews we knew there were not any extra blankets so we brought an extra blanket for the person on that couch and that worked just fine for us.  It is only a studio size apartment but for a weekend stay it was great!  The view overlooks the river and the city and faces congress bridge so we could see the bats leaving the bridge at sunset (apparently one of the top things to see in Austin). 
The pool area is great and there is also a very nice rooftop deck to hang out on.  There is also a small gym available for guests.  There is a small grocery store on the same block so convenient for snacks and drinks to bring back to the apartment.  Anais responded quickly to any questions and checkin/checkout was very simple."
,,,,,,,,Anais was a great host.  We had to delay our arrival for a couple of goes but checkin was a breeze and everything was extremely easy.  The apartment was great.  It had a great view and amazing furnishings.  The location was downright amazing most things were walking distance or a short drive away.  I would strongly recommend staying at Anais's place to anyone.
,,,,,,,,Beautiful view
,,,,,,,,By far the best place I've stayed while Austin. The view was absolutely amazing. Right on Rainey St so no need to get a cab for a night out. Anais was very helpful and responsive despite my late arrival. I won't hesitate to book if this place is available next time I visit.
,,,,,,,,"Luxury Apartment, clean and well maintained, great view, very close to downtown and Convention center. I find everything same as mentioned. Anais is very responsive to my text, she usually reply back within couple of minutes. Only problem I had was with very slow Wi-Fi, for that as per her text, she will schedule maintenance. Perfect place for two persons. "
,,,,,,,,Great location! Close to excellent restaurants and bars. The view is amazing and makes the balcony pleasant to sit out on.  Couldn't have asked for a better place for the price.  
,,,,,,,," Great host. Amazing location and the views can't be done justice with the photos. It's so much better. And Rainey Street area is packed with places to eat, drink and be merry.

Anais made my stay very trouble-free. Responsive to questions and quick to offer help. Also, when there was a tricky situation at the very end of the stay she was very sensible in her response. I would highly recommend a stay in this amazing spot."
,,,,,,,,"Address is incorrect on the listing, but Anais sent it to me along with the code and apartment number. She responded very quickly as I had questions about where to park,etc. View is great, the apartment complex is a luxury high rise and in a great neighborhood. I came here with my two girlfriends (3 ppl total) for Sunday funday and paddle boarding on the lake.
Only thing is that there aren't two beds. There is one queen size bed and a couch. We had to ask for sheets for the couch, but we never received a blanket for the girl that had to sleep on the couch. Also, there's a tv, but no cable box or Apple TV, so if you want to watch a game you'd have to go to the common areas. View and location were great but the sleeping situation isn't ideal for 3 people"
,,,,,,,,"Anais was great! She was responsive and helpful. The condo is in a great location with a great view. Close to all of the restaurants and bars, but far enough to enjoy the peace and quiet."
,,,,,,,,"I booked this place at the last minute without really looking at the details. When I arrived, I discovered it was a rather upscale complex with a balcony view overlooking the city. There's also a rooftop pool and lounge area! Anais is amazing! He was very accommodating and clear with instructions. I had a few questions when I got there and he answered them almost immediately. This was my first Airbnb and it definitely left a great first impression! Overall, the studio was very nice and super clean, it also had everything you needed from tooth paste, towels, kitchenware, and even a projector that used the wall as a screen!! This place is also prime location! It's literally 5 minutes from everything and the street itself has tons of cool hipster bars. Would definitely book this place again "
,,,,,,,,"Location location location, you will not find a better place for work and play.  Rainey is my favorite hot spot in Austin. What an jaw dropping view of the river and downtown Austin. The studio was clean.  I really enjoyed the pool on the roof overlooking the city.  Walking distance to multiple jog/bike trails along the river. Key fob gives access to all amenities and elevator. Remember to take it with you everywhere. The access code will get you also work.  You will need the access code to get into the building at first."
15583716,5,10,10,10,10,9,10,"Aaron was very easy to contact and the place is very spacious, well equipped and great location!"
,,,,,,,,"Such a great stay! Beautiful apartment and awesome location. Prompt response when we had fob issues, would definitely stay again. Thanks Aaron!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, new building, good fitness area. Right in the middle of the Rainey district in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Aaron was awesome!   He was thorough in explaining his unit and building.   The unit was stunningly clean and comfortable.  It was like staying in an upscale, modern hotel. The building is absolutely beautiful and in an amazing location.  Rainey St is a hidden gem, and comfortable walking distance from 6th street.  He was very helpful and accommodating with local transit options.   I will stay here when I am back in Austin, no doubt!"
458217,4.5,9,10,9,10,10,9,Great older budget accommodations at a great price and in a wonderful part of Austin.  I made a last minute reservation and Tyler quickly accommodated me.  
,,,,,,,,Great little get away! Easy and smooth trip from booking to checkout. Also the location is unbeatable. 
,,,,,,,,"Really cool spot! Nothing beats relaxing on the porch of this little house when the weather's nice, communing with the Austin skyline. And it is just far enough away from all the craziness but you can still head out on foot and be downtown in no time. 24 Diner and Waterloo Records are really close by. I had an excellent stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, Tyler is a great host and answered all of my touristy questions"
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's detached house was a great place for our very short stay in Austin. Would be lovely to stay longer, as it was a relaxing and cosy spot, short distance away from downtown and all it has to offer. Tyler communicated everything we needed to know once booking was confirmed, ensuring smooth arrival. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was as advertised. Wonderful location. I really enjoyed my stay here.
,,,,,,,,Awesome place great price and close to all the action if you're ok with a little walk - if not a very short cab ride - super great host - easy to work with and has perfect communication and great taste in music 
,,,,,,,,Great location!  We really enjoyed our stay.
,,,,,,,,"The host was very friendly and responded quickly when I needed assistance figuring out how to use the keyless lock for the front door. It is about a 35 minute walk to the convention center, so is convenient."
,,,,,,,,"Basic bungalow had all we needed for a fun weekend in Austin, great location "
,,,,,,,,Everything was great.  The cottage is very charming and private.  Tyler made sure we had everything we needed.  The location is also great.  i would def come back.  
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's place was great! Very centrally located for the things my friends and I wanted to do and we LOVED that it was right next door to graffiti park. The place was just as described and Tyler had every amenity we needed (shampoo, conditioner, towels, toothpaste, etc.). He communicated very well with me and made sure we were comfortable. The bed was incredibly comfortable and there was a couch and air mattress if needed! The only thing I didn't realize until I reserved the place was that the central AC does not work, but there are window units and we were never uncomfortable. Great thanks to Tyler for the awesome stay!!"
,,,,,,,,Tyler was very communicative and his place is in a fun and unique location. The place is a little well-worn and could be a bit cleaner but overall I had a good time there.
,,,,,,,,"The best part about Tyler's place was definitely the location, which is just west of central Austin including UT, sixth street, the capitol building, downtown, etc. (just over a mile walk to each). It's very close to the graffiti walls, which do draw some crowds to the area during the weekend and make street parking more difficult, but not impossible. The unit itself is up a pretty big flight of stairs, which results in a great view of the city skyline, but if you have issues with climbing up and down a bunch of stairs (which we did not) then you might consider that before booking. Since three of us were staying and there's only one bed, Tyler also put out an air mattress for us, including bedding, which worked perfectly well. Otherwise, the place was clean and functional, even if it wasn't the nicest place I've ever stayed in. Being an old-looking separate unit up on the side of a hill, the deck and the house creaked and swayed just a little, and the bathroom floor had some soft spots and a clawfoot tub. But overall for the cost it was a decent spot in a great location, and Tyler was helpful and made himself available if we had any questions or needed anything. I would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"A very private retreat with a great skyline view of the city. House was fine and accommodated the 3 of us well.  Only downside, the hike up the hill of stairs to get from the street to the bungalow. There also isn't adequate lighting and I hit my head on an overhang of another house on property while traversing the steep steps.
Other than that, a decent place to stay for a weekend of living like an Austin local. "
,,,,,,,,"AMAZING music selection in this unique, lovely little spot. 

"
,,,,,,,,This one bedroom apartment bungalow was perfect for me and my three friends. Such a great experience. 
,,,,,,,,"Easy to find, right next door to the graffiti park, as described. Tyler responded quickly to all of our questions. Nothing fancy by any means, but we had a great time! Thanks Tyler! "
,,,,,,,,Love this place! Perfect quite little retreat right in the heart of ATX. We frequent Austin monthly usually with BnB's and Tylers place was one of the best we have been in so far. Great location and price. Tyler saved the day(night) with a wine key for a friend and I and was personable and easy to contact.  
,,,,,,,,"Great home, great location, great host, and a great time! "
,,,,,,,,Yay
,,,,,,,,"Loved this house! Great views of the city, literally next door to the graffiti wall! Location is ideal if you want to be close to the city. Overall Wonderful place to stay and would recommend it to anyone"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, and everything you need to stay in Austin. A lot of privacy as well. Parking wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  "
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was very good at communicating and also allowed us to drop off our stuff early before we went out to explore the city. Apartment was easy to access, with a combination lock that made it nice and easy to not have to coordinate picking up keys. 

Unfortunately the place was less than I'd expected for $150/night. The A/C worked but it was an old unit and sounded like a lawnmower every time it turned on which woke me up every time it turned on. The place felt like grungy college house: A lot of cobwebs, a stained shower (that was really just an old bathtub with two mildewed shower curtains surrounding it), towels that smelled musty, and broken blinds that let in a ton of sun. In the bathroom there was a tablecloth nailed to wall instead of a frosted window or mini-blinds. 

I wasn't expecting this to be a fancy hotel, but for $150/night, I was hoping for just a nice, clean, quiet place to stay. This failed to meet my expectations. "
,,,,,,,,Tyler did everything to make our stay smooth and comfortable. We definitely enjoyed the place and its proximity to most of Austin's attractions. I definitely recommend for anyone trying to explore the downtown area of the city.
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was a great host.  He was very responsive in communicating exactly how and we we could gain access to the house.  His description of how to find the house was spot on.  It was a perfect location and size for our little crew (boyfriend and two pups). The secluded front yard provided ample exploration space for my two dogs - definitely an unexpected treat.  Although the house has window units rather than central AC, they were more than enough, even in the August heat.  We would definitely stay here again!! Thank you Tyler!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, comfortable for 4 people. Easy to talk to, Tyler was very helpful with last minute booking."
,,,,,,,,Great place to experience Austin properly. Fantastic location. Quiet are bht close to everything. Smashing cd collection to keep entertained.
,,,,,,,,Everything was as you'd want it to be.  Plenty of cooling equipment for us wimpy PNWers.  Cheers.  
,,,,,,,,Love staying here! Always clean and nice.
,,,,,,,,"Tyler has a really prime location next to the graffiti wall and tons of little shops and restaurants. He was incredibly helpful, especially when it came to parking, and was very conscious of our group having personal space. I would stay again in a heartbeat."
,,,,,,,,Loved staying here. The location was great and the cottage was adorable and cozy. It was fantastic feeling like we had a house (and hard for the pup) to ourselves for the night to relax. Tyler was great also! 
,,,,,,,,Highly recommend staying here! The location is perfect and Tyler is great! 
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was a great host and the location was amazing. It couldn't get more convenient, as far as proximity to downtown and all there was to do in Austin. Made my vacation 1000x better."
,,,,,,,,Great bungalow on a hill near great restaurants and shops.  Tyler was pleasant and easy to work with.  
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great for our quick stay. Only stayed 1 night, was easy and Tyler was so helpful on some great and useful tips around the city. "
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my trip! The place is private, clean, and quiet. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was fantastic! The house was clean and just what we were expecting. It was very comfortable and there was no problems at all. Tyler was really nice and available very close by. Also, the neighbors were really awesome people. Definitely would stay again! "
,,,,,,,,Tyler is an excellent host.  He responded to all of my messages timely!!  Responsive and caring!  Thank you! 
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's place was very comfortable and clean. He was helpful and responsive when we reached out to him. Parking on the street right outside the apartment was very easy, and the place is located next to an awesome graffiti park, which was fun."
,,,,,,,,Lovely spot perched above one of Austin's most charming  neighborhoods. Very comfortable and clean accommodations with a lot of privacy. Would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,The place was in an amazing location and cool little neighborhood.  The house was very cute and tucked up on this hill which provided a great view of downtown.  The house was clean and tidy.  Tyler also let us stay a few hours past checkout to accommodate for our flight which was later in the day.  
,,,,,,,,"The bungalow is exactly as described.  Super cute, very comfortable bed, and clean.  Perfect location to get to everything we wanted to see for our quick trip to Austin.  We would definitely stay here again for our next trip to Austin.  The best part was being able to bring our dog :)"
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was a great host. When we arrived the place was spotless and there were even a few brewskies in the fridge for us.
 
The view from the patio was beautiful and the location was fantastic (within walking distance to the famous 6th St.).

The only slight issue we had was the air conditioning unit being positioned right next to the bed ( It was a bit noisy and interrupted our sleep a few times ) but besides this everything was great. 

I would definitely recommend this place for a young, fun, traveling couple or singles. I would definitely stay here again if coming back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Tyler had everything ready for us and made it easy. Comfortable place. Great location. Great stay. Recommended.
,,,,,,,,"Tyler provided a great experience by being a communicative host and by having one of the coolest places I've ever stayed. The house is nestled on a magical hillside surrounded by stone work and amazing plants. Decorations were interesting and unique, and the amenities were great. Located walking distance to awesome cultural stuff, shopping and amazing food and coffee. I will definitely be trying to book again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Actually an ""epic skyline view"", and there are some restaurants and cafes nearby. I didn't really meet with Tyler but he arranged everything in order before I came.  The room was nice and functional. In general it worked very well, and it would be better if the host could tidy up the bathroom floor and kitchen sink. "
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's place was great and the location was really nice. It was super easy to find, and was only a short Uber away from restaurants/bars. The front patio was our favorite part, with views of the entire city from the front door! 

I would definitely stay here again the next time I visit Austin."
,,,,,,,,Tyler's place was terrific! Close enough to downtown that I could walk anywhere I wanted to go. The bungalow was in great condition and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. Tyler was easy to communicate with and made sure I had everything I needed. Would definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,"I loved the location on the west side, up on a hill with fantastic views. The home was comfortable, spacious, with a charming deck. Everything worked great, nothing but compliments!"
,,,,,,,,Tyler's place was very close to downtown Austin! Literally can walk to whole foods and 6th st if your wanting to get a drink. Great with communication and had a very cozy place to stay! Enjoyed my visit would recommend!! 
,,,,,,,,Excellent stay. Clear directions as to access the unit and was even given a free upgrade to a private bungalow. Did not need to interact with the host but he made himself accessible via text.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment did not disapoint, great accomodations!"
,,,,,,,,"Cool neighborhood, the apartment was exactly what I needed."
,,,,,,,,"Tyler was there to welcome me and show me around the house. The location was awesome! I was able to walk to work (downtown on 6th Street) each morning, and everything I needed was close by (including the Wholefoods, yoga studio, etc.) The bungalow was clean and comfortable. I would totally stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,Tyler is a great host and provided easy directions to access his house. His house was perfect for a weekend stay in Austin. It's location very close to everything you could possibly want. The best part is the patio with the amazing view of downtown awesome! Would definitely book this again for future Austin trips.
,,,,,,,,"The location was great, Tyler was very responsive, and we enjoyed our brief visit there. Would definitely come back!"
,,,,,,,,"Stayed at Tyler's house for a few nights with friends and it was an awesome place to stay at overall! The house is literally next to the graffiti wall, which is an absolute place to visit when in Austin! The house is also very close to downtown and and taking an uber to and from downtown will be quick and inexpensive to do! The skyline from the house of downtown is almost unbeatable from most Airbnb listings! At night is when you get the best view because of the lights, but nonetheless it was awesome to wake up or go to bed and see the Austin Skyline from your porch!! I didn't get to meet Tyler, but he had neighbors that were really helpful if needed and they both provided me with their number in case I had any questions. Tyler was absolutely helpful from the start to the the end of our trip, and with this being my first time using Airbnb, he has set the bar high for other hosts to surpass!"
,,,,,,,,Tyler's place has a beautiful view of downtown Austin and a great location.
,,,,,,,,The location was great! It was in walking distance to some great restaurants and attractions. Tyler was great and was very quick to answer any questions or concerns I had. Amazing experience and would definitely come again!
,,,,,,,,Tyler's place was in a great location and was exactly what we were looking for during our brief stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Tyler is super welcoming and even waited up for us to show us around when we arrived late at night. The space was really adorable -- it's actually even better than the pictures let on and the location was perfect for us, it's super close to everything."
,,,,,,,,Great place! Exactly what we needed for the weekend. Would 100% recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Tyler provided us with good advice for transportation from the airport and was available for questions. This place is exactly as described in the post- great view, private, close to downtown. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying here was an all-around delightful experience.  Tyler answered all my questions quickly.  Once we arrived, it was easy to get in everything was very clean and well set up.  The view is amazing and it was really great to just sit on the front porch and watch the sunset over downtown Austin.  As an added bonus, the graffiti park walking distance away made the stay even better.  This will be a go-to spot for me on any trip to ATX."
,,,,,,,,"Tyler did a great job of communicating before and during our stay.  He was also very accommodating with allowing us to check in early since we were arriving in town before noon.  The premium is definitely in the location, it was awesome, as were the views. We really enjoyed exploring the graffiti murals next door, walking through the surrounding neighborhoods and to breakfast at Counter Cafe.  The apartment itself was basic and classic Austin, everything was ready for us when we arrived and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom could have used a bit more cleaning, but we figured it was just a quick job since he was trying to get us in early so it was no big deal.  Overall, it was a great place to stay and thanks for being pet friendly Tyler!"
,,,,,,,,"Tyler had a beautiful place. We were unable to meet him but he made getting into his place very easy. Tyler accepted a last minute booking and made communication very easy. The view of his place was amazing and there are some very iconic art walls right next door, which was one of my favorite things to see in Austin. Be prepared to walk up many steps to get to his place but the view is worth it. Thank you Tyler."
,,,,,,,,Location is close to city center.
,,,,,,,,Nice and tidy little cottage. Great location and a nice view. Had a great nap in the hammock out front which made my business trip feel like a little vacation.
,,,,,,,,Great accommodating host and very responsive. 
,,,,,,,,"It is a place to stay over if you are looking for nothing but location. 
The heating system was not working and we had to use two portable heaters which were not that helpful during winter. No clue of Wifi connection. Waited for hours for the host's respond."
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 46 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Right on about the view. The house sits on a hill! It was cute and cozy and had all the amenities you could possibly need. Tyler was very hospitable and suggested places to see nearby. 
,,,,,,,,"This place is the quintessential Austin vibe house! Having attended UT in the glory years of 68-70 I can attest that this space rocks! 8 minutes walk from Whole Foods on 6th street and Lamar, a great view of ""The Tower"" and the Capitol building, but with amazing privacy! And the prep by the host is amazing  - individual tooth brushes, hand wipes, toothpaste, facial scrub, mouthwash, liquid and bar bath soap, shampoo & conditioner - even disposable razors and shaving cream! Beer and filtered water in the fridge - many Airbnb hosts need to take heed and provide these essentials - only thing missing is a coffee maker - but hey, Whole Foods World headquarters is a 10 minute walk. I could easily spend hours sitting on the porch, with the Tiki lamps burning,  watching the hustle and bustle so far beneath me!"
,,,,,,,,"Great host, great location, great place to stay when visiting Austin!  Tyler was more than accommodating with flexible check-in/out times and my dogs---nice backyard area for the dogs.  Everything was easy, simple and hassle-free.  Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Tyler was an awesome host. The apartment was very clean and we had everything that we could have possibly needed. 
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's place was perfectly located.  It's set back just enough from the wild part of Austin, but no so far that you can't walk.  It's also near to a very funky public art project.  Tyler was incredibly helpful when I misread the address and called him, and his room mate was really friendly.  "
,,,,,,,,Tyler was a friendly and helpful hat and the house was clean. There are 2 very sweet dogs at the home (olive will play ball with you as long as you let her). The house is old so nothing fancy or swanky but perfect for a place to crash at night. Definitely recommend if you need a convenient location. 
,,,,,,,,Got the job done nicely for me while in Austin for a few days. I just need a place to land at night and a shower Cool historic area of Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Tyler was super flexible and responsive in accommodating our stay. The apartment's location is great (near the graffiti park!) and close to downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,Fantastic host and communication!
,,,,,,,,"I found the room to be the perfect no frills arrangement in a great location. If you really just need a place to crash and leave your stuff while you go out and explore this awesome city, this spot is ideal for you.  Not only is it near to the very cool Hope Outdoor Gallery (public graffiti exhibit) it is also walking distance from all the fun things 6th Street downtown ATX has to offer.  It was incredible easy to get around the DT area with this room as the starting spot. 

Though I never met Tyler, he was also quick to respond to my questions and make sure that I had what I needed for my stay. Very pleased with my experience here. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Tyler's home for SXSW. The bedroom was clean and spacious, and the house itself was located in a pretty good area, near to the Graffiti Park at Castle Hills. It was about a 20 minute walk from all the chaos around 6th/I-35 (or about a $10-15 Lyft ride back at the end of the night), and 5-minute walk to the Waterloo Records and the big flagship Whole Foods (both essential stops for me during SXSW). Tyler was not around, but he was easy to get a hold of by phone/e-mail, and his roommate Chris was a good and amiable host. I would highly recommend this place! "
,,,,,,,,Tyler welcomed me to his home on short notice and it was as advertised. He gave me some good places to eat and left me to myself. The location was great! it was very close to everything that I wanted to do on west 6th and also close to my office. I would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Tyler wasn't here during our stay but it was easy to email him. The location was great (Whole food and 24 Dinner). However I don't recommend this place if you are looking for a clean and warm (during winter) place to stay, and the minimum of furnitures (no chair in the bedroom to put our towels/cloths). The price seems too high for what it is."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Tyler's place.  The room was really nice and spacious.  Sheets and towels were prepared for me when I arrived and the room was in great condition.  The area is awesome, near to the graffiti wall which is pretty cool and walking distance to 6th street, UTA and The Texas Capital plus many other great places which was ideal for me since I was in town to visit those places mainly.  Thank you Tyler for your accommodation and thank you to Chris (his roommate) who was a great help while Tyler was out of town."
,,,,,,,,"I loved my stay at Tyler's house! The location was great and made for a comfortable home base for my time in Austin. Tyler is a terrific host - enjoyable conversation and spot-on recommendations for what to do in Austin. He and his housemate, Chris, are laid back and personable. I would love to stay here again if I find myself back in Austin (which I hope I do, because Austin is a great city!)"
,,,,,,,,"I only stayed for one night so didn't get to meet Tyler, but the room matched the description. The house is old but the room and bathroom were both clean. Location is very good, not far from downtown.  If you just need a place to crash for the night, without a lot of amenities, I would recommend it- it fit the bill for me. "
,,,,,,,,My stay was very easy and convenient. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Tyler lives in an incredible location. 
,,,,,,,,"My time at Tyler's apt was my first experience with Airbnb, and I was traveling to Austin during a major event -SXSW- that would collapse the city's lodging options, so I was a bit afraid something could turn wrong. 

My fears proved unfounded. The apartment was just great --an awesome room, clean common areas and an almost unbeatable location (25-minute walk to the city downtown, with a public bicycle station, a 7-Eleven and a Whole Foods just a few blocks away). Tyler and his roommate were extremely easy going and helpful, giving me tips about Austin and the apartment since the very moment I booked the room. 

I would definitely recommend Tyler's place!"
,,,,,,,,"If just need a place to crush at night and don't care about amenities and facilities then this might be okay. Otherwise, I would say this place might shock you as it looks better than it actually is in reality"
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's place in Austin was just what we were looking for when we stayed there for 4 nights surrounding the F1 weekend. It's in a great location, about 15 minutes walk from the busy bits of town, was clean and we were made to feel very welcome.

Tyler and his housemate were both very easy to get on with and we went out for food and drinks a couple of times while we were staying there. Over a few drinks plenty of local knowledge of where to go in town was taken in! Austin proved to be a fantastic place, and I hope to return at some point in the future!

If you're looking for somewhere to stay without the steep hotel prices and some friendly hosts, then look no further!"
,,,,,,,,We had a fabulous stay at Tyler's place in Austin. The apartment is in a great location (it was easy to walk most places we wanted to go) and it's also very comfortable and clean! Highly recommend
,,,,,,,,Our stay went smoothly.  Any questions we had were answered quickly and it was easy to get to.  There was street parking across the street and a few places near-by perfect for late night.   
,,,,,,,,This is a great place to stay. Easy walking distance to the grocery store or anywhere else you would need to go. The guys were very easy going and made me feel right at home.
,,,,,,,,"I had a very good stay at Tyler's place. Tyler is really down to earth and made sure I had everything I needed. Public transport to 6th street is within walking distance (10min), and you could even walk to 6th street yourself if you're up for it (25min). Kitchen was very good with good cooking equipment to make small or big meals. Dryer and washing machine work and Tyler keeps his room pretty clean. Queen size bed is comfortable.

The only thing that could have been better was the airco in the room. The airco makes some noise so I turned it down while sleeping. It wasn't that much of a problem because the room stays cold long enough for me to fall asleep,  but worth mentioning.

All in all a very good experience and would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Tyler did a great job of communicating before, during and after our stay. The apartment was clean and everything was ready for us when we arrived. The bed was comfortable. It was a great place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Tyler's place was great for SXSW! His apartment was about a 20 minute walk from all the action on 6th Street. Very convenient. The neighbourhood was safe and there were some cool little cafes and bars near by. The shower worked well, a washing machine and dryer were available which I used twice with no issues and the bedroom I accommodated was very comfortable and clean. Also had access to wi-fi which I had no issue with what so ever (way quicker than Australian wi-fi actually).

On top of all this Tyler made a real effort as host to give me some tips about the city and some ins and outs of the festival. Very much appreciated when travelling on your own.

To summarise, perfect for what I was after for my week of SXSW. Thanks heaps Tyler."
,,,,,,,,"Three of my friends and I stayed here for spring break. Location was great and a fairly short walk from downtown Austin. A 7-Eleven is just a few minutes away for late night snacks and drinks. 

There are two rooms and a loft which fit all four of us quite comfortably. Overall apartment was quite cozy and for our needs well. "
,,,,,,,,"The Room was similar to the pictures advertised, the bed was comfortable.  The other amenities were lacking or malfunctioning.   The main areas of the apartment are not comfortable or clean, especially in hot months. The internet was very slow, the oven was not usable and the shared bathroom was disappointing. 

The location is unbeatable.  It is easy to access 6th street and the Whole Foods is within walking distance.  There is plenty of street parking and access to Mopac is also easy.  "
4013329,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Everything was exactly as described on the website. Hosts were gracious, timely and the location was excellent...a very cozy, historical home with character! It was way better than a typical boring hotel room. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed overnight to attend a conference at the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center a few blocks away. I arrived a bit late and it was raining so hard, I initially had difficulty seeing the number address on the house. Before getting out of my vehicle in the pouring rain, I called Ted to confirm I was at the correct place. He went above and beyond the call of duty and came outside with a big umbrella to help direct me to the correct spot. There is a lovely, unexpectedly large courtyard space as you walk on the property. It felt like an oasis in the middle of town. It was surprisingly quiet considering it's central, downtown location. You can tell a lot of thought and planning went into making sure everything you need is available: fridge with drinks, Kuerig machine and a nice selection of K-cups, an assortment of tea and a bowl of candy to satisfy a midnight sweet tooth attack! There's a small dining table in the kitchen area. A nice-sized bathroom with a shower. There were plenty of fresh towels and everything was extremely clean and well-organized. Great stay and wonderful host!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was fabulous!  Ted was a wonderful host, and the place is great.  I couldn't have been happier with my decision to stay there and will definitely try to stay here again when I'm back in Austin!

The neighborhood where this property is located is quiet and safe.  I didn't have any trouble walking around at night.  "
,,,,,,,,Great location within reasonable walking distance from downtown. Excellent hosts with much attention to detail.
,,,,,,,,Great location and friendly/knowledgeable host.
,,,,,,,,"A lovely place with lovely hosts, I enjoyed my time here.  The bed is incredibly comfortable, and the small kitchenette had the essentials for making coffee, which is a must for me.  The bathroom was a good fit for me, and the towels were so soft.  I wish it had been cooler outside so I could have enjoyed the outdoor patio--it looked so inviting!  While there is a private entrance, it is to the alleyway, which made me a little squeamish as I was walking most everywhere or meeting a cab on the street.  However, if you have a car, this shouldn't be an issue as you can park directly by the private entrance.  I also had an issue with spotty WiFi, but I have no doubt that it will be quickly corrected.   "
,,,,,,,,"The place is very conveniently located. Janelle was friendly and very helpful. The suite is clean and beautiful. We will definitely stay there if we are back in Austin.
"
,,,,,,,,"We loved this place! Ted was there to greet us and show us where everything was. He was available but unintrusive. 
There was plenty of space, everything was very clean, and the bed was comfortable. 
It was a very cute efficiency apartment! There was a coffeemaker in the kitchen with all the fixings. 
The neighborhood was also nice and we felt very safe. 
I highly recommend Ted's place! "
,,,,,,,,"My wife Theresa and I booked a three day stay for the Eleven Oak Suite  during the Memorial Day Holiday 2016.   Ted, our host, met us in front of the historic Edward Clark House and immediately showed us to our assigned parking space and suite.   It was an efficient check in process.   The courtyard was beautiful and the suite spacious with an elegant decor.   We were also introduced to the very cordial cat mascot of the property who lounged on the picnic table outside the suite (though I can not recall his name at this time).      Ted immediately showed us how to access Wi-Fi and provided a guide on Austin hot spots.      As someone else mentioned, it is indeed an Oasis in the middle of historic downtown Austin, where you hear the birds chirping, squirrels climbing the beautiful oaks (that must be hundreds of years old).  The checkout process was also orderly.     We plan to again reserve the Eleven Oaks Suite at the Clark House when we return to Austin for business and vacation trips and we recommend that you do the same.    Compared to the luxury hotels a few blocks away, you get a historic, comfortable, quiet and quaint suite with a lot of character.    Therefore, you get a lot of value for your dollar.   
Cheers 
Scott and Theresa Smaistrla

,,,,,,,,"Ted and his family are great hosts, very friendly and helpful! Their home is beautiful and very comfortable. The closeness to downtown Austin was also great, I was able to walk to and from my conference easily. "
,,,,,,,,Fantastic location and space! Beautiful hardwoods! Great parking! Nicest hosts in the world!
,,,,,,,,"My sister and her boyfriend enjoyed very much their stay at the Downtown Oasis. It's within walking distance to most activities and museums- although it was raining. The bedroom they had was very nice and super clean, including a cute little kitchenette and a breakfast nook. Janelle the host was very courteous."
,,,,,,,,"The Downtown Oasis really is a terrific location -an ""oasis"" indeed, under large live oaks - in a neighborhood away from the noise of downtown but close enough to walk to many locations (UT, Capitol, downtown, Lamar Blvd). If needed, Ted was readily available via txt & checked in to see that all was well & gave excellent advice on local places - without being overly solicitous. It's a tastefully decorated suite with all the kitchen & other essentials for my mini-vacation/business trip!  (& happily for me, no perfumed decorative objects)  I've already recommended it to others & hope to return!"
,,,,,,,,The host was very attentive and friendly. I would visit this again. 
,,,,,,,,"Ted was away so we were warmly greeted by his wife, Janelle. The unit was lovely as portrayed. For tourists, the location is fabulous -- 10 minutes' walk to the Capitol, 15-20 minutes to downtown o rate UT campus. Private parking and a safe location."
,,,,,,,,"We had a lovely time staying in Ted's suite. It was clean and VERY well appointed, with everything you might have forgotten to bring. The location was excellent for taking long walks downtown and along the water, and the book of restaurants was also very useful. We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great stay all around!  Ted and his wife we're warm and welcoming.  They gave a quick overview of the room and showed me how to work the back gate (main entrance for guests).  They were responsive to any questions (text or phone) and just nice people overall.

My room was accurate to how it's describe in the ad and photographs.  It was well appointed with basic hotel-like amenities.  The small kitchenette was nice  feature.  The original Whole Foods isn't far away, so you can easily stock up.  The location is in a quite historic section of downtown Austin.  You can easily walk to the Capitol Building and 6th street is about 10-15 +/- minutes away.  Uber is the easiest way to get around Austin though.

Great place for someone traveling solo or a couple looking to have a memorable stay in the live music capitol of the world. "
,,,,,,,,"Quiet well appointed room with non advertised extras.
Excellent communication and seamless processing."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great time in the Downtown Oasis. Ted is a wonderful host who is always there if you are in need of his help with your trip. If not, it is entirely possible to enjoy a time and space of your own in the beautiful guesthouse with its separate entrance. A number of amenities in the house, such as a coffeemaker and an information book about restaurants, definitely enriched my trip. Thanks, Ted, I had a great time thanks to you!"
,,,,,,,,Was made to feel very welcome.  Their are so well set up for what they do - visitors welcome pack was great.  Thank you for a lovely stay.
,,,,,,,,What a find. Lovely spacious and quiet but a short walk to all the downtown attractions. Very friendly and helpful hosts who have thought about what a visitor may need and then provided it. Can't recommend highly enough.
,,,,,,,,"This place was amazing for our visit to Austin.  The location was perfect, and the atmosphere and accommodations were quant and exceeded expectations.  Ted was a very friendly and gracious host, overall we could not have asked for any more!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Amazing property, nice space and great host! Ted was very welcoming and even provided a couple free beverages!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"What a most wonderful host and location. Ted was very easy to communicate with and ready upon my arrival.

The accommodations were pristine, comfortable, and well appointed. The Keurig coffee supplies and maker were a nice touch, in addition to the other included beverages. The suite is spacious and located very close to great food and entertainment.

I will most definitely be staying at this Austin Oasis again! Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,Ted and Janelle were so helpful and welcoming. Their beautiful home is quiet and cozy. I had a wonderful night's sleep on a very comfy bed. I woke up refreshed and ready for a full day of meetings. I hope to make it back to enjoy their lovely suite!
11455983,5,10,9,10,10,9,10,Nice place!! 
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was perfect!  The location of Leanne's place really can't be beat.  We had amazing views of downtown and the Congress Street bridge, while being somewhat tucked away on the south side of the river.  Still, we were only minutes from every Austin attraction, such as Downtown, the Capital, South Austin, East Side..... this location is quite perfect. 
The apartment is small, but  very smartly appointed and perfectly sized for 1 or 2 people. 
Leanne and the staff were on point and helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"The Catherine was a great location, was clean, new, and minimally equipped.
We had not been to Austin before, I was helping my daughter move from San Francisco to a new job in Austin. We were disappointed with the communication from LuAnn. Upon arrival the email instructions for parking and use of the elevators was confusing. We were disappointed that the apartment did not have a home manual for the space or area. I contacted LuAnn the next day with a couple of questions and asked for suggestions for breakfast etc. She instructed me to ""(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it"" as far as places to go and told me how to log on to the wifi, which I did not ask how to do, as it was in an email prior to arrival. After her response it was evident we were on our own and we figured it all out. I rented for 16 days and she never reached out to us once. "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome luxury apartment-helped us really consider the type of living and location we want to experience on a daily basis while visiting and considering our move to Austin in the next few months! So clean, so luxurious, so close to everything the city has to offer. I felt very safe, was not inconvenienced or bothered by noisy neighbors (can't hear anything through the walls), and easy access to so many great indoor and outdoor activities! "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location and apartment. So easy to w alk to South Congress, the bats, the lake, and really anywhere else. Great pool, workout center, and front desk staff!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was incredible. Perfect size, amazing view, ideal bed and bathroom. Staff at the Catherine were really nice. We were able to walk everywhere. A 10."
,,,,,,,,"A beautiful apartment and a beautiful new building 
Great views
Parking provided"
,,,,,,,,"LeeAnn was incredibly friendly and responsive to my numerous questions. Her warm southern hospitality was wonderful. 

The unit was impeccably decorated and the view of the lake can't be beat. The Catherine has luxury amenities including coffee for their guests, a pent house club room, gorgeous pool, and so much more we didn't even get to take advantage of.

The location is well situated near delicious dining, hip bars, downtown and recreational opportunities. It is walkable to some fun dining options. We will definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment and building were beautiful. Everything was clean and organized and I had a great stay! 
,,,,,,,,"LeeAnn had wonderful communication and was very responsive. Everything was laid out nicely for my arrival and check-in was SUPER easy and convenient. 

That apartment was lovely and exactly as pictured. Would 100% use again."
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic stay at The Catherine.   Extremely well equipped unit with an exceptional view of Austin.  Great location as well, with downtown and South Congress just a short walk away.  Building has so many fantastic amenities that it was difficult to leave.   I would recommend staying here to anyone.  "

This is definitely going in my favorites to stay every time I come to Austin. Thanks, Ryan for making my first trip to AUSTIN stress free and amazing!"
,,,,,,,,It was a great place! The central location made it the perfect for wandering around downtown Austin.
,,,,,,,,Very responsive and welcoming. Great location and very comfortable 
,,,,,,,,Ryan's place was in a great location. very clean and had everything you need for a weekend or even quick stay. I will def be back and using this place on a regular basis since I am in Austin all the time.
,,,,,,,,The place was located in the best part of Austin. We were able to walk to everything.  The host and property manager were very responsive and easy to talk to. I would recommend staying here!!!  
,,,,,,,,"The complex was really cute,  we loved the location.  Parking was simple. The unit had everything we needed and that was listed. Communication was simple and prompt. Would definitely recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Clean and convenient - had everything we needed in the flat ( laundry, dishwasher, extra towels, and even shampoo/ soaps etc. ) good to have a secure parking area in city centre as well. "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed for ACL and the location of this place was great! It was close and walking distance to a number of things and the space itself was clean and spacious. They gave us a novel of instructions, tips, and places to go and was very responsive when we had a question prior to our trip. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I were in Austin to visit family, as well as enjoy a weekend away. This accommodation was perfect for our needs. It was just as pictured. Very clean. Appreciated the large modern kitchen, as well as washer-dryer in unit. We did not use the pool, but it looked like it would be nice to take a dip. The price was quite reasonable when compared with hotels in the neighborhood. The free parking was probably the best value added of this place. It is difficult to get around Austin without a car and paying for parking at a hotel would have cost more than the car rental itself. We would absolutely recommend this AirBNB to friends. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location and spacious 1 bedroom, near 6th street and easy walking to many restaurants, shops and bars. Comes with parking spot if you are driving. "
,,,,,,,,Ryan was very easy to communicate with and gave us a heads up when there was to be a fire alarm inspection as well! I booked his place for one of my senior team and he had a great stay.
,,,,,,,,"The place is great. The location is great. A bit noisy at times because of party people at the pool, but still cool.   It was the interaction/service that fell short for me. had problems with no towels on arrival, no internet signal for last couple days and construction going on next door condo for 4 days.  Problems  happen, I'm reasonable. It's how they are addressed that matters and Thomas (Ryan's rep) was very nice but ineffective and failed to get back to me.  There's a lot going for this place, but I'd probably try somewhere else on my next visit.    "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, central to everything, good value. Photos are representative, host Ryan was responsive and pleasant."
,,,,,,,,Location of this place is fantastic. it's very clean and neat. Ryan was a great host. responded promptly. Thank you for everything.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Ryan's Retro Chic listing was very nice. There were access/entry issues initially, but were solved quickly and over the phone. Otherwise, the place was great! I was given detailed instructions in an email for all aspects of our stay ahead of time, including check-in, parking, and internet info--as well as places to visit. 

Parking and access via keypad was extremely convenient. The kitchen, dining, and living spaces were as described and very clean. I wish I could have spent more time here--but I was having too much fun enjoying the city. The location is great for 6th street and access to downtown."
,,,,,,,,"This was a great rental.  Clean, quiet, very convenient for everything I needed to do.  Was a little pricey, but hard to gripe about that given all the other benefits, including covered parking!  The sofa was not comfortable for sitting (didn't use the fold out), and the lack of beside tables/lamps in bedroom made reading difficult.  Will definitely use this place again."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed in Austin over the Memorial weekend at Ryan's apartment.
The location is fantastic, only a couple of blocks away from 6th street.
The apartment is perfect, great amenities, everything was as described in the details.
Ryan was a fantastic host, extremely accommodating, provided lots of information about the apartment and things to do and see in Austin.
I would definitely recommend this apartment and eagerly stay here again the next time I'm in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Wine was waiting in fridge to celebrate a big occasion. Great communication. Made it easy for us!
,,,,,,,,"This spot was perfect -- super-cute, spacious and above-all, central! It's right in the heart of downtown, walkable and bikable to everywhere you'd want to go. Definitely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,Ryan's place was AWESOME. All the directions in the welcome email were on point and it was super clean and convenient. Highly recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan provided us with a wonderful host experience that any hotel would be unable to match. His welcome email was super-informative and warm, giving us detailed information about the residence as well as a ton of recommendations for what to do in Austin during our stay. Check-in was extremely easy and the apartment was exactly as pictured - well-decorated, extremely clean, and stocked with everything from towels and toiletries to coffee and diningware. The apartment complex itself is well-maintained and mostly quiet (save for the excitement happening at the communal pool pretty much throughout the daytime) and SO conveniently located in downtown Austin, in walking distance to Sixth Street, the Capitol, Congress, bars, restaurants, you name it.

The only slightly negative aspect of the experience: the wi-fi and cable were very unreliable, though we weren't in the apartment that much that we needed to use it. Also, the cleaning service came in to clean the apartment a few days early, thinking our stay was over - luckily, we were in the apartment to let her know that wasn't the case.

All in all, awesome experience. Thank you, Ryan!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great apartment - would recommend to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"The location was perfect for all things down-town Austin.  The Capitol Metro Bus from the Airport stops a block away - $1.75 each way.  The apartment was clean, tidy & well-appointed.   The owner gave us very detailed instructions for check-in and check-out, as well as great tips on local attractions.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,Great place.  Great instructions.  Lots of room.  Very clean.  Excellent location.  I really liked it.  I'll stay here again.  
,,,,,,,,"This is the perfect for a trip to Austin, it couldn't be more central and the apartment set up and lay out gives you everything you need for a home base while you explore the city.

The pictures are an accurate representation of what the apartment looks like and it is very clean and presentable.

Great value too considering I visited during South by, an all round perfect experience, so thanks Ryan.

Aaron"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was very accommodating from the moment that I requested a booking and throughout the process.  He sent a very detailed email that included all of the information I needed for my trip--so detailed that I never needed to reach out for anything.  It was smooth and easy from start to finish.  

The space itself was just as described and such a nice alternative to the many hotels nearby.  It was fully stocked with all of the essentials.  If you're planning on cooking, the kitchen is perfect for you.  But it's Austin, so eat out!  "
,,,,,,,,Ryan was an outstanding host! The place was everything described and more. Absolutely immaculate and perfect location! Can't wait to stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Excellent downtown location.  One bedroom apartment with everything we expected.  Communication with our host was easy. Parking space was useful.  Our stay totally meet expectation. We are staying in a larger apartment with Ryan in May.
,,,,,,,,"Check in was very simple and straightforward, didn't even have to meet the host. Apartment was in a perfect location just 2 blocks from East 6th street. Beautiful cozy apartment as well. Would definitely return here. The only thing that could use improvement is the slow wi-fi. We went a few blocks away to Starbucks to get work done."
,,,,,,,,Great stay cozy and very home warming... Ryan was a great host even for being a last minute stay he made the transition very  accessible... 2 thumbs up recommend this unit anytime... 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's apt. was very clean and in a perfect location. 6th, Rainey & Congress are all totally walk-able. There also wasn't a lot of street noise b/c the bedroom is on the front part of the apt. The upstairs occupants were awake at some off hours and the sounds of them walking and moving chairs around woke me up a few times, but I am a light sleeper. 
Ryan gave a whole list of places to visit and was easy to get in touch with if needed. 
Very well priced for such a great location. The apt. is also across the street from Wanderlust Yoga Studio which was a huge plus for me!"
,,,,,,,,"Retro Chic was a great little apartment right in the centre of Downtown Austin. The apartment was in great condition, clean, and had everything you would need for a short or extended day. Entry and checkout were easy and convenient."
,,,,,,,,"This space is in a fantastic neighborhood and within walking distance of many shops, bar, restaurants, yoga, etc. We loved our stay in the apartment. The place was clean and convenient. Definitely a downtown Austin living experience."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location, exactly where you want to be while visiting Austin. Easy access to everything. Apartment is exactly how it is described. Very safe/secure feeling as well. Ryan was great to work with. A+"
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great host, and great location in Austin! Very clean and comfortable space. Near some great bars and restaurants!"
,,,,,,,,"We had just a fantastic week staying in this apartment. 
Everything was perfect, the location was great. We really were in the heart of the city!
Thomas was super friendly and helpful and any questions were answered promptly. 
We really couldn't have asked for more. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and amazing host! Definitely would stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice condo, nice apartment complex. Pool was emaculate. "
,,,,,,,,"Great Apartment in a great locaction. The apartment has everything you need and is walking distance from everything that Austin has to offer (6th St, Rainey St). Ryan is very easy to deal with and even offers you tips on the city. I'd definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and the apartment was even better than the photos.  I had a very comfortable stay here!
,,,,,,,,"I rented 5 apartments from Ryan on Air BnB for a weekend in Austin (getting my MBA at UChicago and we only travel in packs); the Speakeasy, Retro Chic, Argyle, Grant Austin, and the Cosmopolitan. The apartments are well furnished and well kept. 

Ryan and his property manager (Thomas) are extremely accessible and helpful. All of my questions were quickly answered and it was nice that they checked in with us during the weekend, and were extremely flexible on the check in / check out times. 

The only thing (and this is CLEARLY written in the apartment descriptions, so its just something I should have thought about more carefully) is that it sometimes does really stink to sleep on air mattresses, so if you can at all, I'd highly recommend you only bring enough people that there are beds for. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location right in downtown. Walkable score: high. Perfect for SXSW. Host prepped the place so it was spotless and well arranged. 
Has all you need to spend a great weekend in Austin. Would definitely rent again and recommend to friends and family."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was a great host and sent a ton of info about the apartment, Austin's best sights and was always available to answer any questions. The apartment is immaculate, resembles the pictures exactly and is literally the best place to stay downtown. It's within walking distance to all major attractions and if you're attending conference at the convention centre then you're literally a one minute walk away. Highly recommend this apartment and Ryan as a host. "
,,,,,,,,The location was terrific - close to downtown (CBD) and 6th Street. Lost of places to eat and hang out. Room is just as it appears. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's place is great. Super clean, convenient downtown location, and has everything you need for your stay. Definitely recommend it if you're headed out to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"A great experience all around. The apartment is in the most convenient place, centrally downtown without the street being overcome with pedestrians. The parking is great, secure and easy to access. The apartment itself has everything you need to feel like you're at home and the description is accurate. The guys were super helpful and quick to respond to any questions I had. Thank you for a great experience - I would definitely come back."
,,,,,,,,"The place was awesome! It's exactly as it looks in all the pictures. The best part about the experience was that Ryan sent an email a few days before my stay that had everything in it regarding logistics (checkin, checkout, how to get in) as well really interesting recommendations and guides to Austin. It was a great experience. The location is perfect as well - right in the heart of downtown and just a few blocks from 6th street. "
,,,,,,,,Excellent apartment in the heart of Austin. The apartment was exactly as described and made for a great trip. Would highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was was incredible! The unit was gorgeous, clean, and spacious, as well as super close to everything downtown.   Ryan was a super gracious host- personable & professional. His property manager, Thomas, was also super helpful and positive.  Super quick to answer any questions. We had a problem with the WiFi, and they showed up within an hour with a  paid AT&T hotspot for us to use during our stay. Class act."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan is an amazing host and works diligently to give his visitors a perfect experience when visiting Austin. Having stayed at multiple properties of Ryan's, I will say that each property has a unique vibe which is both inviting and totally Austin. The proximity of these places cannot be beat! You will not go wrong staying in any of Ryan's properties. "

,,,,,,,,Jay's place is perfect for an Austin trip. Close location to everything. Apartment is spacious and well furnished. We had a great time. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,Very nice listing and close to downtown. Lots of fun and very responsive! Thanks for everything Jay!
,,,,,,,,"Jay's apt was exactly how it's described! Clean, comfortable, and lots of space!  Most importantly, the location was unparalleled! Quick walk to most of 6th street. South Congress Ave was just 1-2 miles away, a quick cab ride. Maybe most impressive of all was that Franklin's Barbecue was literally right around the corner! We had a great time and would recommend this to anyone. "
,,,,,,,,"Space was awesome, Jay is super friendly, location was great and we had a great time! "
,,,,,,,,"Jay was great, really attentive and his place was excellent for our needs. Thanks! "
,,,,,,,,"Four of us came to Austin for ACL weekend and had a wonderful time staying in Jay's beautiful apartment. The furnishings are beautiful, tasteful and modern and the whole apartment was lovely. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were large which made getting ready together very easy. We used the Keurig to make coffee each morning and even hooked up to his Apple TV to play our music in the morning. Jay is very humble, but he's actually an accomplished bartender and owns a very elegant cocktail bar downtown and has been featured in magazines like GQ for his craft cocktails and has won numerous international awards. We enjoyed stopping by his bar for a drink and he even came and chatted and sat with us for a bit. The apartment location is convenient to downtown, especially sixth street (15 minute walk) but Rainey Stret is a tad further and it was a bit far from Zilker where ACL is held, but we were still able to walk or take the free shuttle. There is a CVS right by the apartment which was convenient for picking up forgotten items. My only suggestion is that it would be nice to receive two key sets as we did not all come home together each night and it would have been convenient to be able to let ourselves in separately. I would highly recommend staying here on your Austin visit!"
,,,,,,,,Jay's place is a small walk from 6th and is in a really nice building. Every picture was spot on and a group of 6 stayed without a problem and lots of sleeping space. 
,,,,,,,,We loved staying here! 
,,,,,,,,"A great experience! Jay was quick to respond to the request and reached out to be as helpful as possible for our trip. Unfortunately, I personally was unable to make the trip due to a last minute change in circumstances, however Jay was very gracious in his willingness to coordinate with the remainder of my group, all of whom had nothing but awesome things to say about Jay and his place. Would absolutely book with him again, if for no other reasons than jealousy my friends got to stay there and the chance to meet Jay myself. Cheers!"
,,,,,,,,Jay was unbelievably hospitable. The apartment is a great space with a  wonderful view of downtown. He was very helpful in providing suggestions of activities to do in Austin. All in all apartment was gorgeous and would stay again!
,,,,,,,,Jay was great - Location made access to the Convention Center a problem (especially in the intense heat that week)
,,,,,,,,"Jay was easy to communicate with, making our stay very smooth. His place is in a great location near downtown Austin and the space was in perfect condition when we arrived. My friends and I had a great time in Austin and were very happy to be able to walk back to the apartment after a night downtown."
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment in a perfect location.  Easy/quick access to downtown.  Apartment was very clean and well-furnished.  Jay was very welcoming and quickly answered each question we sent to him, both prior to and during our stay.  I highly recommend this apartment. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place location, very clean place and very spacious.  "
,,,,,,,,"Jay was very communicative, helpful and welcoming. The place was just as described, maybe even better! Very nicely furnished, comfortable, quiet and easy walking to downtown. I highly recommend it! "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful, huge apartment. Amazing view. I'm super jealous i can't live there. Justin/Jay was awesome, very cool guy. "
,,,,,,,,Very nice apartment with all the essentials and a good host. Little farther from downtown than expected (airbnb should update map location to east of interstate).
,,,,,,,,"Justin was a great host! His apartment was very warm and inviting and you can't beat the location. Being super close to downtown, Rainey Street and the East side made our stay extremely worthwhile. He did a great job of making us feel welcome and was very attentive during our stay. We went to pretty much all of his restaurant and bar recommendations, so definitely ask him for help in that category - he knows a thing or two! For this being my first Air bnb experience, I definitely know that I'll continue to use it in other cities that I visit. "
,,,,,,,,Jay was an amazing host. He met up with us at midnight after our flight was delayed by some hours. The house was quite exceptional especially for the price we paid and a number of our friends who lived locally in the area were also quite impressed by the layout and also the value. I highly recommend this property to any future travelers to Houston.
,,,,,,,,"Wow where do I start with Jays place, amazing!! 

The location is walkable distance to the bars on 6th street but still far enough away to not be troubled by the noise. You are next to the freeway but can not hear much outside noise as the windows are quite sound proof.

his apartment is very comfortable and has everything you need to make your stay comfortable, including an amazing kitchen!!

Jays communication was first class and would stay again if in Austin.....................and Mi Casa Tu Casa when ever he wants to come to Australia :) "
,,,,,,,,"Just stayed at Jay's apartment over the weekend for a bachelorette party. Loved that he had everything set up for us, with gum and candy in the bathrooms. The apartment was the perfect size for 5 of us. His place is across the street from the famous Franklin BBQ, huge perk. And within walking distance to plenty of food trucks & bars. A quick cab ride from the airport and soco, even quicker to 6th & rainey streets for going out at night. Awesome! Thanks Jay!"
,,,,,,,,Great experience. Place was bigger and nicer than expected. Very clean. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,Beautiful place with amazing view!  The house was immaculate and had nice little touches like gum in the bathroom! 4 stars definitely will consider this place again! 
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing weekend and it all started with Jay and his apartment.  We arrived on a Friday afternoon and departed Monday afternoon.  As a host, he was flexible, respectful, and incredibly easy going.  His apartment was spotless on arrival.  I know most people wish their place could look like his.  The location of his place was perfect for our group.  It was a nice walk to either 6th Street or Rainey Street at night.  We never felt like the walk was too far for anything we wanted to do.  We had a 4 seat car to cover the 6 of us, so we picked his place for its prime location. 
I would HIGHLY recommend Jay as a host and his apartment as an ideal venue for any time spent in Austin.  If I ever go back, I know where I am going.  Thanks again for a great weekend, Jay. "
,,,,,,,,The place was great!  Jay was great!  Looking forward to the next time.
,,,,,,,,Awesome location (right next to Franklin BBQ) and a super accommodating host. Jay made our stay extremely easy and the place was amazing.
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience using AirBnB, and it was amazing! Jay was totally communicative and an excellent host, and the apartment - PERFECT. My friends and I who stayed for a few days were very comfortable and also impressed with everything from the decor, to the packs of gum that were laid out for us in each bathroom. The location was great - not too far from all the downtown happenings, and if I were to stay in Austin again it would more than likely be at this exact location. Thanks for making my AirBnB experience a great one!"
,,,,,,,,"Jay was so accommodating and pleasant! He allowed us to check in 30 minutes early and leave about an hour late, and he promptly responded to phone calls and text messages. His apartment was spacious, clean, and beautiful. The entire stay was perfect!"
,,,,,,,,"Jay has probably the nicest place I've ever stayed in. Plus he's also a super nice guy. The furniture was brand new and everything was so well decorated and organized. Every room had it's own tv and appletv. Wow. It had everything you'd want/need and really was the ideal place to spend the weekend. It's relatively close to all the bars downtown and on the east side so you could either walk (10-15min) or drive (3min). Me and my friends prefer the east side so it was literally a few blocks from all those restaurants and bars. Parking was super easy and convenient in and around his building. Keep in mind that it is right next to the highway so you do get some traffic noise but if you're used to city life, it's worth the view and the morning light. I'll definitely be giving Jay a shout the next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"A spacious and comfortable 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment within close vicinity to the heart of Austin! A short walk to 6th street and a little further to the Capitol, UT and farmers market on the weekend. Make sure to check out Rainey Street at night (15 min walk), a whole street of houses converted into bars! A place called Half Step will make you a fine cocktail."
,,,,,,,,Excellent host...very communicative...checked on us daily during out stay...lots of suggestions re local resources...great place...very clean and fully stocked...will be back

14945782,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Troy is the best host in Austin and offers a clean and convenient place to stay. I could walk to all of my destinations and had a phenomenal view of the city from my window! I will definitely stay here again when I come back to visit Austin.
,,,,,,,,This apartment is right outside of downtown in a nice neighborhood and it has an awesome view of the skyline. I was comfortable there and had everything I needed. I would definitely stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,Troy is fantastic. Great host and easy to work with!
,,,,,,,,"Would recommend this apartment to everyone, especially someone who is looking for a place close to downtown. Also loved the ability to walk to Zilker and amazing restaurants! Troy was very responsive and made sure we knew how to get around. Would rent this apartment again!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great apartment for anyone wanting to explore Austin. The location is perfect, near downtown and convenient for shops. Checking in was easy and Troy made sure he was there to hand over the keys and show me the house. I had a great stay here and would definitely recommend this airbnb to other Austin visitors. "
,,,,,,,,"10/10 - I cannot described a better host. Troy was extremely helpful in learning what is happening in the city. I had to show up a little late and was able to easily find and get into the apartment. The pictures don't do it justice. It's an easy 5-10 minutes walk to everything important downtown. I can't stress that enough, the location is amazing! i wold gladly stay there again next time I'm in the city. "
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay at Troy's place.  Troy is a super nice guy, and he wants to make sure his guests are taken care of.  I had an earlier than expected check-in and Troy made accommodations to his schedule to get me into the apartment about 1.5 hours early.  Troy was very welcoming and offered lots of advice about how to get around Austin.  He was also very responsive during my stay.  

Troy's place is very simple, yet functional.   Everything was very clean and taken care of.  The bed was very comfortable, the wifi worked well, and the place is in an excellent location.  There is only an HDMI cable for the tv, so if you want to watch Netflix be sure to bring your computer.  This wasn't an issue for me because I was not in the apartment for extended periods of time.  

Overall, this place is a very good deal considering the location.  Will definitely keep this on my list of places to stay when in Austin!"
5046776,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Miles was available for our check in that evening. We were shown around and provided directions and instructions on how to use the facility. He gave us a good brief about town. The house was clean and full of towels, as were the trailers. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is fantastic. If you're on the fence about staying here - just DO it. I'm trying to think of my next shindig that I want to throw here. 

We got married, after spending a few days onsite with our family and friends from out of town/state. It was a super fun place to hang out. Plenty of nooks to be alone if you wanted, but great spaces to hang out together. 

Then we got married onsite and also had the reception there. It held over 100 people very nicely, and a 5 piece band, and tables for food and desserts. And everyone RAVED about the location and the space.

The place is so much better than pictures can show you. Plus Miles and Joe make you feel so welcome. There was NOTHING bad about the spot at all. Just do it. You know you wanna! "
,,,,,,,,Miles is a ruler! Camp Congress is a wonderful alternative to the norms of lodging. We all had a great time and Miles was super helpful for anything we needed. Hope to make it back to Camp Congress!
,,,,,,,,"This place is great! The location is very close to everything you need and want to see in Austin.  The air streams were so cool and really gave the complex a unique feel.  Miles was a perfect host and was willing to accommodate our large group.  Thanks miles for making us feel welcome, great weekend stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"Miles is the ultimate host. Not only is the place perfect - spacious, comfortable, clean, well-appointed - but he is beyond accommodating. From allowing us to check in early, to visiting the property to make sure that we had everything set up to our satisfaction, to inviting us to tailgate with him at the football game, he was gracious and welcoming, attentive throughout the weekend and responsive to all our communications. The logistical challenges of coordinating 14 people from across the country can be daunting, but Miles managed our every concern, giving us the bandwidth to enjoy the city. 

If you're in Austin, stay with Miles. You'll go home happy, and looking forward to your next trip back."
,,,,,,,,"Miles is truly the best, he arranged a local food truck, helped us stock the kegerator and in EVERY way made our trip a fantastic success.  Most importantly, he is a wonderful owner, very meticulous in keeping his property in the best shape.  We're thinking of visiting another one of his properties next Spring.  "
,,,,,,,,"A+.  My group and I had an awesome experience at the house.  It fit our group perfectly in that we were able to relax, enjoy the place, and most importantly have a great time in Austin.  The house was clean, and was everything that was promised in the listing.  The owner Miles was friendly and hospitable and made sure that we had a great experience.  Would definitely recommend this place for any group coming to Austin."
,,,,,,,,We had a blast! And Miles was an amazing host.
,,,,,,,,"This was by far the best Airbnb experience I have had to date! We were recently in town celebrating a bachelor party with 19 guys. Miles went so far above and beyond our expectations to make our stay enjoyable and comfortable. From running us on multiple errands (we didn't have a rental car) to having a keg ready upon our arrival to ordering a UFC fight for us on a rainy night that we couldn't go out, Miles did everything in his power to ensure our stay was worry free and memorable. The accommodations are awesome and gave a group of our size plenty of room to spread out. The location couldn't have been more convenient to downtown and UT's campus and the bikes on the property gave us an easy way to get around and check out the town. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a large property to contact Miles and book the Airstream Park and House. You will not be disappointed. Thanks for everything Miles. Hope to come back and visit again soon."
,,,,,,,,Really an awesome time. Miles was the perfect host for the perfect large-group getaway weekend in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"The Airstream Park was the perfect place for our party of 10.  It had every amenity we needed, and created a unique experience for our weekend in Austin - which we very much appreciated.  The only thing that surpassed the Airstream Park was Miles himself.  Miles went out of his way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.  Whether it was suggestions for what to do, or helping to pick things up when we didn't have a car; Miles was the perfect host.  I would definitely recommend the Airstream Park to anyone bringing a group to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We just had a bachelor party there of about 18 guys. The property couldn't have been any better for our needs. The house was great, the airstreams were perfect and it was great to have everybody stay in one place. I can't imagine a better situation. The location is close enough to all the action and Miles was a terrific host. I can't recommend the property enough. "
,,,,,,,,Very accommodating on the check-in and out. Miles was responsive when an issue did arise with the toilet that backed up in one of the trailers. Provided nice amenities and were friendly. Did not like when some random guy from the Hummus business in the front of the property decided to take people on a tour around the property one morning. But all in all it was a good experience.  
,,,,,,,,Amazing place! Great attention to detail and very accommodating of our large party.
,,,,,,,,Best ever rental. Most amazing space and hosts. I would recommend this place to anyone. Miles was such a great host. We had a corporate group of about 16 staying there but had a group of about 80 in and out of the house for the week. They let people come and go as they pleased they even offered to get kegs and ice delivered. We threw a big pig roast on the property and it was a perfect location for a cook out. Such a great space for bigger chill groups. 
,,,,,,,,"Miles and Lorrissa were the best hosts!  They were super communicative always going above and beyond in all our interactions.  We had a team of 10 in town for a company meeting/retreat.  The Whitehat Airstream Park and House was the perfect place to get some creative work done during the day and some laid back enjoyable time in the curated space they have created at night.  The location is perfect with lots of food/drink and supply options walk-able in South Austin.  The trailers are super clean and modern and the shaded space around them really makes you feel like you're in your own private space.  The front house is modern, spacious, and has a beautiful kitchen. The 'cave' with its keg beer and modern AV setup was great to hang out in the shaded with the overhead fan. Our hosts brought in a BBQ spread from Lambert's one night and we grilled with the gas grill the other night.  We will absolutely return to stay here again and upon checking out Miles offer a bunch of additional ideas such as a pig roast which our hosts would facilitate for us. Whether you are booking for a corporate group, music festival or bachelor party this is the perfect space, location and host.  Just note that during the week you'll need to move the 'party' up from the cave to the front house/deck area (where you can be as loud as you want!).  Also, you're in South Austin--go out!! :)"
,,,,,,,,"Miles and his team were fantastic!  Since we arrived at the location, he offered up his services, suggested a few places to visit and just made us feel at home.   We were a group of 18 guys for a bachelor party and it was a perfect location.  I highly highly suggest staying there if you're a big group is visiting Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Miles was great and the location exceeded expectations. It is truly in the perfect spot and worked so wonderfully for a bachelorette party! 
,,,,,,,,"We rented the White Hat main house and airstream park for a business event and it was perfect!  Many of the attendees had never been to Austin and this was a wonderful location with a very Austin feel to it.  Miles was available, responsive and so nice.  I can't rate the host and the location highly enough!"
,,,,,,,,"Miles went above and beyond.  From having kegs ready for us to arrive to making sure we had everything we needed, we couldn't have had a better host.  Perfect spot for a bachelor party.  Would recommend Miles and the White Hat to anyone and everyone.   "
,,,,,,,,"This place is absolutely epic - a total oasis right off of South Congress and close to everything you could possibly want to experience in AUS. To be honest though, we didn't even want to leave the property! Miles has created an incredible space for a large group, weekend getaway and it certainly exceeded our expectations ten-fold. Miles and his team were very friendly, understanding, and available for all our questions and needs. They were flexible with check-in and check-out given no one was coming in immediately after which allowed for ease of departures on our last day. The airstreams are a perfect balance of comfort and quirk and the carriage house is the perfect convening space for the larger group if you end up renting the full property. Our favorite space was probably the little ""grotto"" area with the tv and beer on tap. Had we had more time to spend during our stay, we would have taken advantage of this spot even more. A huge thanks to Miles for making our stay a truly memorable one - hope to see you in Austin again soon!"
,,,,,,,,"Miles was available and welcoming.  The lodging was a unique, fun experience and it is in a great location to enjoy SXSW festival.  I highly recommend this property if you have a large group."
,,,,,,,,A group of 20 of us stayed at the Airstream Park for a Bachelor Party.  It was a perfect location for a group of our size.  Miles was extremely accommodating to our group and was always available if we needed anything.  I highly recommend the property for any group who is not afraid to have a good time.  
,,,,,,,,"Miles was by far the best host we've experienced with our Airbnb travel.  He was very helpful with questions many months ahead of time. He was very accommodating to our needs based on our Co-Ed bachelor party weekend. Upon check in we were greeted with cold beer from the beer kegs, homemade hummus and one of the coolest places ever! Our friends couldn't believe their eyes when they showed up. They loved the way everything was set up, the palm trees, lights and patios throughout the airstreams. One morning the guys walked to Ms P's Electric Cock to get breakfast  burritos to-go while the ladies walked to nearby beautiful Lady Bird Lake.  There is also a liquor store within walking distance. I highly suggest this rental for a once in a lifetime experience in one the best cities.  We used Austin Detours for our activities like brew and BBQ, and wine and BBQ tours throughout the weekend, they were great! It wouldn't have been the same without the host Miles for his patience, responsiveness and attention to our needs/requests. "
,,,,,,,,"Myself and a group of 20 guys were in town for a bachelor party we rented both the house and the airstreams. Staying at this property was one of the highlights of the entire weekend. The house is clean, comfortable, and unique. The Airstreams were fun, comfortable and very important to make sure everyone had a comfortable night sleep. Most importantly - Miles was by far one of the best hosts we have ever encountered. He was always available, responsive, and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. Very impressive experience. The property is a hidden gem and in a great area with plenty to walk to and an easy 4-5min Uber or cab. He also had a bunch of bikes available to ride which we took advantage of to make quick trips around Austin. 

Just a fantastic trip rooted in a fantastic property that we were always excited to come back to and enjoy. One more shot out to Miles for being a great host. I couldn't recommend this place enough to big groups."
,,,,,,,,"We rented the Airstream Park and House for a company retreat, and the team loved it. The outdoor fire pit in particular was a big hit, and the location is unbelievable. Miles is incredibly accommodating, and we're already talking about future visits."
,,,,,,,,"Such a fun & amazing location. The house is very nice and the airstreams were extremely comfortable & clean for our crew. We hosted a 2 day meeting and the outside TV/meeting space is perfect for a small group. We also had a chef come in one night and the courtyard was the perfect backdrop for a fun evening. Miles was the best, accommodating to every need and a super nice. genuine guy. Highly recommend this spot & Miles as a top notch host."
,,,,,,,,This is a little piece of paradise in Austin and I can't wait to go back. Miles and his team are awesome. The place is incredibly comfortable and is perfectly located. The airstreams are great and the house is wonderful. Everything about the compound is perfectly decorated and feels like home. Five stars for sure! 
,,,,,,,,"Miles and Liz were kind enough to let us have a small wedding at their place, which turned out to be the perfect spot for us.  Their place is a unique Austin gem tucked away on South Congress, nearby so many things to do.  The pictures truly don't do it justice.  Miles and Liz were extremely welcoming and offered to help wherever they could.  Anytime we needed help or had a question, they were always available.  I would highly recommend their place to friends and family.  "
,,,,,,,,"This property was awesome. Very accurately represented by the description and photos. So creative and unique. Perfect for a large group to hang out in Austin, especially with the central location. Miles was also awesome. He was always around to keep our supplies stocked and to offer some local advice. I was tempted to just ask him to hang out with our group a few times. Id recommend this property to anyone... It's one you will enjoy. "
,,,,,,,,"I was in town with several old college friends for a football game and we stayed at the White Hat. The experience was pretty much perfect. The house is beautiful, clean and very well appointed, the Airstream ""apartments"" were a fun, comfortable and crucial addition to fit our numbers - but Miles, most of all, far exceeded expectations. He was always available, going out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. I can't say enough about how accommodating and generous he was. Also, the property is perfectly located, on South Congress, near several great food, drink and music spots. And bikes are available to ride to the river and elsewhere. It was a great, great trip, and the White Hat - and Miles - were an integral part of that. We would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"I don't even know where to start. Willis was so great! We went to Austin for a bachelorette party over Memorial Day weekend and Willis was more than accommodating. To start, our original home was canceled the week prior to us getting to Austin so we booked his venue last minute and he worked with us on our original budget. I was always able to contact Willis whether it be via airbnb, a call, or text and he was always very quick to reply, even when I had questions about the sound system in the house! The best part was how amazing the house was. We really lucked out. The place was clean, had a huge deck, and was equip with everything we needed. We couldn't have asked for a better host or home for the weekend!"
,,,,,,,,Will is the best.  I don't even know where to get started.  We stayed for my brother's bachelor party and he was a huge help from prior to our arrival to the last day.  I can't wait to come back in the coming years.  This place is a gem.  And the people that run it are some of the nicest people you will meet in your travels.   
,,,,,,,,"In short, an amazing venue with warm, gracious hosts, what more can you ask for.  Will, his father and his girlfriend made our stay in Austin truly special.  

We were in town for a sizable bachelor party of about 20 people and not only did we fit in their Airstreams without issue but Will also made sure that we knew the lay of the land and that all of our needs were taken care of. In addition to the sleeping space in the Airstreams, there was also large and well kept common space for us to hang out in, including a screening area with Apple TV for all of our media needs. 

The property is well located on South Congress with ample restaurants, bars and stores a short walk away.  For anything else, we were a quick Uber ride like Rainey, 6th Street, etc...  

I would recommend this property for anyone looking for a unique venue in Austin which can accommodate a large group with a substantial number of beds and bathrooms. You'll have a unique, comfortable stay and you'll be made to feel like family. "
5303804,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"My family and I had a great time at Lyons property!  We appreciated his availability during our stay, and were happy that everything in the home was as advertised.  We especially enjoyed the steam shower, and availability for the TV to hook up to our streaming accounts so we could watch our favorite shows and movies together.  It was a wonderful place for my family to gather to explore Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This was one of the best air bnb experiences I've ever had. Lyon was so sweet and very helpful with suggestions, and also available when I had a question about the house during our stay. The house itself was beautiful and so wonderfully decorated that it felt like a treat to get to stay there. It seemed very walkable to all the bar/restaurant areas but we went on a chilly weekend and just took cabs; none were more than 15 minutes so it was pretty centrally located! "
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent stay at Lyon's east Austin house.  The house was very comfortable and clean and our group of 7 was very comfortable with the 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms and pullout couches.   Would definitely recommend Lyon's house. "
,,,,,,,,I can't praise this house enough. From the beautiful decor and beds to die for to every mod con; gadget & store cupboard ingredient you would possibly ever use and more. The house is situated in a lovely quiet neighbourhood - unbelievably only a 25 minute stroll to Rainey Street. I would thoroughly recommend this beautiful home to anyone paying Austin a visit. Lyon is an inspiring host with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the area from the best places to eat and drink to the best venues to party. A thoroughly brilliant time was had by all. 
,,,,,,,,Great stay at the Luxe Spa Guesthouse in Austin. Lyon was a fantastic host!
,,,,,,,,Lyon was extremely welcoming and helpful. He knows the area very well and is happy to steer you in the right direction. His place is amazing and really nicely decorated. We really enjoyed staying here and would absolutely consider it on our next trip to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Great location and house is the nicest one on the block. Very comfortably fit 8 of us for a long weekend. We were able to walk to either Rainey or 6th Street and had lots of options for food, coffee  and drinks all nearby. Lyon was super helpful giving us a bunch of recommendations for a variety of activities as well! Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"It was an amazing house and location in Austin. Very clean, well-stocked house with plenty of space. I would definitely go back again. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic home! Everything was immaculate and the home was incredibly well-appointed. A fantastic house for a group or family. Lyon was extremely helpful, accommodating, and easy to reach when we needed. The house is also centrally located and in walking distance to most neighborhoods. I highly recommend it! "
,,,,,,,,"Lyon's guest home was absolutely beautiful. A group of 8 us were in town for ACL and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The house is located just a short drive from downtown, a bike ride to the park and there were great places for local food and coffee shops. The house manual was quite extensive as it was our go to multiple times for transportation, sites and food suggestions. Definitely will contact Lyon again when I'm in town for an event, as well as recommend his guest home to others."
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was an extremely welcoming host and the property is just as it is in the pictures: beautiful. It was perfect for a group of us attending ACL and I would recommend it for anyone staying in Austin. This beautiful property is on a nice, quiet street that is easy to reach by cab or Uber-even during ACL surge, we never paid more than $15 a ride. The rooms are spacious and lovely and the place was sparkling and had every amenity we could have wanted. Everything was perfect and all of our guests agreed we would love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Lyon was great and very accommodating!  I hadn't researched much into East Austin and was excited to find so many interesting bars and restaurants - Lyons recommendations were on point.  I also found it reassuring that Lyon was staying next door even though absolutely nothing went wrong during our stay.  Lyon was also respectful of our space and we enjoyed having drinks on the front porch.  The only thing I will add is that there is another less renovated structure behind the house and at night it can be a little eerie.  The steam function in the shower was a nice touch!
,,,,,,,,"The house is in an ideal location to access the city and could not have been better for our weekend.

Everything was clean and ready to go and Lyon showed me the house and how things work in 5 minutes and we were good to go.

I highly recommend this property and it was great to see a home that looked as good; if not way better in person than it does in the pictures.

The beds and bathrooms in this house are FAR ABOVE your average rent house or hotel room. Usually they have the cheapest things you can get thrown in them - But not this place!

Great beds and awesome bathrooms with the steam shower being an excellent way to recover from a long night out."
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was very hospitable and the house is great. Excellent location and comfortable amenities, just as advertised. My friends and I had a perfect weekend in Austin, in part thanks to our stay at the guesthouse."
,,,,,,,,Lyon was a great host!  The home was lovely and very well stocked.  He provided us with a wealth of information and suggestions about the neighborhood and the city as whole.  The neighborhood was in a residential section of Austin but walking distance from both the Rainey St and East 6th St bar strips.  Overall would stay again here!
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was an excellent host for our group's long weekend in Austin. The house was beautiful, comfortable, and exactly as pictured. It had all the amenities we could have wanted. Lyon was very helpful and organized, and he had lots of great recommendations for the area. The location was perfect: walking distance to Rainey Street, downtown, and plenty of east-side institutions (e.g., the White Horse, Liberty, Cisco's). I definitely would recommend staying here. Thanks for a great weekend, Lyon!"
15220221,,9,10,7,10,10,7,"Great location, restaurants and bars and coffee shops within walking distance. Not too bad of a walk to downtown. Right on a bus line to get you around town if without a car. Freshly cleaned linens and apartment generally clean except for dust along the walls and in corners. Didn't get a chance to try the pool and didn't use kitchen so can't comment on these aspects. Great host. Super responsive and was able to accommodate early check in and late check out. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great location 
2855422,4.5,9,10,10,10,10,9,"Jenny's place has a great location for hoofing it around town. We walked to all the main touristy spots including the 6th street bars/venues, the capitol, South Congress, and Ladybird Lake. 
The flagship Wholefoods is an easy walk so no issues picking up the basics. 
The house itself is clean and comfortable, the only caveat is that it is a bit tilted so until you get used to it, it feels a bit like a funhouse. 
Comfortable bed and Jenny was great at communicating with is. Overall a nice place. "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome spot for a great Austin experience. Plenty of cool food spots within walking distance and just a cheap taxi ride to the middle of downtown. 
Very clean, comfortable and and a relaxing backyard. A home away from home. 
Jenny was an awesome host as well. Informative and well versed in her city. 
Will definitely return when I visit here next. "
,,,,,,,,"Had a great week in Austin and was so glad to stay at Jenny's place in Clarksville. Central, cozy and clean. - this place is perfect for the business or personal traveler. Will stay again."
,,,,,,,,"My second time staying here - it's my go-to in Austin! Thanks again for a great and easy stay, Jenny!"
,,,,,,,,Jenny was really great getting things ready before we arrived. The place was clean and stocked with amenities. A great place near the heart of downtown and easily accessible to many great parts of Austen.
,,,,,,,,"Jenny's place was great, but the best part is her communication and hospitality. I had a hard time getting to Austin and getting around due to a large event, and she helped me figure things out. It's so nice to have a friendly contact in a new city. Her place was very clean and spacious, and I will stay there again for sure when I visit Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Jenny was super communicative and made sure I had all the info I needed while at her place. Super nice! 
,,,,,,,,Jenny was a great host and made sure we had what we needed for our stay and gave some great recommendations for food and other things in the area. 
,,,,,,,," Jenny, you were amazing - and was your communication, but your place needs some work, starting with the front gate, yard. Also, might want to include instructions for the TV (took me a while to figure out) ;-)"
,,,,,,,,"The stay was fantastic. Jenny went out of her way to accommodate us when we arrived, allowed us to come early, and had some great tips for things to do. The location cannot be beaten--very quiet and safe neighborhood within a 5-10 minute walk of all the fun on 6h st. and downtown. A must stay!"
,,,,,,,,What a fantastic location!  This neighborhood is great.  It was a 5 minute walk  to the flagship Whole Foods store and walks to great restaurants(Clark's for happy hour + 24 Diner for breakfast)  plus a liquor store on the corner.  We were here for Austin City Limits.   The driver said it was a 30 minute walk but Ride Austin was so easy to get to the festival that we didn't bother.  The place is cute and basic.  The bed was a double so my friend slept on the sofa though there is an air mattress.   We were not spending a lot of time in the apartment so it suited us just fine.  Jenny was very responsive and let me check in early on arrival.  I would stay again for sure however there is a HUGE construction project directly behind the building.  They work on weekends so if you are planning to sleep past 7:30 it might be difficult.  Lots of heavy machinery and beeping.
,,,,,,,,"Host was easy and pleasant to interact with and was kind to provide wine upon arrival and extra towels upon request.  Location was superb,  as we could ride bikes to Barton Springs and downtown and were close to nice neighborhoods and good coffee shops, etc.  But the construction noise behind was unpleasant, especially starting at 7am on Saturday morning... and it lasted all day which made working while there a bit frustrating.  The bathroom is tiny but the bedroom and closet are good sized and the bed was comfortable.   The home could use a deep cleaning and sprucing up... it definitely has some deferred maintenance, though the kitchen is decent (although we didn't use it much, but for some, this could be a good benefit).   "
,,,,,,,,Jenny was a fantastic host! Very considerate and attentive. The home was lovely and just as described.
,,,,,,,,"This is a great little place in my favorite neighborhood in Austin.  The place is very simple but has the necessary accouterments and is the picture of coziness.  Would definitely stay here again if the need arose for a spot in Austin.

Note: Construction behind the house, sensitive or late sleepers might not be the biggest fans, looks like it will be going on for a while as it looks like a very large project.  Didn't bother me."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was a great host, she left a great list of reccomendations and let us know where everything was upfront. The only inconvenience was the front lawn, which was overgrown and needed to be mowed. Overall, a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,Had a fantastic stay at Jenny's place.  It was clean and comfortable and she was quick to respond to any question. 
,,,,,,,,"Loved my stay here! About a mile away from my office in downtown, but with the comforts of a cute neighborhood. 

Great wifi!
Great communication!
Great house!

If I'm in the Austin area again, I will stay here! "
,,,,,,,,"  We are Canadians living in Mexico, visit Austin regularly. We are seasoned travellers and this is our 19th AirBnb experience. Usually we've had great experiences but when we don't we feel its our obligation to let other people know. This was our second stay at Jennyâ€™s house and unfortunately it didnâ€™t go very well. We like the house; clean, bright and well located. The kitchen isnâ€™t well equipped for people who like to cook. We bought Jenny some wine glasses because there werenâ€™t any.
 We arrived late on  Wednesday night and were awoken by earth-moving equipment, dump trucks and pile drivers that were preparing the lot behind Jenny's home for the construction of 11 homes. The noise was pretty awful, lasting all day, Thursday and Friday. We contemplated leaving but did not want to waste 1 of our 3 days looking for a new place and then moving. So we informed Jenny of the noise problem on Thursday. We told her we wouldnâ€™t have rented if we had known about the construction. She apologized and said she was unaware that construction had started. 
  We wondered how she could not know that this huge project was going on in her backyard? It is her responsibility as a house renter to know these things and pleading ignorance isnâ€™t good enough. Mind you, we also noticed that the food in the fridge (eggs, drinks) and in the cupboard (the chips we had accidentally left) were the same as when we had been there in May so I guess she hasnâ€™t checked the place since then.  She told us we could leave a day early with no penalty. After a flurry of emails she offered us a 15% discount, which we found very low. And, she said, that was on top of the summer discount she affords everybody! We decided we would prefer not to argue and accept her discount graciously, which we did.
  Early Sunday morning, when we were leaving, my husband pulled the chain on the ceiling light and it broke. We let Jenny know and she informed us we would have to pay $75.00 to cover the cost of getting an electrician in to fix the  chain. Funny how it worked out to be exactly the same as the discount  she had extended to us for the construction noise? We also found that you could buy a  new ceiling fan for $30 at home depot, so we found the $75 excessive and inappropriate. We are now in negotiations with AIRBNB to sort this matter out. 
  So, in a nutshell, this place is nice, clean, and well located but if you have any complaints or accidentally break anything small, you will have a lot of headaches and that, to me, isnâ€™t worth it. Sorry that it had to come to this, Jenny. Hope you let people know in your ad that there is construction and offer them a better than 15% discount. That is the right thing to do.
"
,,,,,,,,Jenny was great with making sure we could get into the place ok and was easily reached by phone when needed. The place is in a nice neighborhood and great location for going out in downtown Austin. Close to Mopac so it is also easy to get around the city if needed. It was a great place to stay.
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was great in informing us of everything we needed to know before arriving. She also left a pamphlet of info for our stay and of recommendations for food, shops, and other places of note in the surrounding area. The location itself was beautiful and comfortable. Easy parking and within walking distance to a couple of restaurants and the Austin Graffiti Park. I will definitely be returning here on my next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"A comfortable, tastefully decorated home in a spectacular location. Very short walking distance to breakfast places, restaurants, Whole Foods, Book People, and lots of other shopping. "
,,,,,,,,"My time at the place was amazing. The instructions were clear, and Jenny was an incredibly helpful host. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who stays in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was very accessible throughout the whole stay. She worked quickly to get us in because of an early departure that morning, much appreciated. Jenny also left recommendations for restaurants and other great things to do during our visit.  Walking distance to all the necessities, food, coffee, bars, ice cream, shopping, grocery, etc.  The house is nicely tucked away from traffic on a quiet street. Neighbors are super friendly. Great place to stay for a getaway or business trip.  We would definitely stay here again the next time we are back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Another great stay in this class Austin place.
,,,,,,,,"Jenny's place was perfect for our short weekend get-away!  It's location was wonderful, parking was easy, and the neighborhood was quiet.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Jenny was great to deal with. Contacted me prior to my arrival to discuss details. The place was clean and was everything I expected.
,,,,,,,,"A beautiful apartment. What you see in the pictures is what you get. It's quiet. You can sleep in without a problem. The shower is amazing (and you can find the coolest bath products). The location is fantastic. Everything works perfectly. If you want to cook and stay in, you can. "
,,,,,,,,"Nicely decorated place close to the center of downown austin.  Jenny was also a great communicator. For example, in the confirmation communication, she setup coordinating the arrival process, she checked in regularly to see how things were going and to address any issues. "
,,,,,,,,"Although we didn't get to meet in person, Jenny was a great host and called me before arrival to make sure I could easily get into the listing. She also gave me a referral code to an alternate ride-share app (since Lyft and Uber were no longer operating in Austin) that really saved us for getting around without a car of our own. The neighborhood was quiet and close to downtown and 6th street, and the unit was clean and comfortable with a nice kitchen. "
,,,,,,,,"Jenny has an awesome, spacious enclave nestled in an awesome neighborhood -- everything you could ask for in an authentic Austin experience! Super quiet and comfortable in a rustic contemporary cottage, free from distracting time-wasters (meaning TV), liberating you free to chill/meditate or explore the genteel surroundings of Clarksville."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was a great host! We didn't have any problems during our stay. Jenny's place is in an awesome location- we definitely made the right choice (and for such a great price)! Thanks, Jenny! "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location for my trip! Easy 2 block walk to Clark's for dinner - fabulous! Jenny's space is incredibly clean, bright and welcoming! I slept like a log! Really appreciated Jenny checking in to make sure all was good - will stay here again on my next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Hi, We had a great time at Jenny's lovely house. The bed was very comfortable. The house was very bright. And the location was just perfect. You could walk to many restaurants which was really nice. I think this is our favourite neighbourhood in Austin. We like to cook so we could have used a few more things in the kitchen. Thanks so much."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny's place was really great! Clean, cute, and central to everything we wanted to do. Jenny was super attentive and helpful with making sure we got in alright and that everything was sorted for us. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at Jenny's place! Amazing part of town, cozy bed, very homey feel. Was perfect for my short work trip to Austin! Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location in a historic neighborhood.  Lots of restaurants and bar options in the immediate walking area, and if you venture a little further, you'll reach the downtown fun as well.  Jenny was quick to respond to questions leading up to our trip, which was very much appreciated.  We really enjoyed our stay and would certainly consider staying there again next time we're in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Loved my Austin vacation! Jenny's home was a great representation of the area: hospitable, charming, and picture perfect. The location was ideal. Close to great restaurants, shopping, and trails while tucked away from the noise in a lush green neighborhood. 

Perks: The ability to cook breakfast in the kitchen, (can't get that at a hotel) and the unbelievably comfortable bed. 

Thanks again, Jenny!

"
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was a wonderful host.  Timely responses to texts and e-mails along with an informative welcome letter when we arrived.  She checked in with me before our arrival, on our first morning there, and on our last day.  Though our schedules didn't allow us to meet in person, her personal attention to our needs in this private apartment was exactly what I would expect. 
Her clean, simply appointed, private apartment exceeded my expectations.  The neighborhood is welcoming. Everything an Austin tourist  is in easy walking distance. Expressways to the airport and out of town adventures are easily accessible.  The off street parking is definitely a plus.  Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny's house was incredibly clean and orderly. She left a guide to the house on the coffee table that also included some great local recommendations for shopping and eating out. The house is a 10-15 minute Uber/Lyft ride from anywhere you'd want to explore in Austin, from downtown to SoCo (and the neighborhood in which Jenny's house is located is very cute too). Overall we had a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Another lovely stay in Austin. Thank you Jenny, your sanctuary was a peaceful retreat in a busy, funky city. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Jenny is a thoughtful host who was extremely responsive and accessible during my stay. We were not able to meet in person, due to my delayed flight, but she prepared everything in advance and provided a reference sheet that covered most of my questions.

The space is understated and calm, with an emphasis on pure wood and simple colors, and lots of room to move around and relax. It is a clean and comfortable space, and I slept extremely well.

Coming here for SXSW, I could walk to most (if not all) of the events within 10-20 minutes, But it was also worthwhile to spend time in the neighborhood here. 

There's a lively, casual vibe without being overwhelmed by the downtown atmosphere. The surrounding area is full of convenient amenities and great local spots for eating, shopping, or just hanging out. Local merchants and residents were very friendly and helpful with their insights on how to truly appreciate Austin on a community level.

Overall, this a great place if you're looking for an opportunity to disconnect from technology overload and hectic urban routines, where the city intersects with nature in a distinctive, accessible, and convenient neighborhood filled with history, local charm, and an easygoing pace."
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying in the bottom floor of Jenny's beautiful duplex. Her communication with us beforehand was excellent and we really appreciated her clear list of instructions and recommendations for coffee, food, etc. nearby. The location of her house is ideal with easy walking access to coffee shops, restaurants, stores but the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The duplex had everything we needed and is really pretty inside. "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Jenny's place during the Austin marathon weekend and had a blast. The place was decorated super cute and had a very welcoming feel! 

The location was perfect because it was just a quick Uber ride away from anywhere in the downtown area. "
,,,,,,,,The place was great. It's in a great location and the condo itself was exactly as advertised. Jenny was also great. 
,,,,,,,,"We had the best stay here! Jenny was so lovely to communicate with and checking in and out was so simple. The house was impeccably clean, had everything we needed and the bed was so comfortable it was hard to get out of! The neighborhood is also beautiful, centrally located and in the coolest area of town. We've already recommended this place to friends who are visiting Austin in the coming months. Thank you for your beautiful place Jenny!  "
,,,,,,,,"This place was just absolutely amazing. We had an amazing time in Austin and a big part was because of the convenience of the location. We learned that the West end wear we were located is one of the nicest in Austin. We walked downtown to 6th Street the first day we were there and it was a beautiful walk. There are also very cute store/shops/restaurants right around the corner. Jenny made it easy for us, leaving the proper information, extra information about the area and her favorite spots. She even left us coffee! The bed was absolutely the most comfortable bed I've slept on. We just had a fabulous time and would 100% do it again. Jenny was great to deal with and we met a few of her neighbors who had great things to say about her and were very welcoming."
,,,,,,,,"We had a terrific stay in Jenny's Austin Sanctuary.  The house is located within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and shops. The house itself is beautifully decorated, clean, and comfortable. Jenny was a wonderful host, too -- generous and friendly. We absolutely loved it here! "
,,,,,,,,"Die Ankunft war problemlos und wir hatten den ganzen Aufenthalt Ã¼ber Kontakt mit Jenny. Sie hatte eine gute Mappe vorbereitet mit Informationen Ã¼ber die Wohnung und Tipps Ã¼ber Austin, zum Essen gehen usw. AuÃŸerdem gibt sie jederzeit noch weitere Tipps, sie ist wirklich eine ausgezeichnete Gastgeberin!   
Die Wohnung liegt in einer netten Wohngegend, aber es gibt auch viele tolle Restaurants, Kneipen und Bars um die Ecke bzw. in fuÃŸlÃ¤ufiger Entfernung. Die berÃ¼hmte 6th Street ist nicht weit, sowie ein riesengroÃŸer Whole Foods Market.   
Wir haben uns extrem wohlgefÃ¼hlt! Mein Mann und ich haben schon einige AirBnb-Erfahrungen gemacht und wir haben selten eine so schÃ¶ne und geschmackvoll ausgestattete Wohnung erlebt. Eher reduziert eingerichtet, aber wirklich ganz toll und mit Liebe zum Detail. Und die BÃ¶den! SchÃ¶ne Fliesen in Bad und KÃ¼che und ein ganz toller HolzfuÃŸboden in Wohn- und Schlafzimmer. Eine ganze Wohnung ohne den in den USA leider Ã¼blichen Teppich! Wir waren wirklich im siebten Himmel! Es war auch alles sehr sauber. 
Das einzigste, was ich vielleicht ein wenig vermisst habe, war ein weiterer Spiegel. 
Wir wÃ¼rden definitiv sehr gerne wiederkommen!"
,,,,,,,,"First experience doing Airbnb. Jenny was very attentive and quick to respond by text if I needed anything. All in all, it was a good experience. House was in a nice neighborhood and was very convenient to everything Austin has to offer. Lovely furniture and a great heater if I needed it. Though the house had character because of its age, I felt it could use some simple touches to make it even better. Some work in the bathroom would be a good start with better lighting. But great hot water in the shower! A full length mirror elsewhere would be a nice touch as well. Would definitely stay here again and look forward to seeing the improvements Jenny said she was planning to do in the new year. "
,,,,,,,,"Serene. Sublime. Perfect place, location, and neighborhood. GREAT lighting situation (airbnbs don't always get this right), insane sleep set up (ditto). Seriously, the location can't be beat - walking distance to lots of great restaurants, groceries, trails, and house gawking. Felt safe walking home at night.

I was in Austin working on my dissertation and this quiet, gorgeous, comfortable, well-lit space was the perfect place to hunker down and get some work done. I spent most of my five days at the airbnb inside the house (because I was writing my dissertation) and did not hear much noise from the owner upstairs - what I did hear (occasional creak in the hardwoods) definitely didn't distract me from my work. I only mention this because another reviewer brought it up - it was such a non-issue that I wouldn't have otherwise remembered to bring it up.
"
,,,,,,,,"So like most things, we had a nice start.  Seemed like a great location and the photos looked cool so why not right?

First you should be aware that you do NOT get the entire home, the host lives upstairs!  The walls are paper thin and yes -- we could hear just about everything.  We can only assume the same is true for her.

Also, it seems that the apartment is going through some sort of construction phase because the host kept bringing construction people through the apartment multiple times during our stay.  This is something we recommend you consider if youâ€™re looking to book this apartment.  We did not find it professional and it was inconvenient.

The other issue is laundry room. The host has the outside laundry room locked up and refuses to give the combination to open it.  This means you need to ask for access each time you want to do laundryâ€¦ seems ok right? not in our experience. Sheâ€™sâ€™ either not available to open the room, or when she was, she would lock up the room with our clothes still in the washer.  This would require yet another call and another visit with her to access the room.  At one point she recommended we take our clothes to a laundry service somewhere else.  Really??

For the price youâ€™re paying, we donâ€™t feel this place is worth it.  There are many great AirBnBs in this area, for a lot less and you probably donâ€™t have to deal with the nonsense above. 
"
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay at Jenny's Austin Sanctuary. The apartment is in a great location - near downtown and near Town Lake. Thereâ€™s plenty of space and the apartment is simply but very nicely furnished. The original wood floors are lovely. 
Jenny was very helpful (recommending a great art event that was happening in town) and accommodating. 
I would recommend Austin Sanctuary and I hope to be back myself at some point. 

"
,,,,,,,,"My stay at Jenny's place in Austin was  exceptional.  Her house is perfectly located within walking distance of lady bird lake and Downtown.  It was very neat and tidy, and spacious.  I second the others about the bed, at what hotel do you get a tempurpedic mattress? Overall highly recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was a pleasure to deal with and we liked her place and our time in Austin.  We would defo stay there again if we could.  Pros: great location, the nearby Whole Foods, getting to live among the Texas peeps.  Cons: small bathroom, no toaster or microwave.

We also enjoyed and would recommend seeing a band outside at Stubbs BBQ, brunch on the deck of Perlas, anything and everything at the Odd Duck and a beer at the bar of the Mean Eyed Cat.  Cheers
"
,,,,,,,,"Great little home in a lovely, walkable, safe Austin neighborhood. Jenny was very responsive to messages and gave us some awesome local recommendations. The home size was perfect for a couple. It is an older home, so take that into account when you think about creaky floors, minor imperfections that a new hotel wouldn't have. Overall, a great bang for your buck! "
,,,,,,,,"Jenny's Austin Sanctuary was great! She gave me a quick call the day before our arrival to give me all the necessary information for ""checking in,"" and also because Austin received 10-15 inches of rain the day before our arrival! Luckily all was well the day we arrived. She had a welcome packet with all the pertinent information as well as a few of her favorite places to eat in Austin. She had also picked up some local papers and magazines so we could figure out where to see music and the general happenings while we were visiting. The neighborhood her place is located in, Clarksville, was wonderful. It's within walking distance to so many great places. Whole Foods, Fresa's, Amy's, Z'Teja, Book People, and so many other places. We even walked ourselves down 6th on Halloween night--all the way downtown! It was a super quiet neighborhood and we had no issues walking at night, or with parking, etc. If you find yourself in Austin, you should definitely stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Jenny's place. The apartment was great - tidy, convenient, and very comfortable. Jenny was great, as well - even receiving a package for us a few days before we arrived."
,,,,,,,,Jenny's place was great. It was on a quiet block within in walking distance to all of the downtown sites. She was very communicative and the place was very clean as shown in the pics. I was very happy with my stay and would not hesitate to book here again!
,,,,,,,,An amazing place with a great location. Jenny was extremely helpful. We would love to stay again! 
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was very prompt with returning texts and answered all of my questions thoroughly. The home was very clean and beautiful and good open space. It is in a very neat part of Austin with plenty to walk to for dining, shopping and entertainment. Jenny made a point to come check in on me and see if she could answer any questions. She took her time giving me good directions to the river running trail and more dinner suggestions (than what she already has included in the overview pages left inside the home). Also the bed was very comfortable and climate control was an ease."
,,,,,,,,"The Austin Sanctuary was the perfect place to stay during our tripâ€”the location was great and there was off street parking for our rental car. Jenny met us when we arrived and made sure that we had everything that we needed for our stay. The apartment itself is spacious and contains all of the essentials, including towels and some toiletries. There's a giant Whole Foods nearby for groceries and you can easily walk into the city for more dining/entertainment options. We came to town during the first weekend of Austin City Limits Music Festival, so staying in a hotel would have been nearly triple the price of our stay hereâ€”we were glad that we decided to spend a few nights in this apartment instead."
,,,,,,,,"From Peter (guest):

""Very great location, great host and an amazing tempurpedic bed."""
,,,,,,,,"Jenny greeted me when I arrived and helped make us feel at home.  The unit is stylish and charming.  The neighborhood is great, lots of people walking dogs and relaxing on porches.  Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"We were made to feel very welcome, the apartment was very comfortable and stylishly furnished.  Jenny was kind enough to help us out with a small problem for which we are very grateful.  The neighbourhood is extremely friendly with plenty of good restaurants and bars.  Highlights were visiting The Mean Eyed Cat for Stubb's Bar B Q which is a short walk along 5th Avenue.  We've had a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,Our experience with Jenny and her Austin Sanctuary was very positive. Jenny always responded quickly to communications and we found the apartment comfortable and convenient. It's a short walk to west 6th street and several good places to eat. It's a short drive/taxi to plenty of entertainment. Overall a sweet spot!
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful place, very relaxing, perfect location, and super attentive and accommodating host."
,,,,,,,,"Jenny was extremely organized and welcoming. Although she was away, she gave clear instructions and left a great list of places to explore. The apartment was clean and a pleasant place to unwind in during a very hot week in Austin! The AC was a definite bonus!"
,,,,,,,,"I booked Jenny's unit for my out-of-town cousin and she really enjoyed it. Jenny was very proactive with information and made herself available for any questions or concerns about the rental. Thank you, Jenny."
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay and really enjoyed our trip to Austin. Jenny was terrifically responsive and helpful in suggesting things to do.  It was helpful to have a car.  We look forward to future visits to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"My stay was as calm and easy as I could hope for. Jenny was attentive and quick with answers and information.
Check in went very smooth and all the local information was very much appreciated. The rooms were comfortable and the amenities were all I could have used or needed. There was even fresh coffee on the counter for my early mornings!
I found the neighborhood very quiet. On a tree lined street with plenty of parking was a bonus especially in the Texas heat where walking sometimes could be an adventure to jump from shade to shade.
I cannot recommend this place enough and will stay again when I return to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Staying in Jenny's Austin sanctuary was very nice and full of natural light. The bed was very comfortable. Jenny was welcoming upon our arrival and showed us around. The location was excellent and close to everything. Would recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Jenny's place was great and just as described in the listing and photos. The apartment is well situated to explore Austin - in a nice residential neighborhood but close to downtown. All the main sites are a short and cheap Uber ride away and there are also shops and other amenities within walking distance. Also, it's less than a mile to the trails along the river and only 2 to the amazing Barton Springs Pool! Go for a run and take a dip. Jenny was very responsive and we appreciated the tips on restos, bars, and other things to do. Eat at Odd Duck!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful Place!  Jenny was great.  Bed super comfy.  Nice natural light.
,,,,,,,,"Great space and location. Easy parking. Bed was comfortable, living area and kitchen more than adequate and the desk was a nice touch for work in between meetings and tacos. Jenny was a terrific host who went above and beyond to make sure I was happy. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place in the heart of Clarksville, Austin's best neighborhood. Clean, quiet, great kitchen- loved it. "
,,,,,,,,We loved staying at this apartment! The neighborhood is great and there are a lot of shops and restaurants in walking distance. The apartment was clean and furnished beautifully. Jenny was very helpful and gave us a lot of local suggestions. 
,,,,,,,,"Jenny met us on arrival to make sure we understood how the code/lock worked.  She showed us around the property, pointing out fresh towels and coffee.  We talked a few minutes about what we had in common (quite a bit).  She was delightful."
,,,,,,,,Jenny made us feel very welcome into her beautiful apartment with lots of local recommendations. The apartment was the perfect location to hot foot it about town sampling all the fun bars nearby. The apartment was clean and cosy and much fun had sitting out on the porch drinking beer and wishing we lived here. We'll be back soon. 
,,,,,,,,"Easy check in and great cute clean little house! Cute neighborhood, walking distance to some restaurants/shops and a super close uber or drive to most of the top places to go in Austin! We would definitely stay here again when visiting Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Location, location, location!

Jenny's pad is situated in the most ideal location for an exploratory Austin getaway.  Walkable to Waterloo Records, Clark's Oyster Bar, 24  Diner, a slew of boutique clothing and vintage shops, and the armory-sized Whole Foods flagship store.  It's a 4-5 minute drive to the heart of Austin's music club and hip downtown scene (also walkable in warmer weather).  The apartment is a nice-sized one-bedroom and is exactly as it appears in the photos.  We arrived late after a nightmare travel day of cancelled flights and Jenny greeted us warmly with beer and sparkling water and was quick to respond with whatever we needed (extra towels, for example).  If you're in Austin to spend your days & nights out soaking up its great vibe, food, and music, Jenny's place will provide a conveniently centralized home base. "
,,,,,,,,The Austin Sanctuary is a great apartment in a great location.  Walking distance from downtown and on a very nice block.  the apartment was clean and spacious.  I would definitely stay here again.  Jenny was very nice and easy to get in touch with.
1892065,4,9,9,9,10,9,8,"While the host (3rd party) was accommodating and easy to contact, there were several issues with the condo. Upon arrival, half of the light bulbs were burnt out and the internet was not working. Someone quickly came and fixed these.
For the price, I was expecting more. I opted to stay here for a conference instead of at the Marriott, but for the same price should have went with the Marriott. This place needs some work. Lots of little things. No hot water in the bathroom sink. Leaky faucet. Hardly any cookware (a main reason I chose the Airbnb over hotel). Nothing to bake with. Hot water electric kettle but no cord for it. Iron, but no ironing board. Mattress kept falling through the cheap bamboo slats. Shower is pretty old.

Also, the door code changed before my checkout time and I had to spend 20 minutes on the phone trying to get something to open the door.

That said, the 3rd party rental agency was responsive and easy to get in touch with.

Overall, a decent place in a great location, but needs some improvements to be worth the price."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, neighborhood. Conveniently located with easy walk to restaurants, bars, etc. Beds were comfortable, plenty of blankets and pillows -- though the downstairs bed was supported by slats that shift quite easily and resulted in one of our members waking up to a saggy mattress before readjusting the slats. Overall very clean, though there's no fan in the bathroom and the towel bar had clearly been re-attached to the wall as the previous holes/paint hadn't been fixed. Hot water was turned off under the sink (we assumed for a reason so didn't bother turning it back on). Only had one other minor issue -- we were offered a late check-out and unfortunately the door code changed after the original checkout time (i.e. ""you don't have to leave, but once you do, you're out""). Resulted in us leaving a few minor items and food/drink in the fridge. I would advise packing up before your original checkout time so as not to leave personal items inside by accident. Otherwise, plenty of space for 6 or 7 if you don't mind sleeping 2-3 to a bed! Would definitely stay again, and planning to visit more properties from Erica in the future!"
,,,,,,,,The place was exactly as pictured. We really enjoyed our stay!
,,,,,,,,Great location. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was a perfect place to stay while I was in town for the 2016 Formula 1 race!  Centrally located downtown and an easy walk to all of the fantastic restaurants in Austin.  The condo was easy to find, clean upon arrival, and very comfortable for 3 people.   "
,,,,,,,,"Great little place very central with plenty of towels, linens, pillows, etc. Checkin instructions were really easy to follow"
,,,,,,,,"This property is managed by a third party company, TurnKey Vacation Rentals. While this added an extra layer of work to the rental process, TurnKey was very responsive and helpful. We had an issue with the bathroom during our stay and TurnKey had a plumber in the condo within 2 hours to handle it.

As for the property itself, it is in a GREAT location in downtown Austin. The condo is not in great condition (leaky faucets, somewhat broken sofa bed, generally outdated amenities) and could use some work, but for a 36-hour trip, it was acceptable. I would not recommend here for much more than a weekend."
,,,,,,,,"The Turn key Rental customer service was great. Any questions or concerns I had they answered quickly. They were always very nice and helpful.
The rental was really good. It matched the description that was given and fit our needs perfectly. I would rent from Turn Key again."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location in downtown Austin, I would highly recommend it.  Two things though:  Be sure to ask what your room number is, it is not the same as your parking spot number.  Also, we couldn't get the WIFI to work."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, perfect accommodations for anyone traveling for an event at the convention center. Unit was well stocked. Close to public transportation and within walking distance to a wide assortment of restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,"Really great location since we had a conference across the street at the Convention Center. Unfortunately it wasn't quite as comfortable as my previous Airbnb experiences. There was a broken plate in the cabinet, the shower was dripping, neighbors were pretty loud, etc. But the beds and couch were comfortable. Wifi wasn't reliable. Toilet didn't flush well. The washer/dryer are slow so I was late to check out as my clothes were still wet after over an hour, but the maids were nice while I waited and they tidied up. I'd give it overall 7/10. Customer service is quick to respond, but ideally wouldn't need to call them :/  "
,,,,,,,,"Place had everything it said it would. I think I forgot something there though :(
Thought it was funny that it had an iron but no ironing board. "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location if you're in town for a convention.  Within walking distance of Rainy St and 6th street.  However, the only bathroom is located within the master bedroom which can be awkward in the middle of the night.  Also there is NO WAY that 6 people can stay here comfortably."
,,,,,,,,"The location was perfect however the property was very dirty and didn't accommodate 6 guests as led on in the description. There were only 5 towels and both the sink and tub had problems draining. The sofa bed had crumbs in it and the mattress was completed lopsided. We ended up leaving after the first night and got a hotel but Erica was nice enough to reimburse us the remaining two night minus the fees which pissed me off. She doesn't actually manage the property, Turnkey Rentals does. They had called me to see what the problems were and when I called back, no one answered and when I tried the second time, I waited on hold for about 5 minutes before I just hanging up. It was not a good experience all around to say the least. "
,,,,,,,,"We did not receive any information about our condo number and lock code, however when we called at around 11PM on a Sunday night, their customer service provided that information. This condo is perfectly located across the street to the Hilton & Convention Center. Great walking distance to the Congress bridge and east sixth street. The condo was nice & clean and includes a washer/dryer, hair dryer, flat iron, etc. 

The downsides are that the only bathroom is located in the master bedroom and there is absolutely no WiFi. "
,,,,,,,,"While very basic, this apartment was a great deal and sufficient for what we needed (an affordable place for four 30-year-old adults to stay while in town for a long-weekend -- we didn't need a place we'd want to hang out in, just somewhere we could sleep that was safe, quiet, and with a great location while being less expensive than nice surrounding hotels).  

This apartment appears to not normally be lived-in -- i.e.  I believe it's just used for rentals.  In fact, other friends traveling to Austin the same weekend rented another room from the same host in the same complex.  

There are a lot of things not ideal about this apartment, but you get what you pay for and it is a good deal for the price.  Not ideal things include a toilet that doesn't flush easily, having the only bathroom be part of the bedroom (so people staying on the loft bed and pullout couch have to go through bedroom to get to bathroom), bath towels that left white fuzz/lint on us after drying off, no drain clog so you could lose jewelry or mini toiletries down the shower drain, lacking little amenities like tissues that you might expect, having to empty trash and start laundry for towels before checking out, and three of four light bulbs were out on the light fixture in the bedroom so it was a bit dark.  

Nice things about the apartment included that there was a washer/drier in-unit (we didn't use, but could've been convenient), some art on the walls, and a mirror outside the bathroom in addition to the mirrors in the bathroom (can help when several people are getting ready in the morning!).  Also plenty of outlets and we used key codes to enter/exit the complex and unity so never had to coordinate a key swap which was nice.  The guest gave us complimentary late checkout (12pm instead of 10am) which we were pleasantly surprised by (got an email during our stay about it) however the key code on the door changed around 11:30am so one of us got locked out (luckily one of us was still in the apartment and let them in, but if no one had been home it would've been a problem -- which is actually what happened to our other friend staying in a unit in the same complex, though she called and got it resolved).  All in all, a budget-friendly accommodation to sleep in."
,,,,,,,,"Convenient to the Convention Center is about all I can give this unit.  This was a bare bones unit: no cable, no coffee maker, spotty, practically non-existent wi-fi.  It was a great landing pad as it was 30 seconds from the conference I was attending and I could easily get to and from the hip scenes around Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The location of the condo was great - right downtown and close to restaurants.  There is a transit stop just across the street, and one of the rental bike stations as well.  Close to Lady Bird Lake, too.

It would have been helpful for the listing or welcome material to mention that the unit is on the third floor so it took less time for me to figure out where the unit was."
,,,,,,,,"Well situated condo for conventions, etc. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location for seeing Austin. Explored the river in the mornings. Walkable to 6th St or Rainey St at night. Can walk or a quick taxi ride to South Congress St or the UT campus. The place itself was simple but nice, clean, and with plenty of pillows, blankets, and towels for our group of 6. No complaints from anyone."
,,,,,,,,"It was a pretty rough experience. The condo is in a great location but I would not stay here again. The condo is managed by a large property management company who controls a lot of different properties around Austin and around the country. In my opinion, managing so many different properties makes it difficult to stay on top of the little things that make for a comfortable stay and when things go wrong it takes too long to figure out a solution because the customer service person you are supposed to call doesn't have firsthand knowledge of the individual property. They're just a customer service employee, not an actual property owner like you would communicate with at many of the other places listed on AirBnB.

The TV at the condo does not have cable even though the listing says it does (it has an antenna). Also, the condo's WiFi internet connection is horrible. I am taking the LSAT next month and needed to study and my friend who was staying with me is in med school and he needed to study, but neither of us could study at the condo because the internet connection is so bad.

When we arrived we did not know the unit number of the condo - it was never communicated to us beforehand. We were able to figure it out after multiple calls to customer service. When we finally got into the condo the parking lot gate opener was nowhere to be found so we had to pay for parking at a meter all day long until customer service figured out where the extra parking lot gate openers were located. The following morning our toilet randomly stopped working and overflowed on us. It took all day for a plumber to come by and fix the toilet for us. The plumber said the toilet will likely continue to randomly stop working and overflow until the pipes are replaced because there is so much calcium buildup inside the pipes. The pullout couch bed has a big slant in it so your head is going to be lower than your feet unless you sleep backwards on the bed (which we had to do). On the morning we were scheduled to checkout, we came back from breakfast to find that our door code had stopped working so we were locked out of the condo until customer service was able to provide us with a temporary door code.

If you are going to stay here please understand what you are getting yourself into first. The condo is in a great location but you might be better off renting from an individual property owner somewhere else and not from a large property management company."
,,,,,,,,"The place was great. Super close to the convention center, all sorts of nice restaurants and coffee shops nearby, and the river only a few blocks up for running. The apartment was nice as well. Erica and her team told us everything we needed to know and were helpful when we had any issues. Highly recommended. Only issue is that the only bathroom is off of the master bedroom, so everyone has to go through the bedroom to go to the bathroom."
,,,,,,,,The condo was in a perfect location.  We enjoyed our stay while walking everywhere.  It was very secure with great parking.  The unit was just as advertised.  It was well stocked with amenities and plenty of towels.
,,,,,,,,"This location cannot be beat on your Austin trip. It's really great to have a kitchen too, and it served our needs with our minor microwaving. 

The condo worked for our group of 4 ladies, but I think it'd be a bit tight for a group of 6 as the only bathroom is in the second bedroom.  The other bedroom is actually an upstairs loft that has an open wall to downstairs. 

We were not impressed by the dismal internet Wi-Fi provided. It would not be sufficient to do any work while in the condo. Water pressure wasn't very good, and the shower faucet was dripping. 
 
Management company owning this listing was overly communicative which was redundant to the typical airbnb communication I would expect."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience and based on this place I would be very skeptical to use it again, especially a place run by a property management company that isn't around to see the condition of the property.
My main issue with this place was the cleanliness. Upon arrival we noticed that the air vents in the living room and bathroom along with the bathtub were covered in mold! I called to inform the property management company and they sent someone out to replace one vent and wipe off the other. Unfortunately two of us still got sick on the trip because the problem wasn't rectified properly. After two minutes of walking around the condo here is what we noticed: our feet were black and that the floors were filthy, there was hair on the floor in the bathroom and the bathtub, trash in the bathroom left over from the previous stay, food encrusted on the cabinets in the kitchen, and the sheets smelt like musty cheese. I informed the management company of this and they offered to either comp my cleaning fee or send our cleaners. I asked for cleaners to come because I was staying 5 days and didn't want to stay in a dirty house. The cleaners were supposed to come in the afternoon, instead they showed up at 8am waking us up. I asked them to come back later and they never came back!! My phone broke on the trip so I was unable to reconnect with the property management company to inform them of the issue so we had to stay in a dirty condo for 5 days. The cleaning service they use here is a joke and I would highly recommend them using someone else. 
The other problem we had was that the condo is a lot smaller than the pictures show. It says it accommodates 6 people but one of us had to go get a hotel room bc the pullout couch was slanted in and basically impossible for two people to sleep on. The only bathroom in the condo was located in the master which was very inconvenient for the two people that slept in there because they were woken up every time someone had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. 
With all my issues being said, I will say that the property management company seemed very nice and after I got home they were helpful in trying to rectify the situation by offering to refund the cleaning fee so we will see how that goes. As far as location goes for getting a condo in downtown this place was perfect. You could walk anywhere in downtown Austin in minutes. "
,,,,,,,,"This condo was in a great location to downtown and 6th street. Being able to access the condo without a physical key was also very convenient since we arrived late on a Friday night and at separate times than the rest of our group. The condo itself needed a little bit of work as things were falling apart a bit (the shower knob was broken, drawers were falling off) and there were a few things missing upon arrival (the garage opener, not enough towels) but the staff was extremely quick to respond and was able to come and fix everything - they even brought over a set of brand new shower towels! Overall, the price and the location really can't be beat."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect as described. House was clean and as advertised. Perfect location. Walking distance from 6th street. 

We requested early check in and our request was granted. 

I would rent/book again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, across the street from the convention center. Not really a 2 br, but does have two regular beds and a sofa bed in the living room. Great place to crash after seeing downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Everything ok but the internet connection, it was a general one ( like a hotel), not a private one. The speed was really low."
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood was fine and extremely convenient for the conference my group was attending. The condo was fairly clean and the furniture was comfortable. A light was burnt out in the kitchen and the bed in the master bedroom was much too big for the room. I hit my knee on it several times during my stay. Otherwise the place was very comfortable and the location was excellent. 
,,,,,,,,"Did not meet the host, but the apartment was clean and looked just like the pictures.  The apartment was easy to find and access.  "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent, 5 stars."
,,,,,,,,"Unit was exactly as described and pictured.  It is very centrally located, within a mile of almost anywhere one is likely to want to visit in Austin. Clean and comfortable, and quiet.  I got a call from the host on the day I was arriving just to verify that I had not any problems getting in, etc., which was nice.  Other than slow/spotty wifi coverage, this was a very positive experience and I would happily stay there again, and recommend to others."
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 65 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Great space,  good price, very good customer service.  I plan on staying with Erica on all future trips to Austin. Thanks so much!"
,,,,,,,,The place was as described.  It was clean and centrally located just a few blocks from 6th Street.  The host was easy to communicate with.
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this location and the Host was a pleasure to work with!
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Erica's place for two nights this past weekend during our visit to Austin, and really enjoyed the prime location. One of us had never been to Texas, one hadn't been to Austin in about ten years, another hadn't been in five years, and well I like to think of myself as an Austin-expert (but I'm most definitely not). We loved being walking distance from all the downtown hot spots, including West 6th Steet, the Capitol, South Congress, Rainey Street, etc. Erica's place was clean, tidy and exactly as described in the Airbnb description. The only downside (which really wasn't that bad for two nights only), was the sofa bed. We really wanted three separate beds for the four of us, but the sofa bed really wasn't that comfortable...maybe a better place to stay for four people who don't mind staying in two beds total:) In general, a great place to stay and would definitely stay again if we didn't need to use the sofa bed."
,,,,,,,,"Great service and responsiveness from host Erica.  The condo is in a great, central location so it was perfect for us.  Condo was well stocked with all things we needed.  Only complaint would be that it is smaller than anticipated given the price yet that may be an indication of what to expect for accommodations in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great downtown location.  The condo was as expected, though the pull out sofa bed tilts at an odd angle."
,,,,,,,,Erica was very helpful and professional.  She followed up to make sure we arrived safely and that the condo was to our liking.  The location was excellent and everything worked out perfectly! 
,,,,,,,,"This condo was just what we needed.  A group of us were here for a bachelorette party, and we wanted a place that was close to Sixth Street.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, which really made going out easy!  The condo was very clean and a great place to crash after a night out.  It wasn't the most comfortable -- in particular, the pull out couch doesn't lie flat so sleeping on it is an odd experience -- but we didn't really care since we were here in Austin to have fun, not to sleep.  The host responded very quickly and the instructions for getting in/out were clear and easy.  All in all, I would definitely stay here again the next time I come to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Best location for SXSW!!!  We felt privileged for such a prime location.  Highly recommended.  Good space for 5 people.
,,,,,,,,"Erica was very quick to respond to any of my questions at all times of the day, and I really appreciated that level of service.  Thank you Erica! The place was very comfortable and clean.  It was walking distance to the conference we were attending, a parking spot was included and all amenities (soaps, shampoo, conditioner, towels, hair dryer, dishes etc.) were there.  We were very happy with our stay.  It couldn't have been better!  "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in a great location! They keyless entry was very helpful given that we had multiple people staying there, and it was very close to both the convention center and all the fun that Austin has to offer."
,,,,,,,,"The downtown condo worked out well for our time in Austin.  There were three of us in town for a trade show at the convention center, and the location was ideal.  We had three adults in our party, and the two beds, plus the pullout worked perfectly.  The place was clean and had everything we needed.  The only challenge was the parking spot not being available the first day, however, the team was extremely responsive to our questions and we were able to find other parking options until the spot for this unit became available.  Overall this was a great experience and we would definitely recommend this location."
15804929,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Tamina was incredibly responsive and provided everything I needed to make my stay as comfortable as possible.  The location is right next to so many things!  I enjoyed walking the trail along barton springs, and grabbed some food at the food truck park about a block away!  Their space was perfect for me, and I enjoyed the company of the cats! :)"
,,,,,,,,"Tamina did a good job communicating and answering my questions prior to arrival and was a gracious host. Everything was as expected, no surprises - the space, room and amenities.  Great location close to the park and easy walking distance to city."
12750338,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great location in a great city! Had a wonderful stay and definitely coming back.
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely perfect for us!  Host incredibly helpful and communicative.  Condo in perfect location for water activities, shopping, night life and Trader Joes/Whole Foods.  Host has thought of every detail that one might need or want for their guests.  Gorgeous views and residence with quality furnishings and details.  We simply didn't want to leave!! ..... and we will most likely be back very soon!!"
,,,,,,,,"The host was great!  Excellent communication prior to arrival.  Everything went smoothly.  The location is fantastic and the condo is very comfortable.  I could not recommend this place more.  This is the third time I've used AirBNB in Austin and this was, hands down, the best place I've stayed.  "
,,,,,,,,"Hosts were exceptionally welcoming and continually went out of their way to make us feel welcomed! They were completely and immediately accessible by text, phone, and email. All of our questions were responded to within a very short time and the hosts were able to exceed our every request. I couldn't have been more impressed with the condo - which was STUNNING, as were the amenities - and the location/city! Loved the digital entry. The accommodations were sparkling clean and super comfortable. We had a wonderful stay! Thank you SO MUCH!! :) Will be back soon, for sure."
,,,,,,,,"These hosts are awesome! Communicated with us quickly when we needed assistance. The views were fantastic! Absolutely stunning. This place is in the best location. They gave me a great list of places to check out while I was in town. They have shampoo, conditioner and body wash dispenser all-in-one in the bathroom. How convenient. The bed was suuuuuuuper comfy, way better than any hotel I've been to! Can I just move in?"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful home, great location! Hosts were easy to communicate with. Excellent sunsets/sunrises from the balcony! "
,,,,,,,,"The owner was remote, but very accessible.  The location was very close to grocery stores, restaurants, etc.  A couple of blocks from the bars; but not too close.  Views were great and bed was very comfortable.  I had a slight issue with a breaker, and the owner was all over it.

I would rent it again!    "
,,,,,,,,"Have a stunning place and were super helpful in getting everything organized and tips for around the area/town.

We stayed comfortably with two people, one of us sleeping on the fold out bed in the lounge room (new and very comfortable).

The building was awesome with a great pool and gym. Also in an incredible location to take advantage of downtown, town lake and Zilker park.

Really enjoyed it and will most likely stay again in the future."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience and my first time in Austin and it was wonderful! This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood. It is brand new, secure, clean, uncluttered, with modern decor, two televisions, fireplace, great climate control and contains everything you could possibly need (kitchen supplies, linens, etc.) The hosts were so attentive and helpful in every way. They provided lovely touches and great tips on restaurants, nightlife, and fun things to see and do. They wanted us to have a great stay and love Austin in the process! Their home was so very comfortable with a balcony overlooking the pool and facing west for lovely sunsets and river views. There is a gym in the building and a Trader Joe's downstairs. All the great amenities made everything easy and convenient. We also rented a car and they have a convenient, secure parking spot in the garage only a few floors below. I felt like I was staying at an upscale hotel but with all the added comfort and space of a home. My son will be attending UT Austin and it's an easy, quick drive to campus up West Ave. There is no need to stay closer to the University when you can stay in this lovely home in such a great neighborhood. Everything is right there and easily walkable. With all these positives, the best part was having such wonderful hosts! We stayed four nights and they were attentive to anything we needed in a kind and gracious way. I really can't think of any negative! I'll definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience was absolutely fantastic! The apartment is in a great location, just a few blocks from one end of 6th Ave. The unit itself is very spacious and clean - there's an outdoor pool on in the building which was great to relax in.

Also, my host was great! She was very easy to reach and talk to, and took care of all our needs, from recommendations for food and places to explore, to making sure we had all the supplies we needed for a comfortable stay."
,,,,,,,,Great stay and very courteous hosts! Would stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Visiting Austin was a great experience for my friends and I as we really enjoyed not only the city but the apartment as well. The building is brand new and has a great pool with a panoramic view of the city and river. The apartment is located in an excellent neighborhood with plenty of bars, restaurants and clubs. Thanks for this great experience!"
4756372,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"We had a great time at the Luxe Spa Gem.   The house is beautiful and clean, even better than the pictures and comfortable for 9 guests (we used the pull out and guest house).   The house is stocked with supplies (as well as coffee and light snacks, which was a nice addition), so we did one food order and had everything we needed for the long weekend.    We were able to walk to a few places as well, and our cab rides were short, so the location was nice.   I would highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. Lyon was so nice and left snacks and was very welcoming on arrival. Love the location!
,,,,,,,,"The overall experience was fantastic.  The location, the house had everything we could need.  The host was helpful, then left us alone for our stay.  Could not have been a better experience.  Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 149 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"I recently visited Austin along with a group of eight girls for a bachelorette party. We had a fantastic time and our airbnb stay was a huge contributor to the weekend's success. Lyon was responsive leading up to our trip, and super friendly when we met in person. The home exceeded our expectations. The pictures were extremely accurate. The beds were comfy, the bathrooms and kitchen were clean and (URL HIDDEN) was simply perfect. And, the location was ideal - we hopped around to each of the main districts in the area with ease. 10/10. Thanks Lyon!"
,,,,,,,,Lyon was great! Very helpful and informative and the house was lovely and clean with very clear instructions and helpful information about Austin.
,,,,,,,,"I highly recommend Lyonâ€™s place â€“ communication was very easy and he responded to all requests promptly. 
Lyon met us and gave a lively tour of his fantastic house: it was spotless with incredible dÃ©cor and dishware; a kitchen stocked to support cooking, icemaker, dishwasher, laundry, a welcome tray of snacks---no detail left to chance! The house has wonderful spaces to gather: a lively front porch, secluded back deck and a beautiful living room and dining room.   Lyon offers a detailed house manual with thorough restaurant, travel and touring info. Easy walking to Rainy Street and Downtown-we would love to visit Lyonâ€™s house again!
"
,,,,,,,,To say Lyon and his home were amazing would be a true understatement. This was my first experience with an Airbnb and I could not be more pleased. Everything was better than we had imagined. Lyon was the greatest host and I will recommend this property to any and everyone looking to visit Austin. I will surely be back for another visit :) Thank you Lyon for making our stay in Austin one we will never forget!! 
,,,,,,,,"Our experience was fantastic. We absolutely loved the house and the location - it was prefect for our girls weekend. The house was spotless,  updated, welcoming and clearly had been well taken care of :) We rented the entire main house (for 8 girls) as well as the bungalow in the back (which was prefect for my mom and aunt who also joined us) We especially loved the screened in porch which was perfect for enjoying a glass of wine in the late afternoon. Lyon was a GREAT host was made it clear that he was available for anything we needed. He also provided a list of dinner, brunch and drink recommendations before our trip was extremely helpful. We used this list a lot when making reservations for our weekend. Overall, I would strongly recommend anyone renting this house! If we come back to Austin, we'd definitely rent this again! "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect house in Austin.  We had the entire place and bungalow in the back for 6 people, easily could have done 8.  Its an amazing place just like the photos and the location is awesome, very cool neighborhood and a short walk or uber downtown.  "
,,,,,,,,100% Great property/host. We loved every minute staying here. Lyon made it very easy for us to check in/out and made sure we had everything we needed to have a great stay. The house was very cozy and easily accomadated our large group comfortably. Thanks for the book of recommendations! Highly recomended.
,,,,,,,,What a wonderful host and home! This is my personal second time using Airbnb and some of my friends 3rd and 4th time and hands down this was the best experience. Lyon greeted us at the door and was our personal Yelp guide giving us great places to visit and eat.  He was always available when we needed him. Even late at night when my friend accidently locked us in the sun room which isn't a bad place to be locked out. The house is so welcoming and spacious. We did not feel crowded at all and it was 9 of us. Definitely a must stay if visiting the Austin area. Thank you so much Lyon!!!
,,,,,,,,Lyon was a great host. He was a phone call or text away when needed. Lyons place was top notch - it was like staying at a luxury resort. From the steam showers to the great backyard to the bar area this house and guesthouse were a great fit for our bachelor party of 10. Everything was a short Ã¼ber ride away but still with great restaurants and bars a walking distance away. If we ever come back to Austin we would definitely stay here again. Lyon even went above and beyond our expectations even after we had checked out. Thank you for everything!
,,,,,,,,"Our family (total of 8 people) stayed at Lyon's (main house + bungalow), and we all LOVED it.  The house was so cute and so well appointed, and it was in the perfect location.  Lyon was a great host--he is incredibly knowledgeable about the best restaurants, bars, and activities within walking distance of the house, and he keeps a ""house manual"" with all the details.  We would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon went above and beyond to greet our party and make us all feel welcome.  He provided snacks and tons of information on things to do and places to visit during our stay in Austin and we felt he went well beyond the call of duty to help us navigate the area.  

The property is fantastic.  Large, bright, clean and wonderfully located to walk to ANY number of great restaurants, bars and outdoors spots including the Colorado river which a short 3/4 mile walk and must see.  We were so pleasantly surprised at how accessible on foot everything was including 6th Street and the famous Rainey St. patio bars even though this is considered ""East Austin"".  My group was really happy we stayed here rather than some of the places we looked at--truly a memorable weekend!"

,,,,,,,,Check in was very simple. Very clean and new unit. Will stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place!  Super clean and comfortable with really fast reliable wifi.  Super secure and safe building for women traveling alone.  Gym and pool were so nice too! Tons of weights and brand new treadmils/ellipticals/bikes.  Complimentary coffee/tea in lobby was nice too.  I paid the $10 extra to park in the parking garage, which was well worth it however I had a lot of difficulty driving into the garage. There is a very narrow entry way into the gate, flocked by cement yellow poles.  I had a hard time squeezing around the turn, without brushing my car up against the cement pole.  I drive a small mazda, so if you have a big SUV/truck I would imagine you would have  alot of difficulty. Otherwise was great!"
,,,,,,,,Very clean and so convenient. Right in the heart of Rainey st
,,,,,,,,This place is easy to get to and is always clean. Will for sure tell friends and family 
,,,,,,,,Awesome place
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed Anais's place.  The apt itself was very cozy, and the heater system worked great.  I wish the bed had a thin sheet for me to cover myself with but the comforter sufficed.  Had I stayed for more days I would have asked for one.  The wifi worked well and the netflix on the TV worked great as well.  Anais was very responsive.  I had some issues initially getting into the building (self check-in) so just make sure to communicate with Anais.  Was not a big deal, but just make sure to communicate"
,,,,,,,,Awesome place! Amazing location! I will definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,Anais' place is in a really nice complex right in the heart of Rainey St. There are numerous walkable places to drink and eat right outside. The bed is really comfy and the shower is large and hot. We will definitely look into this place again next time I need to stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Anais's place was great for our two night trip to Austin. Very clean and great location. 
,,,,,,,,"Anais was great communicator , place is in great location, Appt very modern and super clean. 
A few extra items would have helped make it feel a little more cozy.
e.g bedside lamp /hand towels /wine glasses
It is a great place to stay."
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in a nice building. Clean and comfortable!
,,,,,,,,"It's a great place, in a great location. "
,,,,,,,,This location could not be beat! It's right in the heart of Rainey Street surrounded by great bars and restaurants. For as crazy as Rainey Street can be none of the noise could be heard from the apartment. The apartment had everything we could need and was clean and comfortable. Anais was helpful and available when I had questions.
,,,,,,,,"Great location and space, check in was easy. Anais is great at communicating and makes everything easy. The place was very clean, very safe, and very comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"This is actually the second time I have stayed at Anais' luxury studio in the past three weeks. I loved it so much the first time that I flew back to Austin from California to enjoy a few more days here. Anais is so easy to communicate with, her studio is gorgeous and right in the heart of Rainey Street. The view from the roof top can't be beat! There are bikes you can rent ($8 for 24 hours) directly outside Anais' building that you can ride around town or around the Lady Bird trail that is along the Colorado River. All of the fun downtown is within walking distance as well. If you are headed to Austin, I highly recommend staying at Anais' safe, beautiful, and luxury studio!"
,,,,,,,,Host was very attentive and the area is unbeatable.
,,,,,,,,The location of Anais's place was perfect for what I needed. Easy to walk to 6th and Rainey is fun if you just want to stay right at home. It was my first time getting to explore Austin and the place was perfect exactly for that. I would highly recommended and it was an easy process! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, comfortable living space and an extremely attentive host. Exactly what you'd hope for in any listing."
,,,,,,,,"This studio is in the perfect location on Rainey and well within walking distance of 6th. The studio was very clean and the pool and gym are very nice as well. Anais was great about checking up on how everything was and responding to any questions, while still giving plenty of privacy. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a really nice studio where we had a great time! Location is perfect right on Rainey St, and is ~0.5 mile walk to 6th. The building is brand new and had lots of great amenities that I can't imagine not appreciating. Would highly recommend checking out the rooftop deck. Anais is a very quick responder and never took longer than 40 mins to answer back."
,,,,,,,,It is a very clean and new apartment located in Rainey street where you can find many cool restaurants and bars.(it's not directly facing the street so not noisy) Also it's pretty close to the downtown! Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,Very nice studio with all new appliances. Extremely clean and welcoming place! Anais is super responsive and helpful with anything. Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,Tough to beat the location. 
,,,,,,,,Excellent Airbnb location. The previous reviewers have covered the important details and I echo them. 
,,,,,,,,"Anais' apartment on Rainey Street is absolutely fabulous! I was in the bridal party in a wedding at the Four Seasons, and the venue was within walking distance of where we stayed on Austin's well known Rainey St. The view from the rooftop pool is stunning, the apartment and clubhouse were spotless, and Anais responds to any questions you may have within about 3-5 minutes. She was very clear about check-in and check-out procedures and was a very sweet host. Thank you, Anais! Looking forward to staying at your place again! "
,,,,,,,,"The location is awesome.  It's so convenient to Rainey St and is easy access on and off I-35.  The building has free parking on the first floor of the garage, but it isn't guaranteed.  The unit is a simple new studio.  Everything was clean, and it was a great alternative to a hotel.  There is wi-fi, but there is no cable.  The tv is a smart tv though.  We would absolutely stay here again, and recommend it to our friends."
,,,,,,,,"Loved the neighborhood - very close to everything (6th street, restaurants, bars)

Studio was roomy and inviting, but limited on amenities.

Anais was very communicative!"
,,,,,,,,"Anais was very proactive communicating all the details about our stay.  The check in/out procedures were painless.  You can't get a better location than this - right on Rainey street - convienent parking garage, as well.  The building is new and clean.  Overall, I would stay here again in Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our time in this Studio on Rainey Street.  Anais told us everything we needed to know for a painless check-in and check-out, and was very responsive before, during, and after our stay.  The location can't be beat: Rainey Street is a fun and unique spot on its own, but you're also steps from the Convention Center and the middle of downtown.  We also easily biked down to Barton Springs and SoCo.

The Studio itself is modern, clean, and well-furnished.  We felt safe our entire stay and we found the Studio to be perfectly quiet at night.  The property is immaculately maintained, with the highlight being the rooftop pool and its picture-perfect view of the city.  And opting in for the attached garage parking is totally worth it.

We would love to stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay! Anais was so helpful and communicated with me throughout the stay. The room was clean and well taken care of, and the location was awesome. Definitely enjoyed our experience."
,,,,,,,,Awesome place! Super modern and great location!
,,,,,,,,"Place was super close to where I needed to be, despite being near all the Rainey street hustle and bustle it was perfectly quiet. Great view out east for sunrise watching."
,,,,,,,,"Anais' studio is in a great central location that's walkable to a lot of great bars, Franklin and La Barbecue. Even with the loud bars across the street, noise was not a problem at all inside the studio. It was very clean and felt safe and secure. Anais was also very quick and responsive to any of my questions. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Rainey street accommodation was the absolute best!! A wonderful location with the super cool bars, food trucks and cocktails at your front door! 15 min walk to 6th street and all over town. The apartment is AMAZING! Brand new with a rooftop pool!! Best Airbnb I have staying in yet. Anais was such relaxed no fuss host - just what we wanted! We had a small incident with the bed and she offered to have it fixed straight away at 10.30pm!! We moved our time in Rainey street and devastated we could t stay longer! Thank you for having us Anais! :) "

,,,,,,,,"Wow! My collegue and I stayed in Mark's clean, well-maintained,conveniently located condo during SXSWi 2012 and we had an amazing experience.  We were welcomed by a friendly doorman who greeted us and passed off condo keys.  We opened his condo door to find exactly what Mark's airbnb condo pictures show - fresh flowers, a bottle of wine, fresh linens, towels, and a welcome note from Mark (to name a few).  His condo is literally across the street from the state capitol and unbelievably close to DT Austin.  I highly recommend booking with Mark - you will not be disappointed!"
8422925,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Raul is a very easy-going and friendly host!

He gave me detailed transportation instruction prior to arrival. When I told him I'd arrive at midnight so I'd miss the last bus, he pointed me to RideAustin app (a non-profit ride share) and gave me a code for a free first ride.

The location was very central. It's 5 to 10 minute's walk to most downtown spots, and it's not noisy at night!

The bedroom and bathroom were clean. The kitchen, dining room, and living room were very spacious. Wifi was good.

All in all a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Raul and Zac's place! The bedroom and bathroom were clean and had all of the amenities we needed - they even provided towels and shampoo which was a nice addition.  The apartment is in a gated complex so it's pretty well-secured, and Raul provided very detailed and clear instructions before our arrival on how to access the property and what amenities were available. We didn't spend a lot of time in the unit other than sleeping, but we ran into Raul once during our stay and he was very friendly and accommodating.  I'd absolutely recommend this place to others looking to see Austin, especially for the great location downtown - within walking distance of most of the main strips and the Capitol."
,,,,,,,,This Airbnb is in the perfect location for any conferences at the Austin Convention Center. I highly recommend this as an alternative option from hotel room bookings. Raul was a great host and provided detailed instructions for arrival.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay here was great and easy! The location is perfect for exploring a lot of the main areas in Austin. It was also super easy communicating with Raul. Everything was clean and the place is spacious. The only complaint is since it is located in downtown, there was some noise. I'd definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,The details in the welcome message were clear and super helpful. The keyless entry was awesome and really convenient. It was my first stay at an Airbnb and it was a great one. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Our hosts kept to themselves mostly, and we were not in the space except to sleep. Raul did say hello when we did cross paths. However, one of the hosts did come into our room once which made my friend feel uncomfortable. 

The place is downtown and across from Champps (a restaurant and bar), so expect it to be loud on weekend nights. The unit is also right above a main entry gate, so whenever someone comes or goes the gate clangs loudly and you will hear it. Our stay was especially loud because it was the weekend before halloween- unavoidable! 

It was really easy to find the place with the directions from the hosts, and entry/exit was a breeze (as long as no one deadbolts the door, which happened to one of our group). 

The space and rooms were clean, the beds were nice, and the location can't be beat! Other than the host coming in the room when my friend had just finished dressing and someone deadbolting the door locking my friend out, the stay was great. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great and very conveniently located. The room was clean and the beds were REALLY comfortable. It was a little confusing gaining access to the building at first, but Raul responded to messages and let me in very quickly. I actually never saw him after he let me in, so if you want privacy during your trip this is a good place for that."
,,,,,,,,great experience. the location is unreal if you are going to the convention center or going there to drink and eat and explore. walking distance to Rainey street and 6th. only downfall was paying for parking. but it would not stop me from booking again. the place was clean and he was very easy to communicate with and plan. I will stay here again in January of he's still doing this!
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location within walking distance to everything you would want.  The bus to the airport is right across the street as is the convention center.

Raul was great and clearly communicated everything we would need.  Arrival and departure was easy breezy.  Would definitely recommend this spot and stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"This is in a great location in Austin, with plenty of things to do nearby, as well as a short walk from the tram and bicycle docks. The room is comfortable with plenty of space. There is a bar across the street, so it does sometimes get pretty noisy at night, but this didn't bother us much."
,,,,,,,,"This room is a wonderful place for attending the conference at Austin convention center. Raul is a very nice host and he is very easy to communicate with.
"
,,,,,,,,"My daughter and I visited Austin for the first time. Raul's place was a perfect location in downtown to visit the sites. Our paths never crossed with Raul, but our accommodations were very comfortable and we appreciated the security of the condos. We enjoyed the pool on the premises as well."
,,,,,,,,Raul's place is in a fantastic location and the accommodations are great. It is easy to get in/out of the apartment and Raul was super easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a very positive stay! Everything was clean and comfortable. The hosts were responsive, welcoming, and very helpful. The pool (located in the adjacent complex) was lovely as well."
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for me. Specifically for Austin Convention Center visit. Also, the location is quite convenient for enjoying nearby restaurants and shops. All facilities are clean, and working properly. Even there was a desk and chair for work which were not seen in the pictures. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Found this charming gem last minute and Raul and Zac were so gracious enough to let me stay at their cool downtown condo while I visited a friend in Austin. Didn't get meet Zac but met Raul briefly. He is kind and very easy and prompt to communicate with. Their location was perfect since the metro bus from the airport was right across the street from their place. Would definitely love to at their place the next time I visit Austin. 

Thank you so much for being such awesome hosts, Raul and Zac! "
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing location!!!! Zac and Raul make it very convenient to come and go with ease and gave us helpful tips for transportation to and from the airport. 
It was so wonderful to be within walking distance to Downtown Austin and just a short cab ride away from the shops on South Congress Avenue. 
The condo was very cute, clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,Great place and great hosts!
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay for events at the Austin convention center. Raul was a very nice host, felt very welcome."
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful, private-feeling space in great location. Very responsive hosts who gave me great info about travel from the airport (there is a bus that goes right there). Easy to get in and out of the condo with codes to doors. I didn't even see Raul or Zac but they were extremely  responsive."
,,,,,,,,"The location was great, and Raul was easy to communicate with. 
Our only complaint was that the room was pretty dank from the humidity. Combined with the carpeting it was troublesome for someone with asthma. "
,,,,,,,,"I haven't met the hosts, but the place is easy to find, centrally located and quiet, and the room comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"Cool place, close to everything, even to the tourist center. I had amazing time in austin, due to the location of the apt, it was very easy to do all simply by walking.. very recommended!!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place to stay for a long weekend. Can't beat the location! Also, convenient to get to and from the airport, right by the #100 bus, only $1.75."
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I just got back from a fabulous weekend trip to Austin and had the best time staying at Raul's apartment. The location was fantastic and within walking distance to Gordough's Donuts, Gus' Fried Chicken, Cooper's BBQ, Dirty Sixth, Rainey St., the Austin Visitor Center (where a lot of the city's tour companies pick you up for tours), the State Capitol building, etc. It's also just a short (5-10 min) Uber ride right into the South Congress area or west to Mozart's CafÃ©!

The room itself was surprisingly quiet for being so close to downtown and very safe.  The only downside to our stay was the other couple staying in the room next to us had a lot of stuff spread out all over the bathroom counter and floor. But that wasn't Raul's fault. "
,,,,,,,,"The description was accurate and even more comfortable than I expected. The place is just like the photos, clean and organized. It was a perfect stay here for visiting Austin. It suited our needs. Great experience!"
,,,,,,,,It was a great stay! The room was quiet and clean
,,,,,,,,"Clean, comfortable, and close to everything! It was so great being right next to the convention center and 6th street. Remember, this is a shared apartment and bathroom. So, make sure you are nice and know how to share! Our co-guests were great and we all got along just fine. Raul and Zac did everything to make this an easy and comfortable stay. "
,,,,,,,,"What a great location! Only two blocks away from  6th street (the bar area) and still walking distance to the whole foods, state capitol and south congress street. Raul and Zac made their airbnb super accessible and they were very clear with their instructions. Although I didn't get to meet either of them, I really appreciate their timeliness with their responses and professionalism! Thanks guys! "
,,,,,,,,The house was clean and Raul was very helpful. I also really appreciated being able to use the fridge.
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at Raul and Zac's place. The apartment is strategically located in the middle of downtown only a few blocks away from great restaurants, coffee shops and bars. The apartment complex is located in the middle of a vibrant fun area and yet it feels very private and quiet once you are in the unit.

Everything was clean and very well organized inside. Our room was very comfortable and the rest of the place was spacious and great to relax when we were not exploring the city. 

I would definitely recommend staying in this apartment. Raul was very easy to communicate and quick to respond to all our inquires. He even shipped some items we forgot in the room on or way out! 

Thanks Raul and Zac ! "
,,,,,,,,Great host and apartment. Located in a very walkable area of downtown. Raul was quick to respond to questions and helpful.
11440659,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"I cannot say enough good things about my stay! The pics almost don't do it justice. Room is spacious and comfortable, and private bathroom is huge. Host is amazing and welcoming; she greated me with wine and chilli when I arrived and was available throughout my stay if I needed anything. The downtown core really is within walking distance and she had lots of great recommendations for stuff to do. And her little dog is 100% charming! P.S. this is a small thing but important to women; there were lots of towels available for guest use. Perfect!"
,,,,,,,,Had a great time! Place was very clean and with a nice private bathroom. Hosts are very friendly and their dog a big cute plus! Definitely recommended.
,,,,,,,,Our stay was great! The apartment is comfortable spacious and centrally located. The hosts were helpful and accommodating. Awesome stay! I would highly recommend this AirBnB. 
,,,,,,,,The location is great. Super bike friendly and close to downtown. We visited for ACL and road our bikes to the park. Owners are really nice. Inside is very well decorated and pleasant. their little dog is super friendly.
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay! The room is quiet and secluded. One of the best AirBnb stays ever, I recommend it highly. Perfectly located, clean and  such warm and welcoming hosts. "
,,,,,,,,"This was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had with Airbnb!  I've traveled a lot and the service I received was warm, welcoming and on-point.  I've now created a community of friends in Austin that I could call on anytime when traveling through there.  If you could image the loving kindness of your grandmother and that matched the level of service from a stay at the Ritz Carleton, this was it.  :-) "
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful inviting stay. Had a great time. It was nice to know, we had a great relaxing place to go to at the end of a busy day."
,,,,,,,,"I felt right at home immediately with Isabel. The apartment is a cool oasis in from the intense heat of Austin. The bed is lovely and the room and shower spacious. There is a balcony for sitting in cooler months and the pool and exercise room are just what is needed. I didn't take as much advantage of all this as I could have because I was at a conference at the convention center (only a 10 min walk away) and was gone most of the time. While you do have to walk a few blocks under the highway to get to the more trendy bar district, there are also awesome neighboorhood bars to the east that were a bit more my style. Highly recommended "
,,,,,,,,"Great location and great area. Its a stone throw away from all the action. The place itself is welcoming and cozy and perfect for what my girlfriend and I needed. I would definitely come back!

"
,,,,,,,,The stay was an overall great experience. The hosts were very gracious and kind. They were accommodating and helped us out every step of the way. I would highly recommend staying with them. :)
,,,,,,,,"Clean room and welcoming hosts. I slept well during my stay and the bathroom was nice and tidy. Overall, a great experience. "
,,,,,,,,"The bed was super comfy, the room was awesome. The place was walking distance to downtown. Hosts were awesome, even though we were busy seeing the sights and didn't get to mingle with them much. Definitely would stay there again and would recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,"Came to stay for SXSW and it was a prime location, just a short walk away from all of the bars and nightlife downtown, within walking distance of some great food trucks, and the Texas Capitol. My friend and I had minimal use of Ubers/Lyfts during our stay because the apt location is so prime, which definitely saved us some money during our trip. The few times we needed an Uber/Lyft, it was always a couple minutes away at all times of the day.

Nicole and her boyfriend were very accommodating during our entire stay. They were able to arrange for us to check in earlier since our flight landed so early and were also able to hold onto our luggage before checking out while we explored a bit more on our last day before our late flight. The apartment is located in a safe neighborhood, and is kept very clean and cozy. The bathroom is fully stocked up with toiletries, towels, and appliances in case you forget anything during your travels,  and is decorated beautifully.

A plus to staying here is their adorable hypoallergenic shitzu pomeranian puppy! My friend and I loved him.

We would definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,"Nikki was a great host, made sure I had everything I needed but was happy to leave me with my privacy.

Location is great for navigating downtown, everything I needed during my stay was within a 15 minute walk. Perfect for the SXSW festival."
,,,,,,,,"Nicole is great, very easy going, and flexible with my last minute plans.  She emailed and texted often to make sure my arrival and departure was smooth.  Room and bathroom (and the whole apartment) were very clean and comfortable."
4196884,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Brooke's place was clean and comfortable. I hope it's available the next time I need to stay in Austin -- I'd love to stay there again.
,,,,,,,,Great location with park practically across the street. Quiet cottage with great amenities. Clean and well taken care of. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a really nice time at the Clarksville Cottage. We liked the location within walking distance to swanky restaurants and walking distance to Zilker Park. The house was just right for our two young children. We were surprised to find toys as well as the pack n play and high chair made the house perfect so we didn't have to lug so much with us. We enjoyed the screened patio so the boys didn't get too many bug bites. I love the Emerson phone app for all the instructions upon arrival as well as things to do around Austin. The house was adorable, clean, and cozy. Thanks so much Brooke, we'll be back!"
,,,,,,,,"What a find this place is...total gem!  It's in a great neighborhood.  The house was so clean and tidy, super stylish.  Brooke was amazing so work with, would love to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was impeccable, and just as advertised. Everything was communicated clearly before arrival and during my stay. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great experience. Very well organized, close to stores but in a pleasant suburban neighbourhood."
,,,,,,,,Cute house in a very nice area. The house is clean and comfortable. Loved the screened porch. Enjoyed walking around the neighborhood. Restaurants and stores very conveniently located. You will love this house! 
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay at Brooke's cottage. It was exactly as the pics show.... very clean and nicely furnished. Loved the location and close to park area. Would certainly recommend and stay there again!
,,,,,,,,Great rental! We loved the location and the property was a great value. Nice neighborhood in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"The description was accurate, the home very welcoming."
,,,,,,,,"The house is even better than we thought it would be...So clean, cute and cozy! Loved being able to hang out on the covered, screened in porch out back. The bed is very comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed...Loved our stay!!"
,,,,,,,,"Brooke and The Clarksville Cottage is a very professional operation.  Brooke made things easy and the cottage is lovely.  The amenities are top-notched and the space is full of charm, tucked in with other historic properties.  The location was superb and close enough to downtown fun without being too busy.  It was especially nice having coffee, soaps, paper products and toiletries out and available.  Felt just like home!

I would like to stay in this cottage again my next trip!  Hope to have time to relax in the screened porch next time."
,,,,,,,,We absolutely loved our stay at Clarksville Cottage.  Brooke was so helpful and responded to any question that we had.  The photos don't do it justice.  The decor is so lovely and the house was just perfect for a couple or 3 people.  We loved that you could walk to local restaurants and also be only a 10 minute drive from downtown Austin.  We would highly recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,"Quaint and quiet. A little further off 6th than we normally stay, but still less the $8 to get to some of our favorite hangouts. I come to Austin every month and have put this on my favorites list. It's an older home, but has been cleaneed up and remodeled nicely. There was no neighbor noise during our stay, which made evenings on the large screened-in porch quite nice. This property is owned by a business - didn't like that I had to download an app - it's not required but is helpful. Departure time is 11a. A yard maintenance guy showed up one evening and made some noise for about an hour but other than that we enjoyed lots of peace and quiet. Communication is good during business hours, but can be slow in the evenings - though if there is an urgent matter there is a number to call."
,,,,,,,,Lovely location and had everything you would ever need. Super clean and tidy. Really close to very good restaurants and shops. Easy 20-30 minute walk to downtown. Would highly reccomend and look forward to staying again! 
,,,,,,,,"Great place. Extremely cozy, warm, convenient location, easy check in and check out. Every detail is thought through to make it feel like home - plenty of kitchenware and cooking essentials, clean bedding and towels, TV with plenty of channels, fast WiFi. The place was clean and tidy. Very comfortable king size bed, good shower. We loved the porch with BBQ grill and outside furniture. Would be a great place to hang out on a sunny day (we didn't have a chance to use it due to chilly weather but definitely will next time). Brooke was quick to respond (even on late Saturday night when we checked in and had a question re TV she was happy to assist regardless off late hour on the weekend). Thanks Brooke!"
,,,,,,,,"As a former resident of this Austin neighborhood I can say this ""cottage"" is quintessential Clarksville. 

The house is as advertised. Clean, nicely finished, etc. Basically, I would live here.

Property is managed by a management group. Communication prior to arriving was great and access upon arrival was easy. 

I would likely stay here again or at another one of this groups managed properties in the future.

,,,,,,,,"Very good host , made sure to greet me when we got there and let us know the cool spots around the city.  Even went out the way to make sure we were safe driving to out next destination of Colorado because there was a snow storm "
,,,,,,,,Super cool place! Great location! Wonderful stay!
,,,,,,,,Great location! 
,,,,,,,,"Very nice space and comfortable queen size bed. Wet bathroom was interesting and overall enjoyed it. 

Lots of space and good amenities too. Location was great. Street parking was easy to find. 

Recommend more for a solo traveler, someone on business or folks that will spend most time out exploring Austin. The unit is attached to the family's home and they do have an active, young child.

Hosts were easy to work with and it was very clean with a ceiling fan and wall mounted heating/air conditioning unit."
,,,,,,,,"Look no further, a gorgeous place!! In the heart of where you want to be. "
,,,,,,,,"Great spot and very central to all of the amenities of The Domain. Private and comfortable space. Perfect for a solo business traveller. If I'm back in town for any further client gigs, I'd be thrilled to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"The funky converted garage was exactly as advertised.  VERY clean, modern, and cozy with private entrance.  The rain shower was a huge bonus with the nicely decorated tile walls surrounding the shower.  Got a great nights sleep in the super comfortable bed.  Host was excellent at communicating and provided me with a one page house manual that had everything in it that I needed to know after booking.  Would highly recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"Frederick and Maria's were wonderful, gracious hosts. It was my first time here exploring Austin and they gave great suggestions for the area. The room was spacious, comfortable and immaculate. The awesome rainfall shower was great for the rainy days.  The gigantic LG LED TV they had in the room was great in-between trips out into Austin. (We were able to knockout a few episodes of Narcos with the Roku they have in the room) The location of the room couldn't be better. The small town area where the house sits is literally 2-3 minutes from Rainey / 6th St. nightlife. I couldn't have asked for a better first experience using Air BnB. Thanks guys!"
,,,,,,,,This is the coolest garage room ever! It was impeccable and the hosts were very welcoming. 
,,,,,,,,"FANTASTIC ROOM!  Completely updated, but still has a unique, cozy vibe. Great location in East Austin, walking distance to all the cool spots.  Hosts were super duper welcoming.  Wish I could have stayed longer. "
,,,,,,,,The place was super easy to find and in a great location. We were close to so many things! Definitely keep this place in mind if you are heading here for a getaway! 
,,,,,,,,"This place was great and we would definitely stay there again. It was in the area we wanted to stay in, so we were able to bike and walk all over. The room was very clean and comfortable. The host was attentive and helpful! "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place!  Very comfortable, private, and clean. I wish my own apartment had a bathroom as awesome as theirs! The location is superb - plenty to eat and drink within walking distance. There's even a convenience store right across the street with pretty much anything you could need (with an elaborate beer selection as well!)."
,,,,,,,,"This place was great!  It's within walking distance of many places in Cesar Chavez.  My boyfriend and I were able to walk all the way to downtown and back.  Our trip took 3 hours, but we made stops.  Also a few blocks away from 6th Street!  It is worth going to this place for the shower.  We didn't meet Frederick or Maria, but the instructions to get it were very clear. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a wonderful space in a superb location. We couldn't have asked for more in the amenities or set up of the place. We especially loved the rain shower. Would highly recommend staying here! The only note would be that if you're not a very heavy sleeper, then you may want to bring ear plugs since the walls are quite thin. "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent stay with Frederick and Maria.  They were very timely with their communication leading up to my stay and during my stay.  The converted garage was extremely clean, well organized, and beautifully designed.  The bed was very comfortable as well and the bathroom (and rain shower) were amazing.

Location-wise, it couldn't be better.  Overall, it was a wonderful stay and when I'm back in Austin, I'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Loved Fred and Maria's place. Comfortable, clean, and very close to some great East Austin spots. The private entrance is a plus. Terrific hosts who go above and beyond to make you feel welcome."
,,,,,,,,such a great little location and the room is just as described. I enjoyed walking around the area and it's such a convenient location! Frederick and Maria were super accommodating and professional. Will definitely be looking for this place next time I'm back in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"The space is fantastic - the photos don't do it justice. Very comfortable, private and also stylish. Easy instructions to access the property and enter the unit.
We got in late at night and were able to grab some snacks and drinks from a convenience store directly across the street.
Didn't realize Uber wasn't available in Austin but Fred was fantastic and helped recommend alternate ride sharing options (we used 'Fasten' and highly recommend).
We met Maria who was so friendly and their daughter who was gorgeous.
We loved our stay and would happily visit again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great price, great space and a great host. Frederick and Maria make it simple by using a keypad instead of having to meet up for a key exchange which was a huge plus for us. Definitely recommend and will look them up again next time I'm in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Location was perfect, Super close to so many cool spots in Austin! Fred was extremely nice, accommodating and had great suggestions for the area. The place was perfectly clean and was perfect for what we needed while in town.  Just a heads up, the walls to the attached house are very thin and you can hear everything outside as well. (It's a garage after all!) think: dogs, cars, radios, leaf blowers etc. Great location an hosts, just probably just won't be sleeping in. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place! Maria was extremely accomodating and made us feel at home straight away. The unit is a clean, lovely little nest and only a short walk away from Rainy St and all of its locales. Would definitely return!"
,,,,,,,,Had a great one night stay here! Everything was just at shown in pictures and everything worked like it should. Maria was great at sending detailed instructions :) would definitely stay here again and recommend it.

"
,,,,,,,,"Frederick and Maria are such sweet people. There was a slight snafu with checking in, but they handled it promptly and apologetically. They were more than accommodating to any and all needs that we had. Also, the room is awesome! Exactly as described.. Modern, affordable, and really close to Rainy Street! I would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was wonderdul. The room was incredibly comfortable, and Frederick and Maria were very helpful and kind. My boyfriend and I are fairly private people, and we were given plenty of space to enjoy our time together. The only complaint that we have is that there was construction/moving and lawn work that we were not warned about in advance. There wasn't any noise at night, but we were woken up around 8 in the morning on Saturday to something scraping the other side of the wall by our heads. The walls are pretty thin allowing a lot of the noise to come through.

Overall though, we were very happy and would return. The room was clean and comfortable. The AC was awesome, and we had a blast."
,,,,,,,,"Fred and Maria were easy to communicate with - very friendly and responsive with great recommendations for area food. My husband and I spent two nights in their funky garage conversion. It fit our wants and needs - clean, safe, and perfectly located. I'd recommend others stay here."

Their converted garage apartment was eclectic and well done- we thoroughly enjoyed all of the attention to detail, especially the awesome bathroom. The location was perfect for exploring the city. We couldn't have asked for a better experience in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Fred and Maria were excellent hosts. Maria greeted us when we arrived and both were very communicative when we had questions. The room was just like the pictures and perfect for two. The location was fabulous for us, too. It was walking distance from all that East Austin and Rainey Street had to offer. I only wish that we could have stayed longer! "
,,,,,,,,very nice stay at a super good price. this place is very convenient and clean. everything is in great condition. really enjoyed it.
,,,,,,,,We had a great time! Frederick was a great host--the room was just what we needed and the location is close to everything! This was our first AirBNB experience and it was a great one! I would highly recommend staying here--it was great having our own private entrance.

,,,,,,,,"Comfortable place to stay, great price and easy access to downtown. Attached to the main house but has its own private entrance. "
,,,,,,,,Room was exactly as described. Very clean and well appointed. The check in was well planned and Fred provided easy to follow detailed directions. Great location if you are looking to experience local night life and cuisine. 
,,,,,,,,"Austin is a great city, and I don't think I would've had as awesome of an experience if it wasn't for Fred! He was welcoming and always there if we had a question. Not to mention his Airbnb itself was cozy; after a long day of walking or canoeing it felt nice coming back to, and I would recommend Fred to anyone staying in Austin if they wanted a solid stay with an awesome host."
,,,,,,,,"Fred was a wonderful host! He offered great advice for what to see/do. He also kept in touch and made sure we had all our needs met. The rental unit was private, clean, and comfortable. The location was great, close to everything. I definitely plan to visit Fred again! :)"

We took the bikes for an Austin adventure one day and enjoyed discovering a funky coffee shop and supplier 2 blocks away. There were folks staying in the suite above us - the first night they sounded like elephants and the second we couldn't hear them at all! Earplugs seemed to do the trick. Hopefully we will be back, next time for even more adventure."
,,,,,,,,"We had an awesome stay over New Year's weekend! Excellent location -  walking distance to coffee, great food and fun neighborhood bars/live music. As for the space, it has a gorgeous bathroom with beautiful Spanish tiles, super comfy King bed and a great sound system (easy to connect to phone). Daniel was an excellent host - communication was great and he stopped in to meet us and make sure all was good when we checked in. We will definitely be coming back for another stay soon!!"
,,,,,,,,"Daniel's place is beautiful and you can tell he put a love of love into it. Besides having character, it is comfy and has everything you would need for a great stay. The location is ideal as it is right in the heart of East Austin, our favorite. Check-in, check-out was easy. Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,Beautiful house! It was a dream home
,,,,,,,,Very friendly hosts. Great neighborhood. Can walk everywhere. Had a great stay !
,,,,,,,,"This property is perfect for a New Yorker who can't drive! Within walking distance of food, grocery and downtown. Clean, comfortable and safe. Would recommend to everyone! "
,,,,,,,,The hacienda was very clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable. Appreciated the double sinks with plenty of counter space. Hairdryer provided. It was convenient having a microwave and fridge. Keypad on the door is so much more convenient than carrying around keys. Great location for walking. The guidebook they have in the house really is great! So extensive and detailed. Dan allowed us to leave our bags in the laundry room after check out which was a huge help. He and his wife were very friendly and accommodating. Check in and check out were seamless. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,Dan hosts a really great airbnb. It's perfect for a couple visiting Austin. The location could not be better. It's a quiet neighborhood with easy street parking and a short walk to 6th street or Rainey. It was also really nice having bikes to use to explore the city. 
,,,,,,,,Very accommodating host and comfortable place. Great location! 
,,,,,,,,The space it great - everything I needed was available.  I was in town for a conference and it was an easy walk to the convention center.
,,,,,,,,Daniel was a fantastic host and attentive to our needs when needed.  He greeted us on arrival and responded quickly to all of our communication.   The neighborhood cannot be beat it is right in the middle of the hippest part of town and in walking distance to everything.  He included a list of recommended local spots without which we have never found our favorite neighborhood coffee place .    I would not hesitate to stay here again.   
,,,,,,,,"Dan was an amazing host; super friendly and communicative. The hacienda is perfect: well located; super clean; all amenities that you would need. Dan also provides a great guidebook which I found super helpful, it gave great recommendations for restaurants, things to do nearby etc.. I would not hesitate to recommend Dan as a host or his hacienda. Thanks for everything Dan, hope to stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful location, wonderful house, wonderful hosts! "
,,,,,,,,"In a word, fantastic! Comfy studio perfect for relaxing after work, easy to come and go, and quick to head down to 6th Street or anywhere downtown."
,,,,,,,,"Daniel was a great host and was very helpful. Whether it was resturant recommendations or making sure we had everything we need. The location is perfect, it is quiet,  safe and within walking distance of all of Austin's attractions and food destinations.  It was exactly what we needed for our vacation. 10/10 would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,The studio was very nice and clean. Daniel really took the time out to recommend many activities and places to go which was really helpful! We walked to Rainey Street which was convenient and fun. Thanks for having us! 
,,,,,,,,"Awesome place to stay on the East side (the more fun side, IMO) of Austin. Very convenient for getting to all the fun spots in and around downtown Austin and there were some great spots for food, drink, and entertainment within easy walking distance. Hosts had two bikes available for us to use which was the perfect way to get around. 
It is two blocks from the Scoot Inn but you can barely hear anything at night with the AC on. 

Also #coffeesnobs : it is two blocks from the Texas Coffee Traders. It's actually a roaster and machine repair shop but they have a fantastic coffee bar and retail shop in the entry with a patio. Sample all styles of black coffee and get a wonderful Capp. (Not open Sunday's since it's a business mainly and not a coffee shop. ) 

If we come back to Austin, we're definitely saying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying here! The hacienda was beautiful. You could tell the owners out a lot of heart into the design. The convenience was unbeatable. We were easily able to walk to Rainey Street and East 6th. The Capitol was a little bit farther of a walk, but definitely doable. They also put together a great list of recommended things to do, places to eat, and great coffee shops that kept us busy! 
If we return for another Austin visit we will definitely try to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Good, clean space. Excellent, accommodating host who cares that you have an enjoyable stay. "
,,,,,,,,Daniel was super friendly and accommodating.  The space was lovely to stay in and an excellent location to explore Austin -- I literally did walk everywhere.  Some might be worried about this area but I found it very safe.  It's not as well lit as he heart of downtown but I walked home alone each night (as a young single woman) and didn't have an issue.  Overall excellent place to stay!
,,,,,,,,Great studio apartment with everything you could need. Daniel was easy to communicate with and very accommodating. The studio is located in a great area close to downtown and a short step away from some funky shops and food trucks in the East Austin area. Highly recommend this place!!
,,,,,,,,Great neighborhood!  Very friendly hosts!
,,,,,,,,"This place was exactly what my friend and I were looking for in Austin. Clean, safe, and near all the local hotspots. They also had a laundry room we could use. This was super helpful because we were on a roadtrip. Also, we had arrived several hours prior to check-in on the first day. The hosts graciously had the place ready to accommodate for this. We were so grateful for that! Thank you guys!!!"
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I had an amazing vacation in Austin while staying at Daniel's place. He was very accommodating and let us leave our bags with an early checkin since it was ready.The pictures shown is what you see but even better!You can tell that the house was built to be a welcoming home. The details and designs were impressive.The airconditioning was amazing,you can't feel the Austin heat with it. The location was great! Everything was walking distance and area was safe. Daniel had a guide book on recommended places which were useful and good! Whenever we saw Daniel,he was friendly and able to have conversations with him.Overall,this place was amazing! If we do come back to Austin,we'll be sure to stay again at his place."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, awesome host, and very good price. I will come back again."
,,,,,,,,I would recommend staying here to anyone and everyone! We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay while in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Daniel and his wife Anne were very accommodating and incredibly friendly.
,,,,,,,,Very nice house.   Incredible location.
,,,,,,,,"Staying at The Hacienda was an overall great experience. The inside was extremely clean and I could tell how much time and effort Daniel has put into the details of the house. It was only about a 20 minute walk to most places that I wanted to go in Austin, which was a great benefit."
,,,,,,,,"My stay at the Hacienda Studio was excellent. The place is beautiful, clean, and situated in a great neighborhood, with easy access to the whole city, and great bars and restaurants in walking distance. The hosts were amazing. They made me feel right at home, provided me with all the information I needed, and made my trip to Austin the perfect experience. I highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"Daniel's place was awesome! Great location, right in the heart of Austin. Everything was in walking distance, and I would definitely would refer this location to others. Thanks for everything Dan!"
,,,,,,,,"Place is beautiful, clean, peaceful, and spa -like. I would certainly recommend to a friend and stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Pre check-in communication was excellent. The door has an electronic locking system, so no key was required. The GIANT HD tv was AMAZING. For our stay, the bed was across from the tv while the sofa was next to the kitchenette, so we were able to watch from bed. The bed was fantastically comfortable, the perfect firmness without being a rock. The shower is gorgeous and has endless hot water, but be aware the water pressure is very British. There was a binder with notes, rules, and suggestions that was quite helpful so we only had a couple of questions, which Daniel answered promptly. The area may seem dicey if you're not familiar with Austin but it is completely safe and being gentrified into 6-figure homes. It is conveniently located, too. A note if you are traveling gluten free: VIA 313 has the best gluten free deep dish pizza we've ever had. Also the cinnamon rolls at Wild Wood Bakehouse (a 100% gf restaurant) are heavenly."
,,,,,,,,"This little hacienda was absolutely beautiful. It's in great walking distance to many shops, restaurants, and bars. Daniel and his family were very accommodating and welcoming when I arrived and were like that the whole time. Also, their recommendations are great for places to see and do! If you're looking for a great place to stay, this is definitely one to choose!"
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely outstanding! Place was gorgeous and very conveniently located! Daniel provided a bike for me to use the entire weekend! I cycled the city for four days and it was wonderful! He gave great recommendations for food, drinks and entertainment! Communication with Daniel and his wife was very easy and comfortable. I felt like I knew them! I felt safe and welcome! Thank you so much, Daniel!!"
,,,,,,,,"An overall great experience,  thanks to Daniel and his family for the very nice accommodation he has put together!"
,,,,,,,,This is the perfect location to pretty much everywhere in Austin. Nothing was ever to far! Our host were super nice and very accomodating. The room AC was AMAZING. For Texas this is kinda a big deal. We definitely enjoyed our time here. I definitely recommend using the bikes and bike around Lady Bird Lake. Worth it! My absolute favorite thing!
,,,,,,,,The Hacienda was exactly as described and shown in the pictures. It met our needs perfectly and Dan was a great host. I messaged him asking if he had a couple beach towels for us to use at Barton Springs and within 5 minutes he was at the door with towels for us. 
,,,,,,,,"Very hospitable and available hosts if needed, but we also had total privacy. The location can't be beat, we were literally within a mile of everything we wanted to do while in Austin. This was our first Airbnb experience and we were very pleased with everything! "
,,,,,,,,"Dan and his family were very amazing host. They did a great job in building this brand-new amazing studio. It's really close to everything and we found the bikes to be a joy to get around Austin. It far exceeded our expectations as Airbnb guests. My fiancÃ© and I have stated a lot of Airbnb's but this was by far one of the best.
Thanks Dan ! "
,,,,,,,,"A wonderful place to stay. Clean, new and beautiful Hacienda. Good location and wonderful host. Dan and his wife were helpful and friendly. Bikes and snacks were included, and we took advantage of both. Would highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"We stayed here for 4 nights, great location, walking distance to lots of great restaurants, food trucks, bars, coffee shops...

l would stay here again, thanks Dan!"
,,,,,,,,This was a great location and the studio was really large and spacious. Thank goodness they had great AC because without that I'm positive we would have died. The studio was very beautiful and you can tell a lot of detail was put into this place. I enjoyed my stay here in Austin and next time we come back we will definitely make sure to check if this place is available. 
,,,,,,,,"Daniel and his family were so wonderful! I loved staying at the Hacienda, it was walkable to everything and the place was clean and comfy. The bathroom was particularly luxurious! I will definitely stay again when I come back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was absolutely wonderful! The studio was even more beautiful in person! There's a private patio that is equipped with 2 chairs, a huge tv and sound system. The studio was extremely spacious and the bed was super comfortable! The location was perfect for the event we were in town for (RTX) and it was a perfect 15 minute walk to the convention center! There were also sidewalks the whole way. Daniel and his family were lovely! We're considering renting from him again for RTX 2017!!"
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place. Super convenient setup- you can check yourself in and out. Really great location close to downtown. Lots of great information and small details taken care of, not to mention really nice people! I would highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"WOW!!!  This is by far the best Airbnb I have ever stayed at.  Amazingly well put together, high-end finishes that my spouse and I marveled at.  It's really spacious, super clean, and close to everything we love about Austin.  Easy walk to lots of amazing restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and just about all of downtown and the river.  I especially loved our private outdoor courtyard and the awesome bikes that were available to us.  Extremely good value for this luxurious space and proximity to downtown.  "
,,,,,,,,"Daniel and his family made everything possible that we felt comfortable. He always replied fast via Mail or in person to any questions we had. The place is very nice and tidy, really nicely furnished. It's conveniently close to down town, just a 15 min walk or 5 min bike ride. Just around the corner is an awesome coffee place called Texas Coffee Traders. Restaurants and bars are also in very close proximity."
,,,,,,,,The Hacienda Studio was exactly as pictured.  Extremely clean and stocked with the essentials plus some extras like shampoo/conditioner/body wash.  The complimentary bicycles were nice and since everything was so close it got you where need to be in no time.  Minus the hassle of trying to find a parking space. Thank you for providing us a place to retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city.  
,,,,,,,,"The little hacienda was a perfect home base for a few days in Austin. Good size for a couple - big enough to have some space, but small enough to cool down quickly when you come in from the blazing texas summer heat! There are beautiful details - lovely Mexican tile and thoughtful building details - this place was definitely built with love. Great location - super close to so many great east side bars and restaurants - our favorite was a little taco truck 1 block away. We didn't interact much with Daniel, the host, since we had everything we needed but he was always super responsive if we had questions. Highly recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"We came to Austin for my husbands birthday weekend.  We had a great time.  I used to live in Austin and had really never hung out on the east side.  Found some really cool places that Daniel had recommended.  Definitely will be back.  The ONLY thing that was a little concerning was the noise from upstairs.  Wanted to take an afternoon siesta, and it was a little noisy.  May have been addressed because it got quiet!  "
,,,,,,,,"Had an excellent experience at this place and stayed there for 6 nights. The place is R.E.A.L neat and exactly as shown in the pictures. The private patio, spacious room, eloquent furnishing; all make it such an adorable place. You will specially like this if you have a taste for ART :)

The location is convenient and its a 10 minute walk from Convention center.  

Facilities : are all exactly as mentioned by Dan. There is even an electric hob along with the microwave that one can use.

Dan and his family are an excellent host and make you feel comfortable at their lovely place. They provide all the good information that a tourist/business traveler may require. 

Would love to stay here again as well !!"
,,,,,,,,The place was beautiful and convenient. Host was very responsive via messaging. Would definitely stay here again. Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"Booked this space for an employee staying in town for the week. The studio was walking distance to our downtown office. The space was clean, and looks just like the photos. Great place!"
,,,,,,,,"My bride-to-be and I had an amazing Austin trip, and much of that can be attributed to Daniel and The Hacienda Studio. 

First off, The Hacienda Studio is absolutely beautiful - the pictures don't do it justice. A recently finished structure built by Dan himself, and it is fantastic. The AC kept the place like an ice box (in the best possible way), and the small fenced in patio is a nice area to enjoy the outdoors. The location is amazing - very close to East Austin/6th St, and next to some great nightlife.

Dan's hospitality was great. We were greeted upon arrival and he showed us around the place and made himself readily available throughout the trip. He gave us some great local recommendations, which is always nice. The bikes were a huge plus for us! When we let Dan know we were interested them in taking them out, he gave us a map and helped us plot out an awesome bike ride! Dan even shared his home-smoked brisket with us when we came back, which was delicious!

Overall, could not have asked for a better experience, residence, or host. We will definitely try to book the Hacienda again upon our return!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great time in Dan's studio. The studio itself was very comfortable and in an excellent location near downtown.  We took advantage of the bikes that Dan provides which was an excellent way to see Austin.  Was also nice to come back and listen to some music on the Harmon Kardon sound system after being out all day. Dan was an excellent host and even took time to provide us with some great live music venues on our last night in Austin.  Hope to be back soon! 
,,,,,,,,"We had a lovely stay at the Hacienda. It was a fantastic location that is very close to downtown, and in the heart of many excellent restaurants, bars, etc in East Austin. 

The place was very clean and had tip sheets with lots of suggestions on things to do and places to eat. There was a small kitchenette for heating up food, two sinks in the bathroom, and the foldout couch was very comfortable. The hosts were very responsive, friendly and accommodating!"
,,,,,,,,"I can't say enough about how accommodating and kind Dan & his family was during my stay at The Hacienda. They went above and beyond any expectation I had of them as a host.

The accommodations were as advertised, comfortable and very clean. Being able to borrow a bike was a huge feature that I appreciated. 

Thanks for being an awesome hosts and hope I can stay at The Hacienda again if/when my travels take me back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The studio is a lovely place. Dan and his family make you feel at home. They're available when I had questions and were very nice to help me out every time I needed it. The convention center is not far from the studio, just about 15 mins by foot. I sometimes walked or took a bus, as cabs are more available in downtown. I definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants to enjoy Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The studio was beautifully finished and impeccably clean, we loved the basins in the bathroom. We met Daniel a couple of times whilst we were coming or going, he was very friendly and helpful. My wife and I both loved Austin, the studio is only about a 10 minute walk from 6th Street and Ranier Street where there are some great bars and places to eat."
,,,,,,,,"Five Star Place!! Very clean and classy!!
Id stay here again in a heart (URL HIDDEN) the heart of it all and very nice owner.
 I had a very late arrival, asked for a late check out, and over slept, the owner was very gracious. 
Very nice place full of class, In the heart of everything!!
I give a thumbs up & five stars. Not to mention awesome value!!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed a week while here for work. The space is *really* nice, clean, and comfortable. It's a great location, walkable to the convention center is super nice. The owner was friendly and responsive and well organized. It was really perfect for what I needed."
,,,,,,,,Daniel and his wife were amazing hosts!!!  We could not have been happier with our stay.  They were a wealth of knowledge about Austin and always had fun ideas for us.  The space was beautiful and well equipped.  The bikes were a huge bonus and we even got a coffee delivery right to our door!  The place was centrally located we could walk or bike everywhere!   I definitely recommend it!
,,,,,,,,"Daniel was very welcoming and we loved the apartment.  It was exactly the space we needed for the weekend and perfect location; close to restaurants and bars.  Unfortunately, it rained most of our time there, but the available bikes would have just topped off our stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This is the best Airbnb I have stayed at so far! The unit was gorgeous and clean and perfectly located! Everything was within walking distance. The host and his family were welcoming, friendly and gave us great info on local restaurants. We will definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,"Dan was very communicative and a great host. The apt was great, as described, in a really convenient neighborhood, and quite comfortable. I stayed while on business but would stay for vacation as well."
,,,,,,,,I loved my stay at the Hacienda Studio. Dan was an amazing host and really made me feel at home. He gave great advice on what to do in and around Austin and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The apartment was extremely nice and comfortable. The location can't be beat. I was able to walk everywhere with no problem. Thanks Dan!
,,,,,,,,Amazing location!!!! Suite was beautifully done and host was super nice!!! Will definitely be back!!!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay here and we loved being their first guests in their newly constructed place! We loved the privacy it provided while having the convenience of the host being a few steps away. The place had everything we needed: small kitchenette, iron and ironing board, towels and shower toiletries, mini fridge, small private backyard, Bluetooth speakers and even a washer and dryer (detergent provided). We especially loved the 2 brand new bikes (with locks and helmets) that they provided for us. The quiet neighborhood was close enough to walk to the main downtown area. 

Thank you to Dan and his family for making us feel so welcome in their home and in Austin! Would highly recommend this place without any hesitation. "
2515481,4,8,9,9,9,9,8,Great place for the price
,,,,,,,,Clean home in a great location for very reasonable price. 
,,,,,,,,"Very nice place to stay if you need just a place to sleep while you explore Austin. Great location, very close to a lot of fun places! The room was clean and described accurately. Lots of parking too! "
,,,,,,,,This Accomodation is very basic but there were still some issues. The room was very small especially with two people staying in it. The bathroom was rather dirty as you share it with the other guests. During our stay the electricity in our room went off and when we contacted guesty their communication wasn't great. We had to wait till the next morning to get it fixed. All in all we were quite disappointed with our stay. The location is however close to downtown but it is in quite a run down area.
,,,,,,,,"Our trip to Austin was severely dampened by our Airbnb experience in this home. The freezing room/floor, the black mold and dripping ceiling in your bathroom, and the bugs we found present in our bed were enough to make us very grateful we only had to stay one night. We've stayed in a variety of Airbnb's, but this one we really cannot recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location. East Austin is a great neighborhood!"
,,,,,,,,Good location and value for money 
,,,,,,,,Very basic accommodations. Worked well for our purposes: a quick overnight stay to check out Austin.
,,,,,,,,"This property is strongly misrepresented. Before staying, be aware that it is a very old house with no insulation or seals (such as under the door), three bedrooms, ceilings about 6'6"" tall, and only one shared bathroom. It is very much like a hostel. There are likely better places to stay in the area for less. "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location and good value for money. It's really perfect to explore East Austin and Downtown. If all you need is a room (why stay inside if you're seeing a new city, right?) then this is the perfect place. "
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay...the house was cute, clean, in a great location and had all of the amenities I needed. The rooms were small but there was shelving and a clothes rack that I most certainly used while I was there. The value was great considering how easy it was to get around Austin. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend them to friends and family."
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,Awesome location. Perfect for those looking to explore Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Quiet and small location. Easy for quick in and out nights
,,,,,,,,"Muy buena situaciÃ³n para ir al centro. Cerca del Lady Bird lake tambiÃ©n. Apenas a 1 min de la N35. Tiene un Cafe Bar excepcional muy cerca: Cenote, Sobre toso para desayunar y cenar. EstÃ¡ en la Calle CÃ©sar SÃ¡nchez, perpendicular con Navasota, tb recomendada."
,,,,,,,,Very cozy space. The location is perfect. Check in and check out is easy. You're super close to the best taco truck in Austin and to bars. Everything you need for your stay in Austin at this place. 
,,,,,,,,A nice clean space in a quiet neighborhood. Plan to share the place with other BnBers but we had the house to ourselves. Centrally located but not in a busy area.
,,,,,,,,"Good location and walkable to downtown. Small rooms and only one bathroom for potential 3 rooms and a trailer. But plenty of amenities and communal space. Kitchen had some strange smells and ant issues but if I had wanted to buy groceries and cool, appliances were fine. "
,,,,,,,,"It's a nice little share house in a convenient part of town. The hosts were very nice and helpful. Over all I thought it was priced a little on the high side for having to share a bathroom but everything else was exactly what you want from a stay. 

Thanks.  "
,,,,,,,,"Disappointed with my stay here. The headline for the listing was 'Quiet Chic' and this is what made the listing appealing to me since I was travelling for work for a week. 

The description did not give an impression that you would be sharing the place with two other rooms of other AirBnb guests and not the 'Quiet and Chic' couple pictured in the listing. I was unfortunate in that the other AirBnb guests were loud past 1:00 am on 3 of the 5 weeknights during my stay leading to poor and short night's sleep.

When I reached out to the hosts about this issue, they referred me to the person that actually manages their listing Tom. Tom was unable to resolve the issue and was not quick in responding back to concerns.

As far as the place itself, the room is tight in space and a little bit stuffy with the Texas humidity and lack of ventilation. The room is pretty much as pictured, but be aware that what is pictured is exactly all there is and there is not much room to walk around the bed and the ceilings are pretty low.

Finally, the direct neighborhood surroundings lacked food options. The cluster of Yelp restaurants for 'quick meal' does not begin until about either 1.5 mi North or Northwest. I am an avid walker and biker so this would not usually be an issue, but be aware that a major freeway overpass to the nearby west does act as a big divider between the Austin areas."
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, comfortable bed. Any questions I had were answered promptly."
,,,,,,,,"The description was accurate. The only difference is that the neighborhood and room was just visually less welcoming than I had expected. I didn't have any issues, the communication was perfect and the price was phenomenal (I really don't think it can be beat)!"
,,,,,,,,Great location! The place is quiet and met my basic needs. Only one bathroom and three rooms plus any guests staying in the airstream. 
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Chris & Loni's. The room is exactly what you expect from the description and pictures, and it's in a perfect location. Thanks for everything!"
,,,,,,,,Chris and Loni were awesome about communicating check in times and departure times. They even let us leave our luggage in the living room after check out because we had a later flight! 
,,,,,,,,"Our experience was maddening. 
Toilet was broken would not flush; full of urine.
Shower head was spraying water up the ceiling traveling across the room onto and down a non-tiled wall clearly damaging the wall. 
We had less than 24 hours to get in and out of Austin to fulfill my travel purpose (not ACL) so calling for maintenance was past the point  
House had 3 rooms to 1 bathroom which may have been not too big of a deal but THEN there was an Airstream unit in the backyard which really put the strain on bathroom sharing. 
I can appreciate and understand the business of buying houses solely to flip for airbnb profit but I can't get on with ripping people off with a poorly taken care of place. The house was clearly furnished with the bare minimum effort and the photos were not at all representative at all of what I stayed in. We felt completely like just another dollar. I would feel unsure of my post if I hadn't experienced airbnb before but I've stayed in quite a few other places to have a realistic gauge for this situation.  
Would not recommend the Austin location. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Sorry, but hoped for something better, you get what you pay for. It was clean and presentable but there was an odor of mold, urine (not sure). There was uneven doors, cracks, mold, the air conditioner barely kept the room cool bugs coming through the vent were biting through the night. The rooms were very very small - with horrible light fixture, we only received two towels between two people. We didn't like the sharing of the bathroom (my fault for not looking into that more better but I don't think it was explained very well in the description), felt awkward for sharing the whole house and didn't feel relaxed to be there with strangers.  I don't think the location was all great (a little run down) homeless side of town. So if you are looking for a place TO JUST CRASH and cheap this is the place for you ---- but we'll be looking else where next time."
,,,,,,,,"The stay was really nice, the price was reasonable, and the location was great. Overall it's a good place to stay a couple of night and it's close enough to see and do some adventure down in austin."
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood was walking distance from my conference and tasty food at Cenote. I had all the info I needed for keyless entry to the house and room ahead of time and was able to get an extra towel when I needed it.
,,,,,,,,"The room much smaller than we expected but the bed was comfortable enough. The bathroom is shared between the three different bedrooms, all of which seemed to be rented out to other groups of guests. Locks on bedroom door to keep your stuff secure while you're gone. Good area and walkable to many things. If you aren't looking for frills or luxury, this is a budget friendly bet."
,,,,,,,,Great spot! A must if you're going to the convention center.
,,,,,,,,Cute place and great location!
,,,,,,,,"Meine Freundin und ich haben Ã¼bers Wochenende in diesem Apartment gelebt und hatten eine tolle Zeit. Das Apartment war gerÃ¤umig und sauber. Der Standort ist nicht allzu weit von der Downtown entfernt. Am Besten gelangt man in die Stadt indem man lÃ¤uft oder die App ""Getme"" benutzt. ""Uber"" und ""Lyft"" sind in Austin jedoch nicht verfÃ¼gbar. AuÃŸerdem war es toll mit anderen Airbnber in einem Apartment zu sein, um dadurch neue Kontakte knÃ¼pfen zu kÃ¶nnen. 
Auch die Kommunikationen zwischen den Vermietern verlief reibungslos. Wir wÃ¼rden jederzeit wieder kommen. 
"
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I booked this place because it was cheap(ish) and in a good location, but I wish we would have paid more for a nicer place. 

The room we stayed in was tiny with very low ceilings and was somewhat dingy.  There were spaces under the front and back door to the house that were broken so you could see outside, which I think may of contributed to the bug situation. There was an AC unit that was not installed properly, so bugs could get in on the sides, which sucked because I was getting eating alive INSIDE.. and there were a few spider encounters, but I handled them. 

Although the hosts are nice, they could have done a better job at providing essentials, such as hand towels for the bathroom and even toilet paper at one point. 2 of us stayed for 3 nights and were only provided 2 bath towels, which just wasn't enough given it was 90+ degrees while we were there so we were showering often.

We also did not know that there would be other people renting the other rooms while we were there. This made us a bit uncomfortable since we didn't know who was sleeping in the rooms next to us. 

All in all, if you are just trying to get by for a night or 2 go for it, but personally, I will not be returning to this Airbnb."
,,,,,,,,"The room is a very good value, but you get what you pay for. 

For a place to sleep, shower, and keep your things, the place did it's job and we were able to put more of our money toward experiencing all the great things Austin has to offer. The location was fantastic and it's just a ten minute walk from Rainey St. 

Chris and Loni seemed very nice from their communication and were very attentive. We never got a chance to meet them, as they don't actually live in the house. The room in the house is shared with two other Airbnb rooms with a shared bathroom, which was not very clear from the posting. The place was older but clean, and had AC units throughout it (except for the bathroom). 

Overall, I appreciate the good value the place provided, but I'll be staying somewhere else next time I visit Austin. For anyone looking for a good deal, this place is perfect for a budget Austin trip. Just don't expect a luxurious experience."
,,,,,,,,"Didn't meet anyone else during our stay, but it was in a great location near Rainey St and had a Toy Museum down the road (if you had any figurines growing up as an 80s/90s kid, you'll be in for a treat!)
Easy access with door code, and full kitchen availability. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for what we needed; a place to sleep between days of exploring Austin. The room was very small as is shown in the photo, the memory foam mattress was very nice, and the window unit AC in the room was essential. 

The location of the house is fantastic, we walked to the Blue Cat Cafe, Bufalina Pizza, and the White Horse to go dancing. Definitely would stay in this area of Austin again. 

One thing to note that is not clear from the listing is that Chris and Loni do not live in the house. All three bedrooms are separate listings on Airbnb, and they are operated by an outside company. We think that the personality of a home and advantage of having locals to talk to is one of the best parts of Airbnb and therefore would probably not stay at this particular listing again. 

The bathroom certainly could have used a fan or even its own AC unit. Even though it was summertime and Texas does get humid, the bathroom and the house overall was stuffy and damp. 

Another odd thing was the kitchen, it was fully stocked with pots and pans but there were almost no dishes to eat off of. There were two coffee cups and one wine glass, but no water glasses. In order for the kitchen to be usable is must be restocked appropriately. We ate out for every meal. 

The common area/living room was nice, but interaction with the other guests was a little awkward because of the nature of the booking. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Disappointing overall. The pictures are misleading. There's no central air, just window units in the rooms. Shared bathroom was not as clean as in photos. The living room and kitchen are dark and dingy. "
,,,,,,,,"We left after one night here, even though we'd paid for two. The photos are deceptive. In the ad everything looks new, clean and bright. The reality was that the common area of the house was dark, run-down and smelly. The pictures represent the actual items in the house, but the ambiance is totally different in person. The very back of the house, where this bedroom and the bathroom are located, smelled like urine.

The bedroom was small, which was represented fairly in the photos and not a problem for us. The real problem was the incredible humidity that the noisy window unit wouldn't remedy at all. We were shivering and sweating all night. Our clothes and shoes got wet in the rain and wouldn't dry even 24 hours later after being in this room. There were mosquitoes in the room that we guessed had come in where the crack for the window unit was.

The bathroom wasn't so bad overall, but it smelled like pee and the humidity kept the dust and hair sticking on everything. We didn't take a shower there.

Looking back, maybe we shouldn't have trusted a host that doesn't necessarily live in the area and outsources any in-person communication to another person not listed in the ad. It doesn't seem like a place that is personally looked after at all, just an old, run-down house where people pass through."
,,,,,,,,It was just what we needed
,,,,,,,,"While it felt the room was a bit smaller than depicted in the photo, the home was in the perfect location, bed was comfortable, and climate control (window unit) was adequate in the bedroom. (No climate control in the bathroom lead to a rather humid/uncomfortable grooming experience on the hotter days. We just took cold showers to compensate). Towels were provided but no washcloths. There was no ice or cups to drink from: we had to provide these ourselves. However, overall for the value I would stay here again keeping in mind the things I would need to provide for myself. "
,,,,,,,,"Great, easy place to stay! Awesome location and so easy to get to and access. "
,,,,,,,,"I'm a repeat guest because I like the location, cleanliness and accessibility. Wifi is working this time! So , hosts are really taking feedback seriously. Will stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"I was only staying for a night in Austin. The value of this room was incredible. I accessed the house and my room very easily. Right next door is the Blue Cat Cafe where I went to unwind and pet some kitties while drinking a decaf, herbal iced tea before going to bed. The room was simple but comfortable. I didn't take advantage of the common area, but walked a couple of blocks to a breakfast place for a nice coffee and breakfast. I really love Austin for its quirkiness, and this place was exactly what I needed."
,,,,,,,,This place was good. 
,,,,,,,,"Great price for a great place to stay. Communication was excellent. Location was east to find and easy to access. I did not see the host in person, but I saw the other guest. Extremely comfortable bed. A/C was excellent and needed while I was in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Place as described. Great location! The bed was amazing, slept like a baby. We stay again when in town."
,,,,,,,,Great spot - would definately go back again.
,,,,,,,,"Awesome experience! The neatest Airbnb place I've ever been to, quaint but cozy. I had  a huge and comfortable bed, soft pillows and fresh towels. Kitchen and bathroom were squeaky clean. Great location as well. Will definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Listing was accurate. The neighborhood was great, lots of interesting places nearby and centrally located close to numerous attractions. Hosts were pleasant and easy to work with."
,,,,,,,,Really good location and nice facilities. The AC was so nice to have in awesome and hit Austin!
,,,,,,,,Very clean!
,,,,,,,,Fast response to comments! Very nice people. 
,,,,,,,,I had zero interaction with the hosts but I was able to have a very independent experience - no keys had to be exchanged as they have codes to open the doors - the only negative is the fact of only having one bathroom but it was not bad at all. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a clean bright spot, about 5 blocks from the main downtown area past the freeway overhead and right next to a Cat Cafe! The place was small  with a shared bathroom and kitchenette, but with all the basics anyone would need. Plus, in the hot hot Austin mid-summer, it was nice to have that air conditioning/fan option. The entry doorknob was a little tricky, but the host responded promptly to my text.  My advice would be to make sure to give a strong jerk turn right after the lock unleashes.  Other than that, it fit perfectly and economically into what I needed."
,,,,,,,,This place is great! Walking distance to downtown and cozy. Not much more I could ask for.
,,,,,,,,Yeah it was a nice room. Love the AC blasting cold. To get a hold of the owner is hard. Especially when u want your refund & they make it hard to get any type of communication 
,,,,,,,,"It is a great neighborhood everyone was really nice. The only thing I didn't like was there was not a TV. Great place ,time and location.."
,,,,,,,,Nice house close to downtown. Nice neighborhood too.
,,,,,,,,Second time staying at this Airbnb and it was great for my quick trip to Austin. The location is convenient.  
,,,,,,,,"I showed up at 6 PM (check-in was 3) and there was someone still occupying my assigned room. I had to call a third party property manager, rather than the host to discuss the issue. As english was not the third party's first language, I had trouble conveying the nature of my issue. I talked to the late guest, he collected his things and left, and I changed the sheets out myself. The third party property manager had told me she would call back in 10 minutes, but instead the host showed up 30 minutes later, after I had settled in and offered to send the cleaning service. I declined because I had settled in and done the work so I didn't want any more hassle.  After I requested compensation for the hassle, the host seemed very hesitant, but refunded me $9 (15% of the rate). That was less than the $10 cleaning fee that he clearly hadn't spent on my room that day. To top it off, he sent me a generic e-mail after my stay asking for a 5-star rating. The location and house were good and fit my expectations, but the host seems more concerned about quantity of guests over quality of the stay. I won't stay with this host again."
,,,,,,,,great host. cozy location! very fun exoerience.
,,,,,,,,My first airbnb experience and i'll definitely be back! I only stayed one night but this would be even better for a longer stay. Didn't get to meet them but they were nice on the phone!
,,,,,,,,I normally don't leave bad reviews but this place deserves one. The shower wasn't functioning and the owner thought it would be ok to leave a note telling guests to shower in another building. I would not stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Clean, small close to a number of shops and restaurants on Rainey street"
,,,,,,,,The room was as expected.  Clean and ready to go.  Towels were provided and the instructions were great.
,,,,,,,,"The description is misleading. The house is by no means ""new."" There are massive cracks in the bathtub that were covered up with a weird, gross, squishy blue mat, and the ""Operating License"" from the City of Austin that is posted on the fridge is EXPIRED. The host does not live in this house. The house has three bedrooms that all get rented out through airbnb and they all share one bathroom (at one point there were six of us sharing the one bathroom). This is much more of a hostel than a BNB. The neighborhood made me pretty nervous (my girl friend and I would not walk outside at night, we took taxis several times). Also, the key-less entry was not explained very well. There was a code given, but then I was told to ""Simply open the door"" when I was having trouble getting in, not informed at all that there is a specific timing and direction you have to turn the handle after you enter the code when you open it. But on the bright side, it is really close to downtown and some cool coffee shops and public transportation. "
,,,,,,,,"Exactly what I needed, a short walk to 6th street and a comfy bed for the return!"
,,,,,,,,"í•˜ë£¨ ì´í‹€ ìž˜ ê³³ì´ í•„ìš”í•œë°, ì €ë ´í•˜ê³  ì¡°ìš©í•œ ê³³ì„ ì›í•œë‹¤ë©´ ì ë‹¹í•¨. "
,,,,,,,,"It's close to the Austin Convention Center so that's a plus. There's a cleaner that cleans the place everyday, but the house is old and showing signs. There's a single bathroom for 3+ guests which is also a bit inconvenient."
,,,,,,,,"This was a cute and convenient air b&b and it was a great experience staying here. They keyless entry was very convenient, the room simple and functional and the location was super convenient for being close to downtown. "
,,,,,,,,Nice clean room with security component for each room.  The facilities were cleaned both days I was there.  In good location for reasonable Lyft/Uber rides to Brazos and many central locations. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice neighborhood, proximate to a lot of things to do, accurately described by hosts."
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Overall was a good experience for the price, but the room is much smaller and not as nice as these pictures lead you to believe. "
,,,,,,,,Nice place to stay~~
,,,,,,,,"First of all, this place is located next door to a CAT CAFE. If that doesn't excite you, I don't know what will. It's walking distance - a little less than a mile - from 6th street (almost 1 mile exactly to Empire Control Room on 7th). In the opposite direction, it's only about a mile away from a vegan restaurant called Counter Culture, so that is awesome as well. This particular room is somewhat small compared to the other rooms in the house, but it's the room right across from the bathroom, so I appreciated that. It's at the back of the house away from potential front door / kitchen noise. As you can see in the description of the house, you are sharing it with two other rooms, so you share the kitchen and bathroom. We didn't have any issues there, and the other people staying in the house at the same time as us were polite and respectful. You have access to  wifi, a microwave, and a full-sized refrigerator, so you have everything you need. We really enjoyed our stay and appreciated being within walking distance to the places we needed to be. "
,,,,,,,,"The room was set up when I arrived, and the house was clean. I enjoyed my stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Definitely an awesome space. Fast WiFi, great bed, not a very big room and no central A/C but the important things were there. Very comfortable, and door locks were great."
,,,,,,,,Total chichole. Would never stay there again.
,,,,,,,,"The description of the place is accurate.  Plenty of parking on the street.  Felt safe in the neighborhood and walking around.  The room is small, but comfortable.  The floor in the bedroom could have been swept better.  Overall, I'm satisfied.  "
,,,,,,,,"Julia was very responsive and checked in at several points during the stay to make sure we were doing fine. We were very happy to stay here, especially as our reservation was so last-minute, and would go back the next time we're in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Great concept. Like a tiny hotel
,,,,,,,,"Was very Clean, nice and small it did the job. came to town to see a college bb game..neighborhood was quiet and it was a small walk to the downtown area."
,,,,,,,,"If you're looking for a super easy, relatively cheap place to crash for a night or two in a good location and you don't really care about needing lots of room or high level of cleanliness than this is the place for you. I spent very little time there but it was a convenient location near lots of cool bars and restaurants. Was it super clean? No. They either didn't wash the sheets or the washer they use is terrible because I woke up to six different peoples hair (mine is very very short), but I was too hungover to really care. It's a comfy bed and they provide fresh towels. They were very clear with instructions on the codes for the rooms and I felt very safe as a single female in a new city who wanted to have a night on the town. "
,,,,,,,,"We had some emergency in Austin as our flight was cancelled and the place we had stayed was not available for an extra night. The instant booking that Julia offers made that day a lot less stressfull as we knew right away that we had a new place lined up! Getting in the place was super easy, the pictures are bang on, the place has a nice hostel feeling which I personally loved."
,,,,,,,,"Great stay, perfect location for downtown festivities, super comfy bed, very clean, excellent host (description is as described, and great communication). Would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing! Great location, always an uber outside, quiet, stress free apartment. A+ for the hosts not being there meant apartment was always empty, will book here again!"
,,,,,,,,"A solution for max 1-2 nights.
Neighborhood up and coming and decently close to city centre, with the cool Blue Cat Caffee right the next door!
The flat is only used for Airbnb, so don't expect any charm, neither in the room nor in the common spaces.
Room was small but ok, with portable air heater and  a comfy bed. Toilette comfort and room cleanliness might be improved. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Very welcoming and host and great communication throughout. 
Slight issue/confusion with the code for the front door not being sent to me. But solved easily and fairy quickly. 
The room was little more basic than the pictures suggest and there was no light in my bedroom which made me feel a bit like I was camping! Bathroom very nice and shower was lovely!
The location is great but the neighbourhood is quite a shabby looking area. "
,,,,,,,,It was great! Super easy and the stay was nice. If you're Looking for something cheap and basic this is great stay 
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location for downtown/conference center events. Julia was great, checked in to see if I needed anything. The house and room were fine as a place to stay, just not as clean/updated as the photos seemed. All in all a good experience."
,,,,,,,,"There was a slight miscommunication when I arrived; I received the automated code for my room within the house, but not for the front door. However it was resolved within 30 minutes and the rest of my stay was great! I would highly recommend this house. It's a cozy house in a great, convenient neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,"It's a pretty cramped room in a house shared with two other Airbnb guests. Don't think anyone ever lived in this house, it's more of a hostel."
,,,,,,,,Adorable house that is in a great location
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect. 
We will come back for sure. 
Great location !"
,,,,,,,,"Very good location, walking distance to downtown in an interesting and vibrant neighborhood. But it was not quite as spiffy as the impression I got form the picture, but OK. It was clean. It happened to be a cold night so the blankets were not quite adequate. Lighting only on the opposite side of the room from the bed made it a bit awkward."
,,,,,,,,"Julia was easy to contact and very accessible. The place itself is in a great location and everything you need for a stay in Austin. The beds are comfortable and the code security system to get in was easy to use and made us feel safe. It is within walking distance to both Rainy St and 6th St. If you are not up for walking, an Uber never cost us more than $5. The place is also right next door to a cat cafe which was pretty cool!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location for the price (#1 reason to stay here), door codes make it easy to get in and out, didn't try communicating but Julia seemed accessible. The house itself is much older and shabbier than I expected based on the photos, the ceilings are very low overall and lower in certain rooms (can't raise my arms in the bathroom without hitting the ceiling). The room is small so it's probably best if you don't plan on spending a lot of time in it--we didn't, so this wasn't a problem. Sheets were clean but could have used a change, they seemed to have accumulated some dust and lint either from use or from the comforter used with it. There seemed to be a number of people staying in other rooms, it was difficult getting the one bathroom in the morning. Also, room and bathroom floors are tile--cold in winter so bring bath slippers! Overall, not a bad experience but definitely not as homey as the photos look--once you see it, you'll see it's quite obviously a very-short-term-rental-only place. It's clean and relatively comfortable, but not well cared for."
,,,,,,,,Great place. Convenient location. Room is small but all one needs. Bathroom was clean. Nice swing in backward. A good AirBnB experience overall. Well priced. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place, nice and clean! Walking distance to Downtown which makes it great to visit Austin without spending money on cabs."
,,,,,,,,I showed up late every night. So I didn't see host. The description was accurate and the neighborhood was fine. 
,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately we had to cancel on Julia because all the flights were backed up and oversold into Austin for the weekend.  Her communication was great, and I wish we could have met.

-Simon"
,,,,,,,,"Thanks a bunch! Instructions were very clear and stress-free. All the little extras (hair dryer, water filter) made it a comfortable stay. Would def. use again. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was just as described. I really enjoyed my time in Austin, in part because this place was so conveniently located for everything I wanted to do. The check-in/out process was extremely easy and the bed was extremely comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend for anyone wanting to explore Austin. "
,,,,,,,,The house is exactly as described. Quiet little place that's about a 25 minute walk from downtown. No problems to speak of. The other guests were very respectful of noise and sharing space.  Would recommend if you're looking primarily for a place to sleep while you're out and about in Austin.
,,,,,,,,My experience was good overall.
,,,,,,,,"Pros: Great location, easy access (codes for the doors), very clean, comfy bed, AC definitely works well, and good water pressure in the shower. Other guests were polite.

Cons: The house was generally a bit more run-down than I expected based on the photos; there is no overhead light in the room and just a small lamp that needed to be moved from the shelf to the ground in order to illuminate the room.

Also: it's next to a cat cafe! So you can go pet a cat while you have some coffee in the morning :D (URL HIDDEN)"
,,,,,,,,"The listing and description were accurate, the room and house were clean and accessible. I was there for less than 20 hrs so I didn't get to interact with anyone but it was a great place to crash for a quick trip and is in a cool neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,Convenient room in a convenient location and the bed was more comfortable than my own. Close to so much in Austin. Would stay there again
,,,,,,,,Room was exactly as described and the bed was very comfy. Would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,Host was super responsive and helpful. Property was comfortable & clean. The aircon was great. 
,,,,,,,,"The place is ok. This was my second experience with AirBnb and the first time renting a room in a house, so I can't make a comparison. Service was average. I was confused by the number of people involved. More run down than the photo would indicate. I didn't get a washcloth. Location was kinda cool and I enjoyed eating nearby at Cenote. Can't say I'd recommend but not terrible."
,,,,,,,,I always look for places to feel like home and this was exactly it! I became homesick when I left and Austin isn't even my home! Definitely staying here the next time I visit! THANKYOU!  
,,,,,,,,Absolutely wonderful place!  Completely as advertised--and more!  Location was fantastic--I was on a business trip and was able to WALK to the Happy Hour reception!  Excellent deal for the price.  Would recommend anyone else to consider staying here.
,,,,,,,,Julia's place was great and just as advertised in the photo. The host was very considerate and responsive - highly recommended for future guests!
,,,,,,,,"Pretty clean and nice room, it was the bare essentials but its what I needed.  There was only 1 bathroom and three rooms of people, so it was kinda annoying sometimes, but other than that, it was great.

Comfortable memory foam bed, central AC, and convenient location. you can Uber to anywhere you need to in austin real quick if you don't like walking. real close to raniey st, and La Barbecue, which you need to get.  Good spot. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was simply great. Julie was easy to reach, and the house was clean, quiet, comfy, and easy to get into even though my flight got in at midnight. If you want a hassle-free experience near the main drag of a hip Austin neighborhood, look no further. "
,,,,,,,,Quaint and comfortable. Had no problems. Thank you! 
,,,,,,,,Very nice and coliseum to east 6st
,,,,,,,,The house was clean and the amenities were great. The room was a little small for the price but it was a great location. Overall a very pleasant experience!
,,,,,,,,"The room was fine and the bed was super comfortable. One of my towels smelled like mildew, which was gross. The bathroom door sticks so it was loud every time someone went in or out and woke me up a lot (I was in room 3 across the hall from it). But everything else was good and it is in super close proximity to downtown and SoCo. "
,,,,,,,,This was the perfect spot to crash for a night in Austin. Not too much to the place but it was clean and convenient 
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great! I spend there only two nights, the house is small but is perfect if you just want to spend a night there and just relax after whole day of walking/ driving ( like i did).

The house is not far away from the 6thstreet ( 15min walk) its pretty close. 

I didnt meet Julia but if you need something just call/ text and she will text you back and answer/ help you with your all question. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Nice experience; the house was clean, nice, price supergood! "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great! I spend there only two nights, the house is small but is perfect if you just want to spend a night there and just relax after whole day of walking/ driving ( like i did). I like my room, it was small but is perfect for 2 people. 
The house is not far away from the 6thstreet ( 15min walk) its pretty close.!
I didnt meet Julia but if you need something just call/ text and she will text you back and answer/ help you with your all question.
I really recommend HOST!
 "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was as described, it was nice and clean. The room was very small and sparsely furnished, but it was practical. I was pleased that you had wifi. The kitchen looked great and very complete. I would bring food in on another visit. I would like to experience another one of your properties. I am usually around 35 and 290, but the location is flexible. I am looking for a regular place to stay on my weekly trip to Austin. It was a pleasure. "
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect
,,,,,,,,"Had an awesome time at this place, short walk to great tacos and the cbd, very easy to get in and door to bedroom has its own lock code which is cool. Everything clean and looked after, would definitely stay again, would have liked to have stayed longer, recommended."
,,,,,,,,"It was a great location, clean house, loved my stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This room was perfect for what I needed, which was just a place to sleep after a night out. Julia was very responsive to inquiries. The front door and door to the room use electronic doorknobs into which you enter a code, so there is no worry about coordinating a time to pick up and drop off keys. Location is easily accessible to I-35 and downtown and it was super easy to get super cheap Ubers over to sixth street. "
,,,,,,,,"Great little house. This is the second time with this host, different house. Great stay either way! Thank you! "
,,,,,,,,"This place worked out well for my needs, since it was within walking distance of the festival. There was some confusion about which room was mine â€”Â they have a code system, rather than someone to bring you in â€” but that appears to have been my mistake. The interior of the home was clean, and the setup gave me no problems, except perhaps for the awkward door handle and door that had a hard time closing."
,,,,,,,,"Great room for a great price in an awesome location. If you need something safe, quiet, and in a great location in Austin I would highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"It was a great location, clean, and at a great price;"
,,,,,,,,"Way too expensive for the worth. The room felt claustrophobic & strangers walking around the house made it a bit weird. I booked last minute cos I was desperate, I wouldn't recommend unless you literally just want a mattress to crash on. The neighbours could see everything in the room. No privacy, but Julie seemed to be nice enough."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great. This was my first airbnb experience. Julia made everything super easy and convenient. It was just was I was looking for. It was close to downtown and a great little neighborhood. 

I highly recommend a stay here. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was cute and clean. I loved the keypad door handles, and the very comfortable bed. 1 mile from 6th St. and Rainey St. Made it a perfect location. Thanks Julie!"
,,,,,,,,"The listing description was partially accurate. The place is a run down old house in East Austin that has windows that don't lock, a door that has a 1/2"" space between the door and the floor, a restroom that is shared with 7 other people, and the bed had not been cleaned before my arrival so I had to go out and purchase sheets. 
What's more, Julia does not live on the property. She owns a couple of property and rents them out full time to Airbnb so it's more like a hostel than a private place. #disappointed"
,,,,,,,,Very convenient and simple. Well worth the price.
,,,,,,,,Great
,,,,,,,,Very good place to stay! Thanks Julia!
,,,,,,,,"Check-in and check-out was very easy and host was very friendly. Gave plenty of personal recommendations and was happy to answer plenty of questions about the area. Super hospitable. The room was as shown - quite small, but the bed was super comfortable, heater worked fine, etc. It was exactly as I expected and the kind hosts were a nice bonus."
,,,,,,,,Great location! Clean apartment! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin!
,,,,,,,,"This is an overpriced AirBNB flophouse.  $50 would be more like it.

Pros:
1) Comfortable bed
2) Beer in fridge
3) Living room space
4) Close to Downtown
5) Good WIFI

Cons:
1) Overpriced
2) Tiny room barely big enough for a queen bed
3) No central heating (or AC). On a cold weekend in Austin, I had to manage a portable heater that left the room too hot or too cold.
4) Sketchy electrical wiring.  There were outlets dangling from the walls and uprotected wiring.  The room had no lightswitch and minimal outlets.  Seemed unsafe.
5) The house generally felt like a hastily flipped ""airBNB shack"".  The doors did not close properly, everything felt slapped together.
6) No TV.

Except for proximity to Downtown and the mattress, Motel 6 would have been a better value. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great. The apartment has a number lock at the door and a number lock for each of the three rooms, so getting into the room is easy and safe. Good location, about 20mins walk to downtown, and a coffee shop (Cenote) and food truck are nearby within 5mins walking. The internet was working, there's a water filter in the kitchen. The room has an AC and working heater"
,,,,,,,,"Julia was a great host. Very easy to communicate and accommodating to my stay and my changes in plans, and the bed is ridiculously comfortable. For the price? Location location location. Great stay in Austin. House is as pictured, and a great nights rest."
,,,,,,,,Good!  Clean! And the bed is amazingly comfortable
,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed my stay there. Very comfy and next to a lot of great spots. We would really recommend this to anyone passing through.
,,,,,,,,"We were very happy with our stay at Julia's BnB. Notably, the bed was ridiculously comfortable, there is a full kitchen, combination locks for each separate room, and the location was a quick cab ride from plenty of exciting Austin bars(so quick, in fact, that we could have walked). Overall, this was a great place to rest after a long drive and a bit of exploring Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to say! Didn't meet Julia as I was not there much.

Bed was comfortable and house was clean."
,,,,,,,,Julia is very quick with responding to my emails. The room is a bit small but it's comfortable. It's right by the bathroom which was great. The location is very conveniently located to lots of Austin tourist attractions. My very first Airbnb and it was a great experience. 
,,,,,,,,I didn't meet Julia but the place was simple and clean with a comfy bed.  Julia always answered all queries very promptly. 
,,,,,,,,"I arrived a few days after the agreed time and left a day early, so I didn't have the opportunity to meet Julia (or the host). I spent most of the time at Cenote Cafe, which is a great coffee only 2 blocks away from the house. This place is located in a great place. Walking distance to 6th st where all the tourist magic happens but also walking distance to rainy street where you can see a lot of locals. "
,,,,,,,,"Julia made Airbnb so simple! Perfect for my frist stay & inspired me to list my spot in SF. Location was good, about a mile from 6th street downtown area and even closer to rainey bars/restaurants. I had a blast. Thanks Julia, wish I was able to meet you in person!"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience with Julia was awesome. Better than a hotel and perfect walking distance to coffee, bars, and dancing. Place was chill. "
,,,,,,,,"Julia has a very cute house, just a few blocks away from a great cafe (Cenote), all the fun on 6th street, and a $5 ride from the big hotels downtown. 

I didn't get to meet Julia personally, but I appreciated the electronic keypads, felt very safe."
,,,,,,,,"
Julia's place is a perfect place to stay near dowtown ..... everything was clean and quiet neighborhood also ....I recommend this place to anybody !!!"
,,,,,,,,Julia's place was great. Very comfortable and cosy. Sara and Jordan who were co hosting were really helpful for folks like me who are new in town. Will get in touch again when return! Thanks guys. 
,,,,,,,,"Julia wasn't here but I was able to talk to her friend by email, and she answered to all my emails and really quickly. Even if I was late with my friend we got to the place, (something like midnight), her friend told us that it wasn't a problem, and she just gave to us the code to get inside the house (no keys!). Calm area, really near from downtown, and close to 6th street with a lot of bars and live concerts. You can go to downtown in 20 minutes by bike (8 dollars for 24 hours) or by bus (2 dollars only). 

If I don't put 5 stars, it's just because I would say that room 1 is really small. I don't know about rooms 2 and 3.

If you don't want to be completly downtown, I think this private room has a descent price, good location, and also it's really clean.



"
,,,,,,,,"This place is exactly what I needed. A clean place to crash with access anytime and clean sheets. Julia was accommodating when my schedule changed and I needed to come a day early. 

Easy access downtown to Rainey, 6th Street and the Congress bats. 

Thanks so much! "
,,,,,,,,"The 3rd room was pretty much a bed and four walls with a freestanding clothing rack and a small side table for a lamp.  The doors are all code-unlocked, which was nice as I ended up getting in at 2:45am on my first night and left at 6am on the  last morning, so I didn't feel like I was inconveniencing anyone.  

I was out for the National Brewskee-Ball Championships the entire time, so I literally only was in the house to sleep and shower, so an inexpensive, no-frills option was perfect for me.  

The only reason I took off a star was that the room was super hot at night with the door closed (I kept it shut as I had no idea who else was staying in the house) and the windows opened up to street level with no screens, so I didn't want to get torn up by bugs.  The rest of the unit was air conditioned, but my room wasn't, so the first night was a lot of tossing and turning.  Other than that, it's a great option for someone who just needs a bed to crash on!"
,,,,,,,,"Simple accommodation, no frills but clean and friendly. Very minimal security, so would not advise bringing anything valuable with you. 

Was a little confused on arrival since neither Julia or Jordan are the actual point of contact - it was Sara! Nevertheless Sara was friendly and helpful."
,,,,,,,,"We stayed in room #3 - the bed was comfortable, the room was clean, and Julia provided two towels for us. However, there didn't seem to be any air conditioning in the room and it was so stuffy and hot... we were there in early May so I can't imagine the summer! 

The house is in a great location and we had no problem communicating with Julia and the person she has helping out with the property. It did seem a bit overpriced for what you're getting though, especially compared to my other airbnb experiences in the neighborhood."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed there for couple of days. The house is nice, loved that the doors have doorknobs with code (no keys needed). Was a little confusing as I wasn't expecting that in each room guests are changing almost every night. A big problem was the safety â€“Â in a room next to mine window got smashed twice. No air conditioning in the room I was staying. Besides that I would recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"Juliet apparently changes identity from time to time.  Now she has become Julia, and I see a review from a previous guest that calls her Jordan.  She was unavailable by phone or in person from 2 days before our scheduled arrival.  We never met her.  Instead, we found a filthy room, dirty sheets on the bed, with no clean sheets available.  
Note that the house has 3 rooms for rent, plus a trailer for rent, and no locks on the bedroom doors.  
The bathroom was equally dirty and unacceptable.  We have photographs of these conditions.  The cleaning woman was there when we arrived, but she said that she does not clean bedrooms or bathroom.  She said, ""that is Juliet's responsibility and she is not doing what she should.""  We called Juliet to figure out what to do, and she texted that she was busy until 10:30pm and could call at that time.  We found another hotel, and we have not recovered our reservation payment yet.  
The house is not properly finished with construction.  There are multiple building code violations, and Room #3 is quite depressing - it is the size of a closet, no decor or furnishing other than a bed, with a bare ceramic bulb that has no operable switch."
,,,,,,,,"My stay here was decent. On the positive side, I LOVED the location/neighborhood. Totally funky and not in downtown/anywhere close to the manic 6th street vibe, but still close in enough that you can use the city's bike share and transit and get around easily. The street the house is on is quiet and close to lots of funky little eateries (my fave was the nearby Cenote for breakfast/brunch, within a close walk). Since this is really a house with a caretaker who rents out the three rooms and airstream, you might like this if you are actually preferring a somewhat anonymous stay. On the downside, quite a few things. Most notably in reference to my room (#3), the room is tiny, like not even big enough to open a suitcase on the floor. The description on air bnb mainly describes the bed and now I know why. The room (and the house itself) are absolutely bare bones - literally white walls with no decor at all and extremely limited furnishings. I was dismayed to arrive very late at night only to find that my room had no light switch (bulb had to be somewhat dangerously screwed in and out for light - I complained about it and they installed a pull cord on the bulb before I left several days later, so at least that has been fixed). Also, #3 has no closet or shelves or anything, just a bare white room with a bed in it that takes up almost the whole room and somewhat depressing views out the gray curtained windows into the yard, which apparently they have plans for but was full of flotsam while I was there. There was an empty cheap metal rack in the room with no hangers. I borrowed some from another guest down the hall and commandeered a dusty bookshelf from the living room to act as shelves in my room, which sufficed and made things much more liveable. I also had an open electrical plate in my room that had wires sticking out, which they sort of fixed while I was there. Living room was completely barren during my visit, no furniture at all (except dusty bookshelf that I used in my room). Bathroom is fine though a little dingy. I think/hope they are in the process of redoing things? Finally, my host Juliet was nice, but I never did meet her. And weirdly, I got reviewed by the new manager Julia (positive), who I never met and never heard of. It looks like they rotate managers often, based on the other reviews. Also, know that up to 4 or more guests (3 rooms plus airstream) may share the same single bathroom (not a problem on my stay, but something to note). Overall, I loved the location and space was just OK. I think rooms #1 and #2 would be better."
,,,,,,,,"Stayed in one of the bedrooms, great location. Close to Rainey street area. Accommodations were as pictured and clean. All went smoothly and hosts were responsive. Would stay at their location again. "
,,,,,,,,"Juliet was a great hostess from my stay in Austin.  I was in and out on a Friday night as I had an early flight out on Saturday.  Everything was easy and accessible and I had no issues whatsoever.  Juliet also accommodated me on last minute notice and was very responsive in getting everything set up.  Thanks for all of your help, Juliet."
,,,,,,,,Great time!  Loved being so close to 6th Street and all the great music.  Great setup with parking and all the necessary amenities.  Thanks Juliet!
,,,,,,,,"Juliet has been the most gracious, accommodating and hospitable host to us since our extended stay in Austin. The majority of our elongated stay here is due to our home away from home - Juliet's East Austin B&B. (seriously, it's like we're never going to leave here!).  It's located in one of the best parts of town, and in one of the most charming homes we've seen (i'm a sucker for airstreams). We basically took over the front room while they were renovating, it's all freshly painted and the memory foam mattresses are more comfy than any bed i've ever slept on. Will be very sad to leave this place and will be sure to book any time we are back in town! (unless we move here) x"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Jordan's for SXSW music festival. The place is on east downtown, about a 5 block walk, not too bad. The neighborhood is a little sketchy but since there were a lot of people walking that was ok.

The bed in that room is AMAZING, but the room had no curtains. I think Jordan just bought the place because you could see they were still remodeling. Would stay there again."
15093679,,10,10,10,10,10,10,Jeremy was an awesome host! We were originally nervous about renting a room versus a private apartment but are really happy with our choice. It was great to have someone from the area who was able to give amazing restaurant suggestions. We felt like we were staying at a friends house rather than a strangers. Highly recommend! 
14708252,5,10,10,10,8,10,10,Great location within walking distance from downtown and east side restaurants and bars. House is very tidy and sharp.
,,,,,,,,"Terrific little house, perfect for 3 or max 4 people. Short ride and 15 min walk to vibrant night life and restaurants. Nora was great in communication and answering questions. "
,,,,,,,,"Nora's home is even better than the photos. Beautiful and super clean home. The neighborhood is really calm, Nora gave us great food recommendations around, and it was super easy to communicate with her. Thanks again for having us :)"
,,,,,,,,Everything pretty much exceeded expectations. Nora wrote out a map and list of Austin's best places to go and eat. The house is beautiful and the all white theme was very cool. Would highly recommend her as a host and as a future airbnb! 
300574,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Great location for South Congress and downtown access. Veronica was very helpful and everything was a breeze. Definitely a retro, funky place. Very cool (but be careful on those stairs!)."
,,,,,,,,One the most unique places to stay in Austin. Don't think twice about staying here!
,,,,,,,,"Great stay, Veronica is very accommodating and helpful thank you for letting us stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a great host! She communicated really well, and the place was exactly as pictured & described. The location is prime to great restaurants and neighborhoods. Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was super nice, easy to reach & very hospitable! The cottage was perfect for all 3 of us. The loft was spacious, charming & chic! I loved the vintage vibe & the location is so convenient to everything from food, fun & entertainment. Veronica was very quick to respond & she was very friendly & her property was electric & warm & inviting. I will define you rebook this cottage, as it is right in the heart of Austin &  Veronica made everything easy & was laid back & very friendly."
,,,,,,,,This loft is a great combination of rustic personality with modern amenities. Veronica was easy to communicate with and the neighborhood is close to some beautiful parks and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,Victoria was responsive via text and the key pad lock on her cottage was extremely convenient.
,,,,,,,,"We had an awesome weekend in Austin! The arrival process was really easy and Veronica was so helpful and friendly all throughout. Her place has a great Austin vibe, in a great location and easy to get to anything you might want to see."
,,,,,,,,"It was really easy to access the property.  The place is adorable and artsy and very clean.  The bed is comfortable!  The listing makes VERY CLEAR that it is a loft/part loft.  No issue for we 63 year olds, but important to know that!  We were out an about a lot, but could have spent long hours enjoying the space and the property on a different type of visit.  

We're walkers - the South Congress area was reachable on foot, as was the library, Elizabeth St. Cafe, Bouldin Creek Cafe, etc.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, very comfortable, great host.  Enjoyed my stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was incredibly helpful and sweet. She made sure we had everything we needed. If you're looking for a cozy, retro place to stay - this is the place! Plus, the location is fabulous. Highly highly recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time staying in the loft for a long weekend exploring Austin!  Very cozy and everything we needed was there.  We appreciated the extra beach/pool towels for taking with us to Barton Springs.  The neighborhood is walkable to a bunch of good food and music on South Lamar St., S. Congress, and S. 1st, and we learned a couple of bus routes and one of the local rideshare apps to get to downtown or further south - totally doable without a car, even in the heat!"
,,,,,,,,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Has charm and that cozy feeling.  I didn't feel like I was in a cookie cutter  sterile rental.  Super easy door access.  The stairs may be a bit steep for someone but I had no problems.  Had all your bath amenities which was nice.  Full kitchen but I never used it.   I loved the location as it was a 5-10 minute walk to the trails.  You could also walk to a bus stop within five mins.  Ride Austin found me easily when I needed car service to go out at night.   It is obvious that the owner cares about this space.  I really did feel like I was staying in someone's home...minus the someone.  :)  I did know if I needed the owner's help, I would have it.  I am pretty self sufficient so didn't need to contact the owner for anything.  And, nothing was needed.  If you can book this, do it!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's place is absolutely perfect! Arrival was seamless, the place looks adorable and we loved the location. I want to design my kitchen at home to match! We would stay at the cottage again in a second. We're climbers, and we were able to drive 45 minutes to lake Travis to deep water solo. It was amazing! Also, we walked every morning to a cute coffee shop ~10 minutes through the neighborhood. Veronica instantly responded to all of our questions, and we loved meeting her briefly in the garden. This is the perfect place for your Austin adventure! "
,,,,,,,,Veronica's place is great! It's got a funky cool charm to it. I loved staying in Bouldin Creek and had a great week in the cottage.
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying in this super cute Austin vibe loft! Veronica was easy to communicate with. The place was well equipped with coffee/tea/snacks etc and everything you might need for cooking. Location wise it was great, within walking distance to the springs and plenty of cute bars/cafes/shops. Would definitely stay again! Thanks Veronica!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a absolute joy to work with in getting me ready for my arrivsl. I've rented two places in Austin in the past, one being in her neighborhood. So, I know what I'm looking for when I stay here. This was a great fit! It's own space, quiet and comfortable. Also, funky and unique in some great ways. Loved it!  Stay! "
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 52 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Authentic South Austin!  Veronica's guest house is full of treasures and all the amenities you need.  Very comfortable stay in a great location.  Veronica is a sweetheart.  Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's place was awesome, and exactly as described. She's obviously put a lot of care into cultivating a look and feel that's very appreciated. Beds were comfortable and the kitchen had enough niceties that crashing there was no sweat. I only got to meet her once, but Veronica was super nice and hospitable. This is a great location. Go for it."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's place is absolutely amazing. The location is perfect, the place is super clean and so well decorated. It just makes you feel welcomed yet so disconnected from the normal hustle and bustle. I have tried other AirBnB in Austin and this the best, no contest. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was set up and ready to go for us upon arrival - very easy to navigate, make use of amenities and feel comfortable in. "
,,,,,,,,Veronica was super lovely and we had a fantastic time! Such a cute little space-- will definitely try to book it the next time I'm in town!
,,,,,,,,Great location!
,,,,,,,,Veronica is a great communicator and everything was as-advertised.  The A/C worked great!  The only negative was that the outdoor area was not well looked after.
,,,,,,,,"First time with Airbnb and I'm so glad it was at Veronica's loft. The location is great and close to all the nearby attractions. The loft has such lovely character and it has everything all you can possibly need! Veronica was a lovely host and provided us with tips and ideas for our stay in Austin. Also, Zeus is adorable! "
,,,,,,,,"This space is perfect for a couple visiting Austin. It's a short drive from downtown as well as the happening areas of Bouldin Creek, South Congress, and Austin's East Side â€” and yet removed enough to provide a calm residential reprieve from the city. The air conditioning works wonderfully, and the kitchen, bathroom, and living areas are stocked to accommodate. The loft has an eclectic, curated charm that fits right into the Austin experience. All our communication and processes with Veronica went well. The loft is in a garden next to her home, i.e., convenient if we needed her, but we felt we had ample space to be on our own. I'd gladly return!"
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely loved staying here! As soon as I walked in, it felt like home. Veronica was such a gracious host and was very accessible. Was in town for a conference and it was a great retreat to go home to at the end of a busy day. Wonderful neighborhood - close to downtown and nature! Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a unique and welcoming base for your Austin adventure! Thank you so much, Veronica! I really appreciate your kindness and wonderful space. "
,,,,,,,,"The little house was adorable and comfortable for our needs!  Veronica was a lovely host and gave us some tips on exploring Austin.  The house has a code access vs key, which was very convenient as we didn't have to worry about losing it. "
,,,,,,,,What a great experience to stay in Veronica's cottage! The location was perfect for my conference that I was attending! 
,,,,,,,,Veronica's little house was an awesome place to stay for my partner and I! It had everything you could possibly need and she was a great host. The house was decorated very well and had a lot of character to it. The location was awesome and very close to everything. Such a peaceful little oasis :] We will be booking again for the next time we want to come visit Austin!
,,,,,,,,"I will be staying here again, I hope. It was quiet, safe, and conveniently located next to downtown. I walked back and forth every day and was able to appreciate the city without staying downtown. Veronica and her place were perfect."
,,,,,,,,"Great spot, great neighborhood in South Austin away from all the bullshit. Veronica was awesome, super-accommodating and very easy to deal with. Highly recommend this spot!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 145 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time at Veronica's funky little cottage. It's situated in the most gorgeous [and quiet] neighborhood. Right off of 1st (tons of food!) and super close to Congress as well, it really was the HEART of everything that you should do and eat in Austin. Very clean, exactly as pictures. Veronica was also instant on responses and any questions.

We loved our stay and will surely be returning!"
,,,,,,,,"The house is really cool and comfortable, had no problems with anything. The neighborhood is nice and it's a comfortable walk to downtown if you can take the heat and humidity of Austin! Veronica was out of town but left very clear instructions and everything we could have needed was there for us."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Veronica's place was the next best thing to living in Austin... Seriously.m we loved the cottage and the location was off the hook!  Everything we needed for a long weekend in a new City was waiting for us at Veronica's artsy oasis.  Your gardens are beautiful and the loft was graciously appointed with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Love the decor, loved the working windows (sounds simple, but not always the case), very comfy bed and great rain head shower to start each day!  Highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for an authentic Austin stay.  "
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a great time at Veronica's! She (and Zeus) was welcoming, accommodating, and had great recommendations for things to do in Austin. We all agree that next time we are there, if the space is available this is where we will stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica made our stay enjoyable. The location of the cottage is perfect for exploring the sites and eats of Austin. We enjoyed coming back to this hip, retro-vintage and funky space that made us feel as though we were still experiencing the charm of Austin our entire time in the city. Especially enjoyed the privacy and ease of access upon check-in. Would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,Super convenient location.
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's place is super nice. The neighborhood is close to everything and the little house is one of the coziest places I have ever been to. Veronica is very responsive and easy to communicate with. She's also got a very friendly dog Zeus, who is adorable. I highly recommend this place! "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's Groovy cottage was everything we could of expected and more! It was super cute, cozy, and clean! We loved the fun and mod aesthetic as well as the layout. I must also say that Veronica probably facilitated the most seamless Airbnb interaction with a host, something that isn't always easy to find. We felt right at home and absolutely loved the neighborhood. It was so close to everything it felt like we were back in NY. This little gem gave us some serious city envy that we could see ourselves moving to this beautiful town one day. "
,,,,,,,,"The place is in an amazing location and is very private.
Veronica is a great help (even more so than (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)) in finding the best places to go for eating, drinking and entertainment and is always ready to answer questions.
It really was the perfect set up."
,,,,,,,,"That old stable was so cool! I felt at home, and yet in a new place, all at once. It's even cooler in real life than the pictures are able to describe. It's well within (norwegian) walking distance to downtown, South Congress, the parks and everything. 
The bathroom is really modern, the bed upstairs is really comfortable, and the downstairs area is just so cool. I was working on a book on this trip, so I spent several hours there writing. It's really nicely decorated, good mix of older and newer furniture and lots of great posters and art-prints on the walls. Veronica even put in a good tea-pot for me as I told here before I arrived that I am a tea nerd. 
Veronica is a super sweet lady, and a great host. And I really loved her dog. And her husband who I unfortunately forgot the name of. 
Austin has changed a lot since I visited for the first time five years ago. This place represents all that is good with old and weird Austin. Totally recommended, I'd love to come back! "
,,,,,,,,"Hi, I brought my adult daughter and best friend on a trip to Austin so we could spend time together in a cozy place and enjoy this delightful little city. The cottage was spectacularly located, warm, friendly, whimsical and had all the comforts of home. We loved being able to walk in the very eclectic neighborhood, walk downtown, walk to several local restaurants. The neighborhood felt safe and at all times comfortable to walk to the places we wanted to go. The cottage has a flair of fun/comfort/delightful and playful. The host was incredibly helpful and lovely. She gave us great tips on places to go and seemed to represent the best of the Austin hospitality that seemed to be everywhere we went. I would recommend this cottage to anyone interested in a playful atmosphere. The staircase to the upstairs was steep and not a problem for any of us but might be if someone in the party had mobility problems. Since we are all fine in that department it was absolutely perfect. I liked the lighting for reading at night and the shower pressure was fantastic. The kitchen was well supplied and I couldn't have been happier. Very very nice and we  will be back!!! Also the window shades were very easy to use and that was a plus since there were was an abundance of windows. The bed was very comfortable and everything was just great. And to top it off, if you are a dog lover, Veronica has the MOST cute, cuddly dog you could ever imagine if you need a fix of scratching ""Fido's"" head and chin. Couldn't get enough of him, but maybe I could, since I can't remember his name. Of course, that could be the margaritas talking since we had our fair share in the local restaurants. Regardless, between Veronica and ""Fido"" and the charm of the whole property a spectacular time was had by all. "
,,,,,,,,"It's always nice to find different types of places to stay on Airbnb and Veronica's loft did not disappoint. It was gorgeous. It was the perfect size for 2 people and was decorated with amazing antique furniture. We didn't get to use the kitchen (why would you when there's so many yummy places to eat in Austin!) but it looked like it had everything you'd need if cooking. The bathroom was large and clean. Veronica was also lovely - she welcomed us when we arrived, letting us know we could contact her at any time if needed but everything was perfect. We'd definitely stay here again if in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Enjoyed a lovely stay at Veronica's little abyss, which is perfectly tucked away in Austin's lush Bouldin Creek neighborhood. The cottage provided a perfect home base for first time travelers to Austin. We were able to comfortably walk to all of the destinations that we had planned for our trip (including the lovely Barton Springs and more metropolitan areas of Austin's downtown), while also getting to enjoy the peace and quiet of this space after a long day. 
Veronica was a perfect and accommodating host! We have nothing but good to report :) "
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed our time in Austin and Veronica's little stone cottage was perfect for my wife and me. It's very comfortable and we loved the distinct funky decor. I was able to walk the mile into my office downtown easily and the view is great along the river. Keyless lock made it easy to get in and out and Veronica was very responsive if we had any questions. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,Great stay. Place was as described.  Veronica was always very prompt in responding to me if I sent her a message.  Good neighborhood and location. 
,,,,,,,,"Artsy, spacious  and sunny cottage with that ""Keep Austin Weird"" vibe. Great location for music festivals, South Congress and downtown. Loads of room for all your ""stuff."" Very comfortable bed. VERONICA is the perfect hostess, unobtrusive but available if you need her. Cottage is separate and very private. Kitchen is fully equipped. Bathroom is large with lots of storage. Clean and neat. We highly recommend this cute cottage!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Veronica's adorable loft for a week and it was such a great experience. The place was so comfortable and had everything we needed. Veronica was super friendly and met us when we got in, gave us some great suggestions for places to see while we were in town. She was also really responsive when we reached out with questions.

The location is really convenient if you want to be close to downtown (10 minute bus ride) and right in the heart of south congress, which is so great for coffee, food, and shopping. 

Thanks so much, Veronica! "
,,,,,,,,"Such a cute funky little-yet-spacious cottage! Loved all the decorations and the place was stocked with everything we could have possibly wanted. Plenty of space for my mom (who rated the upstairs bed very comfy) and myself (the downstairs bed is comfier than I expected!). We felt that it was really private and quiet (and I am very noise-sensitive), yet located within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. It's in a residential neighborhood, but just a half mile walk to a small food truck scene and a cluster of restaurants, and a pleasant mile walk to both Congress and downtown. We were out and about so never ran into Veronica, but she checked in with us several times and the handoff was seamless. Good shower, lots of light, and she even left out a little assortment of teas and snacks. It's clear that Veronica put a lot of care into decorating and running this sweet guest house!"
,,,,,,,,What a great location! So close to so many things and a cozy hideaway to relax in. Veronica was super nice and a true Austin spirit. The cottage was perfect for us both and I felt right at home. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. Assuming my heart could still beat after all the queso we ate. :) A+
,,,,,,,,"Veronica made us feel warmly welcomed. She was very considerate and kind and had her home looking very inviting. She went out of her way to give us information about the area -I a loverly person. t's a great place to stay and we loved the neighbourhood. We hired bikes and it was wonderful to go down to Barton Creek and Springs and the weather was blissfully sunny so we rode along the green belt - a real pleasure. In the other direction is So Co or South Congress with loads of chic shops and cafes and , above all, great live music venues - we enjoyed the Continental Club especially. We fell in love with Austin and we would definitely go back and stay at Veronica's"
,,,,,,,,"I had a truly pleasant stay here. Austin was my last stop on a business trip which included staying in AirBnbs in Dallas and Atlanta. I selected Veronica's house because it looked cheerful and fun. Upon arrival I saw that it exceeded my expectations! The location is very easy to find and centrally located. There is parking in the driveway. The first floor living room and kitchen are very cozy. I was very thankful for the complimentary coffee. A peaceful, welcoming 'at home' atmosphere. I went to sleep early because I was tired from my travels. I had a very restful sleep. The bed is very comfortable. The bathroom was well stocked with towels and toiletries. All in all it was truly a very pleasant stay. I didn't get to meet Veronica... but I did see her super cute pup outside. I would definitely stay here again when I am in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay in the cottage and in Austin!  The cottage was the perfect location, clean, beautifully decorated. We had a car, but ended up walking almost everywhere. The space itself felt like a vacation within a vacation. We would definitely stay here again if we ever find ourselves back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was superbly warm and friendly, and was always looking for ways to maximize our comfort. 

The space has a fun and homey feel to it. We fit quite well there as a group of four. The upstairs bed is *very* comfortable, and the couch and cot downstairs are fine for a few nights. Everything was very clean, the kitchen and bathroom are in good condition and Veronica supplied us with pillows and blankets galore. 

My entire group was satisfied and we'd all happily go again/recommend Veronica's listing to others.

The location was great for an easy walk to Auditorium Shores, and given the smallish size of the downtown area, most everywhere exciting was readily accessible to us even without having a car/taking rides."
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was really cute, well decorated and comfortable. Didn't get too much time to explore the neighborhood, but it's close to downtown and only a few blocks from a B-Cycle station. The garden is really cool. "
,,,,,,,,"This loft is simply amazing! A true Austin experience. Veronica was such a delight to work with & very accommodating.  My boyfriend and I were in town for his birthday & did a lot of exploring. There is so much to see nearby (within walking distance) and if needed, uberX is a nice and affordable way to get to around! I would certainly stay here again!  Thank you Veronica!"
,,,,,,,,"This cottage was even better than described!  Perfect place to stay, so much better than a boring hotel room.  Very eclectic, great recommendations on where to go, very private and quiet.  Neighborhood within walking distance to almost everything!  The only place we needed to drive was to Rainey St, so we took a quick and cheap Lyft ride.  Would love to stay here again, and I have already recommended to my friends and family!  "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing!  I had an incredible stay, and wish it could have been longer.  Veronica is a warm and thoughtful host."
,,,,,,,,"Listing accurate, quiet neighbourhood near amenities and city etc. Veronica very welcoming "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first stay through Airbnb and it was absolutely wonderful! Veronica is a top notch host, and my boyfriend and I immediately felt comfortable and at home thanks to her. The loft is located in a great area so a lot of places we visited were within walking distance. The few times our destination was too far to walk we used the bike rental or bus station that is located down the hill from the house. 

Veronica also had some great recommendations of places to shop, eat, etc. Come to find out she has lived in the house next to the loft for 40 years, so she is definitely a true Austin native who knows her stuff.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking stay somewhere with that unique, Austin vibe and who wants a host who sincerely cares that her guests have a great stay in a great city. Thanks for everything Veronica!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Veronica's place while we stayed in Austin for the Austin City Limits music festival. The proximity could not be beaten. People were parking their cars farther than we were walking every day.

Gorgeously decorated, super clean, quiet, airy, perfect temperature. Was the perfect place to come to every night and wake up in every morning. And the bed was very comfortable for two. The living room seating was perfect for lounging and talking.

It was nice to meet Veronica in the morning. She's very considerate, understanding, and knows how to make you feel at home. Truly cares about her guests - no attitude, no nonsense.

Next time in Austin, I certainly know where I want to stay!
"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first Air BnB experience and it was wonderful! Veronica made us feel welcome and the place was everything we had expected. The location was perfect for all of the things that we wanted to visit when we were in Austin. The beds were comfortable, the place was clean and cute. We would definitely recommend Veronica and her property."
,,,,,,,,This was our first Airbnb stay and Veronica was a wonderful and friendly host. The cottage is adorable and had everything we needed. Having your own space with so much style is a treat compared to the usual boring hotel rooms! Awesome location within walking distance to restaurants and shops.
,,,,,,,,"We loved Veronica's cottage! It was in a fabulous location, everything within a few minutes! The cottage had everything we needed, bed was very comfy and the decor was super fun and funky...even a few lone star beers in the fridge for us :) just what you would expect in Austin. Veronica was so sweet and helpful with local recommendations, and always got back to me right away when I had questions. Love the cottage and our host!"
,,,,,,,,"This cozy cottage is in a perfect spot on a quiet street! Located near Barton Springs Pool, Zilker Park, Soco, and loads of great food trucks and restaurants, this home was a great place for us to stay as we visited Austin. It was clean and well maintained, and we loved the eclectic furniture. Veronica made us feel welcome by leaving suggestions on where to go as well as extra beach towels in the bathroom. Keyless entry made it easy for us to arrive when we needed to. The only thing to note are slightly steep stairs to get to the bedroom and bathroom. However, we had no problems with that and would gladly stay here again!!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, clean trendy place, hostess is quick to respond to any emails. Couldn't come more highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"GROOVY is right! This little private loft/cottage was TOTALLY groovy!  My wife and I spent a week there and completely loved it. Really cozy, comfortable and close to everything we wanted (Barton Springs, Zilker Park, South 1st St, South Congress, S. Lamar, downtown) but it felt really quiet and private.  Veronica was wonderful, a true Austinite. We hated to leave."
,,,,,,,,"The cottage was just perfectly amazing!  No trouble checking in at all.  Close to everything and the neighborhood is just fabulous.
Veronica eas prompt with any questions, and we were brought extra towels on our second day without even asking :)     I will definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"The place was exactly as pictured. The A/C was wonderful in the Texas heat. Also, Veronica responded promptly to any questions I had. "
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent time staying at Veronica's cottage in Bouldin Creek. The space provided everything we needed for our weekend and was exactly as advertised in the listing. Additionally, the location could not be beaten. Veronica was very responsive and eager to provide recommendations for while we were visiting, including a dip in Barton Springs to escape the heat (for which extra towels were also included). I recommend anyone look into her properties when planning a trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,We felt very welcomed! The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood was just what we were looking for! We had a great time and loved the relaxing atmosphere! 
,,,,,,,,Veronica's place was fantastic.  The loft is separate from the main house with privacy and charm.  The location is great (walking distance to lots of South Austin and Barton Springs).  Veronica was responsive and helpful.  Great stay all around.  Would definitely return.
,,,,,,,,"Super groovy space. Loved the gardens. Downtown Austin, bcycle rentals, restaurants within walking distance. Didn't get to meet Veronica, but she responded quickly by text to any needs we had.   "
,,,,,,,,Loved this place! Everything in this cottage is charming and eccentric. I instantly felt at home. It's conveniently located to everything! It was also very quiet. I will definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a charming place to stay in a well-located, delightful neighborhood. It's leafy, it's quiet, and it's the farthest thing from a cookie-cutter, soulless subdivision you could imagine.  It's hard to describe the decor itself other than to say it's quintessentially Austin, which is a very good thing indeed.  
Veronica was very communicative and made the stay seamless. 
I found everything in the listing - photos and description - to be entirely accurate. If you look at over and say ""that looks like the kind of place I'd like to stay in,"" you should book it without hesitation. I know I will again."
,,,,,,,,"I come to Austin every 4-6 weeks for work, and I'm certain that I will just stay here going forward if it's open.  This really felt like a home away from home.  You are literally so close to everything, but with the added benefit of feeling like you're in a secluded, quiet and beautiful cottage that's just yours when you pull up the driveway.  "
,,,,,,,,We stayed at Veronica's place for a weekend in June. She made it easy as possible and we had privacy as needed.  Her neighborhood is in a beautiful part of Austin and we walked everywhere. Walked to the natural spring pool at nearby park and all the shops along South Congress.  All done in the hot 90 degree weather. We are not used to the heat being from SF. All in all a perfect weekend get away. 
,,,,,,,,"This place is fantastic and Veronica is an extremely gracious host. We couldn't have been happier with our stay. The location is prime and the space itself was, indeed, groovy and hip. I highly recommend staying here if you are traveling in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica and the house (and Zeus with his little moustache) are everything we love about airbnb. Full of character, the host and loft totally enhanced our stay in Austin and really contributed to a great experience. We were sad we had to leave to stay in a boring hotel!
The facilities were good - great shower, towels, rain ponchos and Veronica found us an umbrella which was appreciated with the storms. A beer in the fridge too, which was appreciated after a long travel in the humidity.
Loads of suggestions of places to go that Veronica though we might be into and fun chats in the day. We also loved the birds, cacophony of frogs and the plants. A little home from home. The location was a bit out of town but we liked the retreat and the area. Communication was great and Veronica was flexible with arrangements. We also enjoyed the poster collection! We'd definitely go back."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in Veronica's cottage. It was exactly as described - a real taste of Austin. It was just the right size for the 3 of us that stayed there. The location is great! It's walking distance to SoCo, the Congress Ave bridge, and downtown. We would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"Good location and very comfortable stay. Thanks, Veronica! There were a few beers in the fridge when we got there, and cereal bars too. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Veronica's was one of the reasons why our Austin trip was so memorable and fantastic. The place was filled with so much character and was in a very quiet yet convenient location. We didn't have a car and took Uber rides everywhere which were easy to get.  The house has everything you need (toiletries, hair dryer, towels, AC!!! etc.) and there were two Lone Star beers waiting for us when we got there -- very clutch on a hot Spring day in Austin.

Veronica was such a delightful and accommodating host and knows the ins and outs of Austin having lived here for 30+ years. I'd definitely recommend this house to anyone looking for a charming place to stay."
,,,,,,,, We really enjoyed our stay in this adorable neighborhood!  The place was comfy and well-stocked and Veronica made sure to check in to see if we needed anything.  She is a great host and knowledgeable about Austin. We appreciated the recommendations of restaurants and things to do! 
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was super welcoming!  Beginning with a lovely conversation when I arrived to dropping me off (in the rain) at a great restaurant the morning of my departure, she was both friendly and accommodating. 
I love the neighborhood, which reminds me of my own in Asheville, with its eclectic and interesting assortment of houses, both old and new. 
The little carriage house itself is a Bohemian hideaway -- homey, colorful, cosy and interesting, with just about everything you could possibly need. 
For me, it was a wonderful alternative to the conference hotel my colleagues were staying in."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's cottage is perfect for 3 or 4 people. The bedroom upstairs is very comfortable, as are the couches in the living room. Also, the grounds are beautiful! The garden/yard of both this cottage and Veronica's home are amazing and zen-like. This is  wonderful home base for people seeking to experience Austin from all angles - we enjoyed saying for Levitation (aka Austin Psych Fest) and Veronica was truly an amazing host with lots of information and insights not only into the local area, the festival etc; she also told us a lot about the music itself and clued us into the programming on the local radio station  (Austin's KUTX 98.9 - check it out!) which helped us learn even more about the bands we're going to see.

Thanks for the great time, Veronica! Hope to return again next year. :) "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a wonderful host! She made me and my girlfriend feel right at home. The location of the home was amazing. It was within walking distance of everything, from parks and pools, to downtown entertainment. The house was quaint and cozy, perfect for a couples getaway. We didn't want to leave! Thanks for everything Veronica. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's gorgeous cottage was the perfect spot for an Austin break. Set in a quiet, beautiful nature spot, it's close (10 min walk max) to the brilliant South Congress Ave full of quirky shops & eateries, a nice stroll say from Downtown & loads of excellent food trucks just 5 mins away. Veronica was there to give us a nice welcome & helpful recommendations. The main bed was comfy & our two friends who joined us for the break said the sofa-bed downstairs was really comfy too. There's air-con, toiletries & even coffee provided. I thoroughly recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"This house is the perfect little getaway!  It's comfortable, clean, and in a great neighborhood. We felt at home and had everything we needed (even coffee!). Everything was well maintained and functional.  We felt very safe and were close enough to SoCo, which was right where we wanted to be! Veronica was fantastic - not intrusive, very kind, helpful, and fun!  I would definitely stay here again and have already recommended the house to friends.     "
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I have to say, I honestly couldn't have asked for a better one. Veronica's cottage is amazing. My girlfriend and I were coming into Austin for a few days and requested the place on the same day as our arrival. Veronica was quick to respond, accept, and gave us detailed instructions on how the place works. It's absolutely charming and it's in a fantastic location too. Blocks away from S. Congress and Zilker Park. Getting anywhere you want to go is quick and easy from this place, and having a cozy loft to return home to gave us the ability to experience Austin like a couple of locals. Veronica is a great host and knows Austin so well. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Our group really enjoyed our stay in Austin. Veronica's place was just as advertised. The space was very clean, comfortable, and convenient. The location was absolutely perfect and within easy walking distance of everything we needed. I would highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was very welcoming, the neighborhood is great- walkable to everything we wanted to do during a wedding weekend visit. "
,,,,,,,,"Wow! What a great stay! I loved the funky retro furnishings. During the daytime, the house is full of sun; in the evening, there's a small patio area in front to enjoy a glass of wine and the night sky as you listen to the fountain splash. 
The location is terrific: about a half mile from Lady Bird Lake, and 1.5 miles from Whole Foods!
The hostess was laid-back and super-friendly. I appreciated the extra touches, like granola bars and yogurt in the kitchen. I hope to have a chance to visit again."
,,,,,,,,"It was great! Veronica was very sweet, and accommodating. The neighborhood is fantastic, and the cottage was perfect for us!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was an amazing host - so warm, helpful and fun to chat with.  The cottage is even better the pictures if you can imagine that - the ample sunlight, interior design and cozy layout were so Austiny and perfect.  When I checked in my first impulse was to just not leave and blow off SXSW!  I held all my work meetings there to share the charm with colleagues.  The location is excellent access to South Austin and downtown - Bouldin Creek is the place to be.  I highly recommend a stay here.    "
,,,,,,,,The house was very cool and everything was very easy. Thank you. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, we didn't drive the whole weekend. Veronica was super quick to respond to any questions. "
,,,,,,,,"Great house, great neighborhood, great hostess! We were very comfortable in this cozy loft and felt conveniently located to everything-- within 5-10 minute drive of all the Austin spots we wanted to check out. If the weather had been nicer, we probably could have walked many places! Veronica was very responsive, attentive, and helpful-- she even checked in to be sure we knew where the umbrella and heater were since it was unusually cold and rainy the weekend we were in Austin. Highly recommended spot!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was amazing.  Our trip was delayed due to snow in Philadelphia and when we arrived she had turned on the heaters in the cabin for us and met us outside to welcome us.  (So nice after a very, very long trip!)   If we were having coffee out front, she'd come to chat, but was never overbearing.  (We loved hearing her stories about Austin establishments and personalities!)

The space was cute as a button.  Absolutely perfect in every way!   It's my dream cabin.   The location is great too.  We walked to First and South Congress most evenings for eats / dancing (15 minutes), and the Broken Spoke was only a $8 Uber away (do go!).  

I was in town for a QuiltCon at the Convention Center and it took me about 30 minutes each day to walk there.   Whole Foods is close for necessities (and it's massive), as is the awesome river walkway around the ""lake.""  (If you are a runner, it's exactly an 11 mile loop around the lake and back to Veronica's!)   The location could not have been better for us.  (We live in a city so we're used to walking everywhere.  If you prefer to drive, parking is pretty easy.)

Veronica was awesome and he space was lovely.  Highly recommended and we'd stay there again without question if we're back in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's cottage is the perfect Austin retreat. It was perfectly situated in walking distance from South Congress, Zilker Park and even downtown if you don't mind a 30 minute stroll across Lady Bird Lake. City rental bikes are also just a few blocks away. Veronica was so sweet, providing us with amazing local recommendations -- she was there if we needed her, and gave us privacy as well. The cottage is homey, outfitted with a comfortable bed, great sheets and basic kitchen supplies. We loved our stay and will totally stay again the next time we are in town. We've stayed at many Airbnbs before - and many of them feeling transactional. Veronica's truly felt like a B&B. Recommend highly!"
,,,,,,,,Veronica was awesome.  We had arranged prior to drop off our luggage. She was just finishing cleaning the cute abode and gave us plenty of tips for the day. It is an awesome location and a super cool neighborhood. It is also very quiet. Very kitschy and clean. I highly recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"Veronica is a fabulous host. Responsive, friendly, and fun. The cottage is a perfect Austin experience. Cozy, funky, and a great location."
,,,,,,,,Veronica was very welcoming and the door code was quite convenient.  Driveway was shared so we would have appreciated knowing that in advance so we could park appropriately.  Front yard was not as commodious as pictured
,,,,,,,,This was a cool little bungalow and it met our expectations. Veronica was very helpful and went beyond her obligation to help us out with a few minor details.
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I wanted a nice stay in Austin for a few days close to downtown. I can't recommend this place enough. It seems small from the outside, but the two story loft was perfect for us, and it's so close to everything. 

Veronica's feedback was almost instantaneous, and she even gave some tips for exploring the town.

Wonderful stay, great location, great host. Can't recommend highly enough."
,,,,,,,,This place was lovely. The cottage was adorably decorated amid a charming setting. This was also the perfect location for the South Congress area (lots of fun shops & restaurants). Veronica was very friendly and helpful. 
,,,,,,,,"We had the best time at this place! Veronica was so helpful and welcoming. The cottage is homely and was perfect for our little christmas stay and there was more than enough room for the three of us. Definitely walkable distance from south congress, and in a very lovely area. hopefully we can come back one day!!! :)"
,,,,,,,,Great time awesome Neighborhood.
,,,,,,,,"This is is cozy place and retro, groovy and hip describe it quite accurately. Veronica was both accommodating and generous. The location is close to town and Austin is a prime place for both bike rentals as well as Uber taxis which cost us from $5 to $7 to get wherever we were going. Wifi is present but a little sketchy; you need to position yourself in a specific place to get access. It's fine for checking email but not if you plan on doing work. 
The large oak tree in the back is visible from the loft bed and absolutely beautiful - a great view through the window at night."
,,,,,,,,"What a lovely home base for touring Austin! The cottage is charming and very well appointed with many thoughtful touches to make your stay enjoyable. The garden is lovely with a splashing fountain and comfy chairs for relaxing. There is plenty of parking too. It's a great location in a quiet neighborhood. Veronica was very helpful and responsive. I highly recommend this eclectic, fun, cozy retreat for a true Austin experience."
,,,,,,,,"This hide-away spot in Austin's coolest neighborhood couldn't have been any more ideal.  It has really good energy from the moment you walk in the front door.  It's cozy and perfectly sized for one or two guests, but could also still easily accommodate a group of 8 or so friends hanging out (I imagine it even sleeps 3-5 with no problems thanks to fold out couches).  Veronica, the host, has lived in the next door building for decades and is incredibly nice, genuine, and all around lovely.  Any time I need a place to stay in the Bouldin Creek hood, I will most definitely be looking her up again!"
,,,,,,,,"I'll be back - a perfect, private get away - I was travelling for business and was able to walk downtown easily (about 15 mins). I never actually met Veronica as everything was super easy (keyless number entry) - I'd highly recommend this cute, clean and funky space."
,,,,,,,,Veronica's place was very well located! The house is quiet  and decorated in the true austin style. Perfect for a week end for 2 people!
,,,,,,,,"This place was very cute and Veronica was very nice, but you should probably have a car if you stay here. Especially if you aren't used to the heat. We spent a lot of time walking. It was at least a mile or two from everything we wanted to see. I would not consider it walking distance to downtown unless you really like to walk. It was a really cute and safe neighborhood with lots of young families. I think this place would be better for a couple than anyone needing more than one bed. The place was beautiful but not very comfortable for me. I would not recommend that an older person stay here due to the narrow steep stairs. It was close to the bus stop, which I would recommend taking. I was also confused by the outside picture. That is of the main house. I am a bit of a homebody who likes to be cozy on the couch and it wasn't really cozy. But it was beautiful and Veronica was nice."
,,,,,,,,Veronica was a great host and I have to say the loft was such a cool way to experience my first visit to Austin.  
,,,,,,,,"Stayed at this cute little cottage for 5 days in October and it was awesome. Very centrally located (walkable to South Congress, Downtown, etc). The place was clean, funky, and felt very ""Austin"". The kitchen and bathroom had everything you'd expect from a good rental house. Although the ceiling height was lower in certain areas, I never had any trouble with it (I'm 6'3""). Staying here made me feel like I was living like a local - a great place to stay for a first trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Me and my friends had great time staying in Veronica's cozy and modern loft. Loft was very clean and has great hip feel to it. It is very conveniently located from all points of interests. Veronica was very prompt in responding to my email and gave us useful tips as well. I also got to Veronica her for little bit when we were leaving. I would definitely stay there again when I am in Austin again.
,,,,,,,,The cottage/loft was perfect for ACL as it is easy walking distance to Zilker Park.  It's also right in the mix with South Congress.  I would definitely stay here again when I return to Austin.  Vernoica was a great hostess and always helpful in offering places to check out and ways to avoid traffic.
,,,,,,,,"Great place and located in a very convenient area of Austin. Loved being in a residential area, but close enough to walk to downtown, S. Congress and S. 1st areas. The loft was very clean and had everything we needed. It was a busy weekend and this was a perfect place to come back for some relaxation. We enjoyed our stay very much!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's place was great. The neighborhood was very nice. We enjoyed walking to 6th Street, Rainey Street, Zilker Park, and South Congress from her place. There is no need for a vehicle if you enjoy walking. The house was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I would stay here again. It was very relaxing."
,,,,,,,,"This is my second stay at Veronica's place, although this time in the cottage/loft. Loved it. Can't recommend highly enough. Great location in Austin too. One of the favourite places I have stayed on AirBnB "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica is such a wonderful host! She had everything perfectly organized when we arrived and was a perfect communicator throughout. The place is funky, cool and in an amazing location in Austin. If you're looking to feel like you're a local, stay at this cool place. Also, the water feature/living pond is so amazing. Wifi worked well. There is a little TV, but we didn't turn it on. If you came to Austin to watch TV it's kind of missing the point isn't it? Anyway, Thank you Veronica!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica stepped in when a previous reservation fell through do to legal issues. She was very attentive, and quick with her communications. 
While she was out of the country during our visit that attention was carried over by her friend and house sitter Jo. 

Location, Location, Location; the listing and photos are accurate and the location in a rapidly gentrifying treelined neighborhood is wonderful. BUT beware, the kitchen is more fun than functional. If you are using the site as more of a hotel room and eating out at the numerous close by restaurants it will be a wonderful visit. 

Do note the stairs are steep and the treads are small surfaces (only while desending) so it might not be the best for the physically challenged- or heavy drinker!

A very fun encapsulation of the funky trendy town Austin promotes..."
,,,,,,,,"Great location for visiting central Austin, especially Zilker/Barton/S. 1st.  Veronica is a helpful, gracious host.  "
,,,,,,,,The listing is very accurate.   The house is centrally located so we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. It was a very nice place to stay. 
,,,,,,,,"The place was very cool and comfortable! Great neighborhood with easy access to the food trucks on South First and the restaurants on South Congress. 
"
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I were visiting Austin over 4th of July weekend and wanted to experience the local flavor so we decided to rent a local's place. Veronica's cottage was super cute, and had everything we needed. Easily accommodated both of us. Quiet, safe neighborhood - as two females we felt very comfortable walking around.The location of her place was perfect for everything we wanted to do. It was a short walk to the South Congress area, and close to lots of great food and sights (it was a little TOO close to Gourdough's Doughnuts in fact!) :)

Would definitely rent again when visiting Austin!  

 "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Veronica's cottage.  We were out most of the time so didn't meet in person but she was very responsive to our questions and preparations.  The place was clean, interesting, and comfortable. The location was great to access the areas we were going in South Austin and downtown.  Happily would recommend to others and will return when we can. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"This was the first time we had used Airbnb.  We met Veronica the morning after our first nights stay.  Charming, friendly lady.  The cottage was clean and inviting.  My wife and I were in and out  so we did not spend much time at the cottage.  The neighborhood is quiet and lush with trees and greenery.  Very close to South Congress and Lamar, both streets with a lot happening.  I would consider staying here on our net visit to Austin if it is available."
,,,,,,,,"We rented this house the day before and Veronica was extremely quick to reply and answer all our questions. When we arrived, we thought we were renting a house, but it's really a converted garage next to the owner's main home. Not a big deal, but it wasn't clear in the photos. 

The cottage itself is cool and funky which is a style we like. Had great AC and hot water shower. Bed was super comfortable. We prepared most of our meals in the full kitchen (saves us money). We easily parked right outside our door.

The best part of the cottage is the neighborhood in South Austin. We loved walking around looking at all the renovated houses along the tree covered streets. Zilker Park is a short walk. We had a great afternoon at Barton Springs ($3 pass). Downtown is about 1.5 mile walk over the bridge (its close people). There's also a public bike stand close buy to rent bikes with a credit card. 

Veronica is really the best part of the package. She knows the city and is cool/friendly. She gave us plenty of privacy/space, but we were knew she was close by if we needed anything. We'd stay again for sure. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica and the house are both lovely! I felt immediately at home, as though in a super-hip version of my grandparents' house! Veronica's style and her hospitality are hard to beat."
,,,,,,,,"This is the second time we stayed with Veronica. It's a great place to stay for a couple, with a 10 minute walk to the fun end of South Congress Ave. We love the simplicity and nice touches such as water bottles in the fridge and recycling bins. 

Had a nice chat to Veronica too, very welcoming and full of knowledge of the area. Had a great stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a truly wonderful host; warm, welcoming, engaging and informative. We arrived to wine and beer (perfect!) and an introduction to the area. The cottage was wonderful! It's set in a leafy, eclectic, artistic garden setting (with pond) that was a joy to experience. At night the frogs sang us to sleep and we woke up feeling like we were in a tree house (the bed is by two large windows on the second floor) listening to birdsong. I haven't slept so well in ages. It's a perfect size for two (but could fit more), with a lovingly furnished interior filled with vintage treats that's fun to explore in itself. The location is perfect for discovering Austin. A lovely walk (by a creek and tree lined homes) to some great restaurants on 1st and buzzing South Congress, or north to the riverwalk and  downtown. There's plenty of car2go and bus options  if you don't have a car - including to the airport (about a 20 min walk to the 100 airport bus). It's also a great place to work (great wifi and a tranquil spot) if you have to, hopefully you don't :) The perfect introduction to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"
This is an adorable cottage in a wonderful garden setting, convenient and yet in a quiet residential setting.  Everything was comfortable, attractive and fun! Veronica is a kind and caring hostess who was easily available for our every request. I highly recommend this cottage to anyone who wishes to have a fabulous Austin experience! "
,,,,,,,,As described a retro groovy cottage. Absolutely charming.
,,,,,,,,Warm reception by the host! Nice little apartment in a green area of Austin. Best of all: it is in walking distance of both South and Downtown Austin bars and restaurants.  We loved the fact that there is a private seating area in the garden. And I spotted a  hummingbird on the morning we left... doesn't leave much to be desired. We would certainly like to stay here again
,,,,,,,,"This place is indeed Retro Groovy and hip.  The location is fabulous, the amenities are great, and the place is incredibly comfortable and well-appointed.  Couldn't ask for a better place to chill and relax, and it's a great home-base for downtown and South Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's loft is nice and quiet and a clean, quirky place to stay in Austin. It was exactly as described (it's a loft next to the main residence on the property) and was perfect for my wife and I as a little home base in Austin for a few days. There is a parking spot available to guests right out front so that was nice. We were also able to easily walk to many places nearby."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's cottage was wonderful. It's located within walking distance to Zilker Park, restaurants on s 1st street, and downtown (okay some of these are about a mile or so walk, so that may be stretching it for some people). It's close to just about everything, yet on a nice, quiet street. Veronica is a great host, making sure we were comfortable and knew how things in the cottage worked. The cottage itself was beautifully and eclectically decorated, cozy, and comfortable. I stayed there with my wife and 4 month old daughter for 4 nights, and we loved it. When I come back to Austin, I'll definitely try to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time in Austin and I LOVED it! Veronica'a cottage was clean, perfect location, and Veronica was a great host! Everything that was listed in the description was at the cottage. It is in a great neighborhood within walking distance to just about everything! Thank you Veronica!

"
,,,,,,,,"It's a lovely place and Veronica is a lovely person. It's an old working class neighborhood which is changing fast. You can walk down to the Colorado River and hang out on the pedestrian bridge, which is really nice at night. Coffee shop up the street. The sound of trains at night. I was enchanted."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in this cute little house. For 2 people it is perfect. We enjoyed all the space we had, it is definitely much more relaxed to stay in this house than to stay in a hotel room (which were much more expensive in the time of our visit). It's a 25 min walk downtown, but there are many buses (costs are only 1 dollar) so it's convenient. We enjoyed being able to make tea and to have some breakfast (Veronica provided some delicious oatmeal). The shower is nice too. I would definitely recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,Great host & great location.  Veronica made my SXSW 2014 a very memorable one.  I would def rent again. 
,,,,,,,,What a beautifully decorated cottage and such gracious hosts - this is a pad that will get you into the Austin vibe in 5 seconds and keep you there for as long as you're lucky to stay!
,,,,,,,,"Veronica and her place are lovely!  Thanks for providing a nice place to weather a few cold, rainy days.  "
,,,,,,,,"Veronicas cottage was so cozy,comfortable and quiet. It is in a great neighborhood and is conveniently located to everything. We walked everywhere or rented bikes from the very convenient bike share program Austin has. We didn't even need a car to explore this great town. I will definitely be coming back and if Veronicas cottage is available I would definitely rent it again. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful time staying in Veronica's Cottage! It was perfect for all of our needs. The cottage was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful--great trees, chirping birds, and Veronica's lush patio and garden. It was very convenient to walk to 1st, Lamar, and Congress to walk downtown or grab a bus. There were a few places we had planned to go to that were not super accessible by public transportation, so we ended up renting a car from Enterprise, which was 0.5 miles from Veronica's. Parking on the street would have been super easy, but Veronica had a spot for us--which was great! Such a wonderful host--almost like staying at an Aunt's you have never met. We felt very much at home and are looking forward to our next trip to Austin and Veronica's! "
,,,,,,,,"I've visited Austin many times before, but I'm now convinced I'd never really experienced the real Austin until my stay at Veronica's.  Veronica and her cottage are an authentic slice of what gives Austin its funky soul, and sets it apart from the rest of the state.

The cottage was a clean, cozy, and charmingly decorated little space with some high ceilings and lots of light that make it feel open and airy.  Overall, the photographs accurately depict the grounds, space, and decor.  

The neighborhood was very quiet, the only exception being the occasional train horn that was just loud enough to be charming.  Many things to do within walking distance, but be prepared for a moderate walk to get out of the neighborhood and over to S. Congress.

For the technically minded who may be curious I can report that there was good data coverage in the cottage with Sprint (4G LTE), Verizon and AT&T.

On future visits to Austin, I'll definitely be checking availability with Veronica first!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 50 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,We absolutely loved the Retro Groovy and Hip Cottage/Loft. The location was close to great restaurants and coffee shops. It was walkable and easy to get to 6th Street and South Congress.  We will definitely try to stay here again if ever in Austin. Veronica was so sweet and accommodating. Two thumbs up!
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this cool little cottage. Austin is a great city and this place is in a perfect location.  Great neighborhood, off street parking, comfy bed - and fun dÃ©cor!  Veronica is a great hostess - we had fun chatting.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a fun place to stay in a safe and eclectic neighborhood. "
,,,,,,,,"I rented Veronica's cozy cottage for my daughter and her husband for the honeymoon getaway they never had. The transaction was seamless for all of us.  Laura and John absolutely loved the cottage, it's style and it's location in Austin.  I think they were actually sad to leave.  Thank you Veronica....we'll be back.  I have another daughter who lives in Austin and will be visiting soon. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, Veronica was a great host. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,Veronica's cottage was exactly as described.  It was peaceful and private and a wonderful place to use as a home base while exploring Austin.  I'd highly recommend it!
,,,,,,,,"I couldn't imagine a better place to stay than Veronica's cottage.  The space was cozy yet spacious, incredibly charming, and so conveniently close to all that Austin has to offer.  The neighborhood itself was something to see, so unique and diverse.  Veronica herself was incredibly helpful both in our conversions online and in person, and even personally delivered an Austin Chronicle to our doorstep to help us plan our trip.  We can't wait to return to this awesome city, and when we do, we will definitely stay here, or in one of her other properties.  "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's place has got to be one of the coolest places to stay in Austin.  It's much better than a hotel and it's got great character and charm that makes your trip to Austin even more special.   In fact, its one of those places that makes you thrilled to come home to!   Plus its spotless and Veronica is an outstanding host.   

It's just south of the river so if you want to be near the hip side of town, you are at the right place.  About a 15 minute walk to S Congress, plus she even provides a parking space if you need to get there or anywhere else in town by carâ€¦.thanks Veronica for a pleasant stay."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's cottage was exactly as advertised. Easy to book and coordinate with ahead of time. Clean and spacious. Great location. Veronica was full of good tips on music, bbq, and Austin in general- both ahead of time and in person. Had a very useful selection of magazines with good articles on things around town to supplement conversations. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, lovely host. Wish I had been there in warm months to enjoy the inviting outdoor space. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for me.  I walked just about everywhere, I loved the location/neighborhood and Veronica's little cottage was very clean and comfortable.  The bed in the loft was extremely comfortable.  I definitely recommend this cool little place.  I hope to return soon."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great weekend staying in this cute cottage. 20 mins casual walk through the neighbourhood to South Congress with Home Slice Pizza (best pizza in Austin) and to the shopping/food. 10 mins walk to Torchy's Tacos (also recommended).

Check in and out was simple and hassle free. We bumped into Veronica on our way out and she was very helpful and a pleasure to chat with. Would definitely recommend this cottage for a quiet night in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"This rental is in a great location and is very quiet and private. Lots of windows with great top down- bottom up shades. Outside temp quite chilly while I was there but the place is so well insulated, I never had to turn on the heat.  It is a very eclectic, laid back space full of interesting things. Veronica is welcoming and responsive. I am booked to stay at the property again. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was so friendly and the place was fantastic.  Great location in Austin, and just a wonderful weekend!  "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay! Clean, fun and has everything you need! Veronica was great help and a great host! Would definitely go back!"
,,,,,,,,This is a super cute place to stay.  It was very close to downtown and all of the other cool places to be.  I hope to stay there again.
,,,,,,,,Great little place!  Very cute and close to all the action!
,,,,,,,,"What a beautiful cottage! It was perfect for my friend and I, who were in Austin for ACL. I stayed in the bed upstairs, which was huge and very comfortable, and my friend stayed on one of the two beds downstairs. It was only a 20-minute walk from Zilker Park, and a few blocks from South 1st and South Congress (including Torchy's Tacos - a must-do!). The kitchen was well-stocked with a coffee-maker, tea bags, and oatmeal - with a real stove if we'd ever needed it - and the whole place was very comfortable and homely. Will definitely stay again next time I'm in Austin! It was really easy to get to and from the airport as well - just a short walk to the 100 bus stop, and if you want to get downtown there's a number 5 stop virtually outside the door."
,,,,,,,,"This was a great, quiet space to relax and feel like you're away from things a bit and on vacation, while only being a few blocks from S. Congress or the 1st St bridge to Downtown. Veronica was a gracious host and made sure I had what I needed during my stay."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's cottage/loft is a true Austin experience with the perfect combination of comfort, character and convenience!  Veronica met us as we arrived with a smile, a friendly greeting and offer to provide any help we needed.  She's a wonderful host with a fabulous property and I highly recommend her lovely place if you're visiting Austin for business or pleasure.  The location is absolutely wonderful -- in a beautiful neighborhood close to Barton Springs, Zilker Park, great restaurants and fabulous music.  The loft had everything we needed and I loved the creative, colorful decor.  Will definitely stay with Veronica again if I get the chance!  Thank you so much for a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at Veronica's cottage. The space is amazing, in the middle of a lovely, quiet neighborhood, and perfectly situated near South Congress, Zilker Park, Barton Springs and downtown. 

We can't wait to stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a fantastic hostess and gave us a perfect first air bnb experience. She was very responsive and was friendly.  This loft was great for me and my girlfriend, providing just the right amount of privacy but also accessibility to Veronica should we need something. The loft itself was ""very cute"", in my girlfriend's words, and provided more than enough room for two people, although it can probably fit up to four. It was conveniently located a short walk away from south congress, as well as downtown Austin. Highly recommend Veronica and this spot!"
,,,,,,,,"Although Veronica was out of town and we were unable to meet her, she provided convenient and prompt correspondence via email. The loft was hip and cozy--and my parents tell me the bed upstairs was ""a dream!"" It was so nice to have a full kitchen with a stove and refrigerator available. The loft was clean, bright, enjoyable, and decorated well. The restaurant right down the street is close and delicious! Zilker park is right there.  I recommend staying here! :)"
,,,,,,,,"The location of the loft is unbeatable. So close to parks, good food, running trails, and an easy to drive to other parts of Austin. The neighborhood and space are quiet, lovely, and a perfect getaway. I especially enjoyed all of the great seating and the comfortable bed. A great place to stay in Austin that gives you the neighborhood feel yet is close to everything!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location! Superb owner! I grew up in Austin, and Bouldin Creek is one of the best places in the city to stay - close to everything - hike & bike trail, Barton Springs, Lady Bird Lake, South Congress Ave, 6th St, etc. And Veronica is a true Austinite: friendly, warm, a wealth of local music knowledge she's happy to share, and a joy to chat with. The cottage is perfect for a couple or even if you have a child, and there's an awesome yard to chill in, sit, swing on the great tree swing and sip on a cold Shiner Bock. "
,,,,,,,,"The place is beautiful, the size is perfect, the furniture and the art in the house makes an awesome experience to be at the groovy loft.

Veronica was very nice and helpfull! She is a very interesting person who knows about a lot of stuffs.

We will definitly going back to Austin and going back to Veronica's place."
,,,,,,,,Veronica was nice and very helpful. Her cottage is cute and it has everything you might need. It's also in a good location. It's a long but pleasant walk to the downtown area from her cottage. Great experience overall. 
,,,,,,,,"Staying Veronica's loft was a treat. It's not only nestled in a quiet and picturesque Bouldin Creek neighborhood that is close to many popular destinations in Austin, the loft offered nice respite after a day of activity. It has a cute and unique retro charm with modern touches, and you can see that Veronica paid attention to the details which made the experience even more pleasant for us. There are some rougher/edgy finishes, but that only adds to the charm. Veronica was a wonderful host and made herself available if we needed anything. My husband and I didn't have a car, but we managed by walking to many key places within a mile (often less) from the loft.

In summary, the loft was clean, private, quiet, and a place I would stay at again (even if I am in town again by myself). "
,,,,,,,,"I just love it! Second time we've stayed here. So close to the everything, great neighborhood and Veronica is GREAT!  We'll be back soon!"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a perfect host, and the place was just what I was looking for: peaceful, fun, and convenient. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Veronica was a very friendly and helpful host. The cottage was quiet and clean. All in all we had a very pleasant stay. We would certainly  recommend it to others.
,,,,,,,,"My husband & I loooved this loft! It is so cute & cozy. And it is within walking distance of South Congress & Barton Springs pool if you are willing to do a little walking. But after all of the Texas BBQ, some walking is definitely not a bad idea! Veronica was wonderful. She was always available and was willing to accommodate some special requests that I had. I would definitely stay there again if I were going back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a great host to my travelers! She was easy to communicate and schedule arrangements with and I never worried about anything. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay at her adorable loft. 
"
,,,,,,,,"This place is simply gorgeous. We were so pleased with our stay! Located in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood within walking distance to 1st street and South congress. It really felt like a home from home! Veronica is a great host, very kind an easygoing. Love to come back some other time. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay with Veronica! Very cute place, great location, would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Five stars, I'd give Veronica and her property six if I could. The loft was comfortable, quiet, clean and spacious, as well as significantly more cost-efficient than some of the hotels in town, but equally as hip and interesting. The location of the cottage/loft is on a quiet residential street, but easily walking distance from the main drag of South Congress, and some of my new favorite places on First Street; parking is included, as well. Veronica is a very kind, welcoming and hospitable host. Missing this place and Austin already and can't wait to return one day soon."
,,,,,,,,"With the PaleoFX 2013 conference happening at the Palmer Center, this cute little cottage house was located just one-third of a mile up the hill. Most of the other attendees were in a hotel nearly a mile away from the event. This is a central location and within walking distance of most places you would want to visit.

The loft itself was pretty good. That big bed upstairs was amazing and I slept great. There's a second bed downstairs my roommate enjoyed with comfort. There are a few interesting noises you'll hear late at night/early in the morning like a train whistle or the occasional car driving by, but it's mostly pretty quiet.

There was only one incident that happened on the final night of my visit. I heard a gnawing sound downstairs around 5AM and went to investigate. When I didn't see anything, I tried going back upstairs to sleep but was again awakened by the gnawing sound. When I went back downstairs, I could see where a mouse had gotten on top of the refrigerator and thrown down on my almond butter and dark chocolate. EWWWW!

To her credit, Veronica did email me to apologize and asked what she could do. She is getting an electronic mouse exterminator thingy installed in the rooms. I didn't get much sleep that last night (about 4 hours) and the cost of the food I lost to the rodent was about $15. I'm not gonna fret about it, but it put a sour end to what was otherwise a great place to stay while you're in Austin, TX."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was great- friendly without being obtrusive.  The place is well kept and in a great quiet, picturesque location convenient to downtown and the south congress area.  The check-in with keyless entry was so convenient."
,,,,,,,,"Very responsive by email, phone and text. Great location"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's location is the best. We were walking distance from SOCO and other areas of interest.  Veronica's cottage has lots of room, lots of light, and a comfortable bed. The kitchen is nicely appointed. The decorations in the cottage are inspirational and delightful. It was a great stay."
,,,,,,,,"very cute place and clean. we really enjoyed our stay.
Veronica was very friendly in giving us recommendations."
,,,,,,,,Really enjoyed our stay in the cute little cottage. The amenities are comfortable and the location is outstanding. Veronica is a delightful and friendly host. Will definitely go back!
,,,,,,,,"Visited Veronica's cottage while taking some time away from work..and well..life.  I couldn't have found a better place.  It was just as described, groovy..and hip.  Most of the items throughout the space I could only visualize how they came to be where they were.  

The place was quite warm, quiet, and just what we needed..relaxing.  "
,,,,,,,,"If you think crumbling sheetrock, questionable electric wiring, dirty pans in the cupboard, dust and greasy finger marks everywhere, used bars of handsoap in a dish by the sink,  etc. add up to ""groovy and hip""  then this place is for you. 
Staying for 5 nights, I asked for some clean towels, and a sheet that would actually FIT the bed; but Veronica balked at complying with these and other simple requests. Since I had booked for 5 nights, and the cancellation policy was ""strict "",  I decided to tough it out. Unfortunately, it  got from bad to worse.
 There was a dead possum in the yard the next morning, and Veronica placed it in the garbage can outside the front door of the loft. After a couple of days the stench was so bad you had to hold your nose going in and out of the place, and couldn't open any windows because of  the awful smell just outside the front door.
If your looking for a clean, habitable place with an accomodating host, pass this one by."
,,,,,,,,"Veronica was a lovely host.  We were in Austin for the Formula One car race and the town was packed. Veronica's place is on a quiet street just south of downtown.  The cottage stand alone and is quite large, with a loft for the bed and bathroom.  The only caveat is that he loft stairs are very steep and uneven but we had no problem negotiating them. The kitchen had full sized appliances that were serviceable, if not the most modern.   Veronica has WiFi but no cable or satellite TV.  

All in all, a good host and place. "
,,,,,,,,"Veronica is amazing and so is the house. The place is so cute and comfy, and in a perfect location. We were in walking distance of South Congress and Auditorium shores. Downtown is walkable just a bit farther.  The location is very private and extremly quite and super peacful!Thank you Veronica!!"
,,,,,,,,"We came to Austin for a weekend trip and loved staying in the Loft. The house was cozy and a nice mixture of old and new. It is close to the park, downtown, South Congress/S.1st and next visit I will not rent a car. Veronica responded quickly to emails and there were no surprises."
,,,,,,,,We had an execellent time in the cottage! Veronica was very helpful and friendly and we could not have had a better host. Will come back next time we are in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Veronica's place was very comfortable and convenient. I really liked the neighborhood and my daily hikes to and from Zilker park as I attended three days of ACL.. I thought it was amazing how she converted an old garage into such a cute and functional little living space. Gave me some good ideas. 
,,,,,,,,"The good stuff first: the place is adorable, the host, Veronica, and her daughter (who we met on our way out) are super sweet and friendly, there's tons of beautiful sunlight that comes into the cottage, there was beer in the fridge and the location CAN NOT be beat: you're a 1-2 mile walk to almost everything in downtown and there's parking space if you're renting a car. I stayed with my girlfriend and it was the perfect amount of room for a couple, with a full bathroom and kitchen and queen bed.

Our only complaint (and the reason for 4/5 instead of 5/5 stars) is the price felt a bit too high for no TV and no internet (I was there for a technology conference, wireless internet would have been REALLY helpful)."
,,,,,,,,"Really cute and cozy place, perfect for a couple, and in a great location! "
,,,,,,,,"I had a wonderful visit to Austin staying in this gorgeous loft home.   It was on a quiet street, and only a short walk from South Lamar and the Alamo Drafthouse where I was spending all my time.   Yet it felt remote, cozy, relaxing even though it was in the middle of everything.  The bed was comfortable, the shower had great pressure and plenty of hot water, and the place was incredibly spacious.  Also Veronica was a pleasure to deal with along the way.  I would absolutely stay there again and recommend anyone book the place. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience.  Great host, great place, great location!  Easy walk to SoCo, Zilker Park and more. We highly recommend Veronica's place."
,,,,,,,,"Lovely cottage, great location"
,,,,,,,,"Veronica's place was perfect. The location, the funky decor, the comfy bed and all the privacy one could want, with a friendly hostess to boot. I would definitely come back to Veronica's place the next time I'm in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Veronica's cottage loft is adorable and it was absolutely perfect for our stay in Austin! A perfect example of quirky/fun Austin. Veronica was very extremely nice and welcoming. I would 100% stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Veronica is a doll, and the cottage is a gem!  We absolutely loved it.  It was perfect for couple of girlfriends enjoying Austin for the weekend.  Location is excellent: close to Barton Springs and SoCo.  Decor is fab and bed was very comfortable (as well as the sleeper on the first floor)."
,,,,,,,,"We ended up booking this place very last minute and couldn't have been happier! Beautiful garden landscape leading up to the front door : ) Highly recommend, wonderful location!"
,,,,,,,,"First off, if you are looking for a cool little place to stay, near all of the South Austin hot spots look no further.  Book this wonderfully eclectic slice of Austin cool today.  My buddy and I visited Austin for a recent car show, and needed a safe place to park our classic vehicle, Veronica was very accommodating and made space available to us.  Her place is amazing to say the least; the decor was a classic twist on cool, very retro, clean, and comfortable.  I will be returning to Austin next year and am looking forward to staying with her again.  By the way, she was a great host; we would see her daily in her garden or out on South Congress, very nice and super cool!

Thanks Veronica, see you soon!

,,,,,,,,"Wife and I had a great stay.  The location is very convenient to many of the popular neighborhoods and sites in Austin.  Zilker Park is a very short walk, Lady Bird Lake is about a mile away, and downtown is a short drive over the bridge.  The host met us at check in, and he was super friendly.  He was also responsive on text to any questions we had. The apartment was clean and comfortable, and the space was private even with the shared living room.  Would gladly stay again next time we are in Austin."

,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Tankersley's place exceeded our expectations! He communicated with us that he would not be at the apartment when we arrived and sent a detailed explanation on how to get the keys and check in. Everything was very clean when we arrived and his place is beautiful. Plenty of space for the two of us, large walk in closet and bathroom attached to the bedroom, all the basic toiletries were available including shampoo/conditioner, body wash, blow dryer, extra towels, etc. Also had basic kitchen supplies so we were able to make breakfast. Really felt like we were at home. The location was perfect and only a short walk to Zilker park and downtown Austin. Would definitely stay here again!"

,,,,,,,,Great place to stay. Super convenient to go to 6th st. Host did a great job of being responsive and accommodating for our stay.
,,,,,,,,"It was my birthday weekend and I had a place prior to this listing that cancelled on me the week of my trip. Air B&B recommend a beautiful condo with an amazing view to accommodate me,in such short notice. The people at top trip rentals were so awesome they responded quickly,were very thorough on their information,  and made me feel comfortable.  On my arrival they left little details that made my birthday that much more special. The place is spacious,clean, comfortable, and the convenience that it's right on 6th st. Made it just right for my group and I to enjoy our weekend at Austin. Will definitely be staying here again."

The apartment was big and spacious. My two issues with the apartment is that #1.) there is no door in the second bedroom, no privacy at all! It's a bunk bed which is open to the hall entrance. #2.) the master bedroom opens to the bathroom, and it is separated by a weird sliding door, no privacy! You can hear everything. Overall good experience with Airbnb though, I liked the communication. "
,,,,,,,,"Nathan's apartment is in a very convenient location. Close to plenty of food choices, downtown and easy access to highways.

,,,,,,,,"The location is about a 15-20 min walk to east 6th street. 
The building is fine. 
Nathan was not completely organized upon meeting us. 
The space was fine but the downside was that it smelled like smoke and our clothes absorbed the smell. We didn't care a lot but it was just kind of annoying. "
,,,,,,,,"There were just 3 of us guys who needed a clean, safe and easy place to stay during our convention. It fulfilled our needs with the exception of not having a dedicated Wi-Fi to the unit. The listing did say 3 rooms but only has 2. After departure, we've given Nathan some suggestions for improvement and it sounds like he's definitely going to implement them for future guests. Also, at this time, there was only 1 key/fob so we had to be strategic about coming and going with the 3 of us having different agendas. I'd stay here again if the unit was available the next time I'm in town."
4194853,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great location getting around the city, noise from 6th street actually wasn't that bad at all."
,,,,,,,,"I absolutely loved my stay! Location is perfect, walkable to all of downtown Austin. The unit was exactly as pictured and extremely spacious. My flight was delayed and I ended up arriving much later than expected, but it was no issue since the team had already sent me my code to the building and unit. Loved the fact that no keys were involved, eliminating the need for any check-in/check-out process. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing experience with this Airbnb.
The perpetration from the host was amazing and the apartment is located on a great sport.
When I would come back to Austin I would rent it again.
We liked it a lot, also that we didnâ€™t need keys.
Thanks so much
"
,,,,,,,,I had a great experience! The pictures are accurate and the location is perfectly located on dirty 6th. It was a bit noisy since we were there in Halloween weekend but that was expected. 
,,,,,,,,Fantastic experience in a great location!
,,,,,,,,Great place. Awesome location downtown. Great communication. 
,,,,,,,,I have never been so pleased with a stay! I was greeted with a Happy Birthday Card that lifted my spirits! It was truly a very nice place to stay. I highly recommend this loft. It was in the heart of Downtown and steps away from amazing tourist sites.  
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin and the City Loft location was perfect for exploring the area.  We parked our car and explored Sixth Street, the Rainey District, the Warehouse district and South Congress.  We stayed over a Saturday night that UT had a home game and thought we might need to use the earplugs the host supplied but the noise was not a problem.  I loved sitting on the balcony and enjoying the view all times of the day!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was perfectly situated right in the heart of downtown with easy access to pretty much anything. Communication was great, and I love being able to come and go as we please without any physical keys. I highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,fantastic communication and support!   great location...their team is really well put together.  
,,,,,,,,"Great communication and the place was in a great spot, just as described"
,,,,,,,,The loft was perfect for our trip.  We wanted to stay close to the downtown for a group of us on a bachelor weekend.  The location was perfect and getting in was very easy using a keypad.   Clean and convenient!
,,,,,,,,Our host was very easy to work with. As for the loft the location is awesome! I woukd stay there again for sure.
,,,,,,,,"I loved this place! It's perfectly located, spacious and super clean. My friends and I were road tripping across America and Austin was unanimously everyone's favorite city and this place most definitely weighted to this conclusion. "
,,,,,,,,My experience with TopTrip Rentals was far and above what I expected it to be. It was my first time using AirBnb and they made sure I knew everything that I needed to know in order to have a smooth experience. Their instructions were clear and easy to understand. The place was spotless upon arrival. The location was perfect. And finding available parking relatively close to the complex was simple. 10/10 experience across the board and I definitely plan on booking through Top Trip Rentals again. 
,,,,,,,,Everything was accurate
,,,,,,,,"Chereen and her team were great -- very responsive and accommodating. They are professional and incredibly organized -- all the necessary information and detailed instructions regarding the apartment is emailed in advance and/or printed and documented in the black folder on the dining table. Parking passes were also available for a price which was convenient and provided us some peace of mind, because we didn't know Austin's parking situation. I loved that the apartment access was granted by an access code, it allowed my large group of friends to split up and head back at our leisure without coordinating keys. Chereen also allowed us to check out at 3:30pm instead of the usual 11am, which I really appreciated. 

The apartment itself was great -- clean, modern, comfy. All amenities were provided and the prime location served us very well. We loved being walking distance from 6th street in the heart of downtown! Walking to the clubs on Saturday night took us literally one minute.  

The only complaint I have is that it was slightly troublesome to read over and sign an extra rental agreement outside of AirBnB, especially because the clauses about the deposit and key collection are not applicable. Also, the toilet had some flushing issues while we were there but I'm sure Chereen and her team will fix that for future guests. 

Overall this place was amazing, and I will definitely rent from Top Trip Rentals again. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time! Convenient location, beautiful place, easy parking and they even had snack for us upon arrival! Can't wait to come back."
,,,,,,,,"This location is wonderful, it is right in the heart of downtown Austin and located very close to many of the attractions of the area. The loft itself is beautiful. A large dining area with room to sit six comfortably, a wonderful view of Sixth Street, a kitchen with everything needed to prepare meals, and ample comfortable sleeping space for a few people. This location is perfect for the family or business traveler. Top Trip Rentals helped make my journey simple and enjoyable. "
,,,,,,,,"Great spot.  Nice modern apartment in a high rise building.  They have lots of units in the building.  Good amenities, and could not be more centrally located.  Communication was solid."
,,,,,,,,Great first time experience using Air BnB! All instructions were clear and each question was answered in a timely manner. The location was exceptional along with the loft. We were very pleased with everything and definitely would love to rent this loft again! 
,,,,,,,,"Right on 6th street, perfect location. 
Very clean and confortable. 
Would definitely come back and recommend."
,,,,,,,,"The condo was great and a very easy process. The location downtown has easy access, but it's very, very loud at night. The description has full disclosure about the noise and ear plugs were provided.  Overall a very good experience but we likely would choose something a block or two off Sixth Street next time."
,,,,,,,,"Hosts were very helpful and responded immediately to any questions I have.
The condo was great-  nice view of 6th and truly in the heart of everything!"
,,,,,,,,Great place in the center of Austin. Key code option was a plus so everyone had access and not limited by keys. 
,,,,,,,,"Communication from Top Trip Rentals was great! They provided everything ahead of time and made sure we were well prepared to check-in. The location was perfect and the access to discounted parking was convenient!

Only downside is having to complete the rental agreement and parking payment outside of AirBnb, but they warn about it in the description."
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment in an awesome location! The bars are less than 1 block away, it's literally across the road from the famous Driskill Hotel and everything else is practically walking distance! The room itself is very spacious, the kitchen is well equipped, beds are comfortable and it's got pretty much everything you need. Host was great, able to answer any questions and communication was a breeze."
,,,,,,,,"Located in the heart of downtown, literally on 6th street, this modern loft is ideal for anyone who is interested in exploring Austin. 

The unit can comfortably fit 4 adults, decoration in subtle but modern, kitchen is fully equipped, and the couch is ridiculously comfortable! It is important to remember that 6th St is Austin's bar scene, so expect to hear some music on weekend nights. 

A convenient keyless door system makes the experience easy and fast. Prior to arrival, guests are provided with a combination code for the keypad (both to the street door and the apartment door). 

Great place, I would definitely recommend it!"

,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay here.The apartments location is excellent no problems checking in/out. Was able to contact the hosts at any time the view was awesome beds were comfortable and clean. 
,,,,,,,,Great place in the center of town! Host left awesome local recommendations and snacks. Would definitely stay again if in Austin. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Muy buen departamento ubicado en el corazon de Austin, limpio con todo lo necesario para la estadia
"
,,,,,,,,Awesome spot in an awesome location! Beds are comfortable and the keyless entry was really nice since there were 5 of us!
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay! Easy to communicate with host and perfect location.  Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Very good location, right in the heart of things. An easy, short walk to the trails that run along the river.

"
,,,,,,,,"One of the best locations in Austin. Since it is centrally located you can walk to most anywhere in the downtown area (6th Street, Rainey Street, restaurants, grocery store, etc.). 

We stayed for ACL and it was just a cheap uber ride to and from the venue. Some nights we decided to walk back after the shows and it only took about 20 minutes. 

Would definitely book again for ACL/any extended stay in Austin. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Great location! Apartment is directly on 6th street, parking located next door which was very convenient. Great stay! Top trip made checking in and out easy-pain free! "
,,,,,,,,"Top Trip Rentals was fantastic... very accommodating and responsive. Apartment was clean, spacious, and very convenient to everything. I appreciated that they warned us about the layout and the noise (and even provided ear plugs). We rented three apartments from them, and they were all perfectly situated on the same floor. It was like we were in one big house so it suited our needs perfectly. We all enjoyed our stay very much. Thank you!

Only complaint would be laundry. My colleagues had trouble doing laundry as the washer (only 1!) and dryer were being used by housekeeping at, what seemed like, all hours of the day for almost a week."
,,,,,,,,"Top Trip's listing saved my bacon. Some major events on the weekends bookending my 2 night trip made downtown hotel rooms scarce or ridiculously expensive. This listing was conveniently located right across from the historic Driskell Hotel at a fraction of the cost. Coordination with Top Trip was clearly communicated ahead of time and went smooth as silk. This also included parking rental, which seems a bit daunting when you first the agreement, but makes perfect sense once you're on site.

Top Trip will mention this, but it must be stressed that the City Loft is *in the heart of downtown Austin*, not up in a high rise, and not soundproofed like a hotel. You are definitely in audio range of the 6th street music scene until well into the evening. The sounds of late night street activity will probably leak into your dreams. If you are a light sleeper plan on using earplugs (helpfully provided) or choose another listing.

The furnishings and decor were pedestrian but sufficient for me and my colleague. Cleanliness was top notch.  The walking convenience more than made up for  the lack of opulence. I highly recommend this listing especially if you are committed to activities in the downtown Austin area and I would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Cute loft apartment. Love that the television has a Roku so you can log into your own netflix account. You are on the corner of 6th street so you can hear the live music at night until about 2am, you'd be ok if you're a heavy sleeper. The bed is very soft. There were some bugs in the apartment. Otherwise, convenient location, walking distance to plenty of food. "
4759081,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Richard and Sara were perfect hosts ! The place is ideally located and they provided us with some really cool place nearby. The place is big and bright, and they really have attention for details ! 
Great place to stay in Austin - totally recommend !"
,,,,,,,,"This historic home provides a quintessential Austin experience.  Perfectly located near downtown, you can walk to great restaurants and groceries via tree lined residential streets. The space provides everything you need for a fine Texas visit and we will absolutely return to enjoy Richard and Sara's hospitality."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and host.  The space was perfect for a getaway and very accessible to public trans.  Plenty of room and nice touches like coffee, milk and sugar waiting for us.

Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Tip top accommodations. Charming in every way.
,,,,,,,,"We were so pleased with our stay!!  Very clean, great location, Richard and Sarah were very nice and very accommodating!  We would highly recommend this house!"
,,,,,,,,"Richard was in contact with us well before our reservation. His instructions were very clear, and we found everything as he said it would be. Richard dropped in to say hello and was wonderful in helping us get a taxi downtown to a live music venue. The place was exactly as it looks in the pictures, very spacious and clean. Short walk to everything you can need - cool liquor store, the Wholefoods and great places to eat. "
,,,,,,,,"The location was good, a quiet neighborhood with restaurants within a short walk.   "
,,,,,,,,"This is a beautiful small apartment in a historic home.  Amazing location - walking distance to Whole Foods, West Sixth AND all the restaurants and amenities of Clarksville/West Lynn.  Richard is an excellent host.  He genuinely cares about his guests.  He checks in from time to time, but lets you enjoy the space and the city on your own, as great.  This is a good space for professional travelers, OR for a couple on weekend.  My team rented both units, and we used the garage apartment for meetings during the days, as well."
,,,,,,,,Charming apartment and great hosts! Definitely would love to stay again.
,,,,,,,,Wow! What a great place and Richard was really helpful and gave us lots of great tips. The apartment was perfect and v clean and close in a lovely area. Will definitely recommend and can't wait to visit again. 
,,,,,,,,Great spot close to downtown Austin but very quiet. Richard was always available to address any minor issues we had. Has everything needed for a short or long stay. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Richard was very helpful all week. We didn't meet Sarah.
We were all made very welcome."
,,,,,,,,"Our hosts were very accommodating.  They were very responsive, which was probably the best part of our experience.  The actual space is beautiful and comfortable.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"It was very comfortable, very clean and spacious and had everything needed for my trip to Austin.  It's in a great location, easy to walk to restaurants, and the bed is as nice as any hotel! "
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara's home was very welcoming and comfortable. We were in town for just a few days for the football game, and this was the perfect location. Richard and Sara were quite accommodating and available if needed. We would love to stay at their home again for a future trip to Austin.  Thanks for a lovely visit!"
,,,,,,,,this is a very nice place to stay
,,,,,,,,"We were greeted upon arrival and made to feel at home. The neighbourhood is very congenial, with gracious homes. A short walk takes one to downtown with all manner of dining and entertainment close by as well as a very well appointed Whole Foods. Trader Joes is nearby, also.
The apartment is generously sized and had everything we needed for our stay. 
The home is an Austin landmark and this is reflected in the 12' ceilings and well-preserved original construction."
,,,,,,,,"The host were great!  It definitely worked for us in our time in Austin.  Just a  great place to stay that's easy, clean, comfortable, and centrally located.   Thanks for the hospitality :)"
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay. The location is very nice, lovely neighbourhood. We would have stayed longer if it were available. No complaints on this end!
"
,,,,,,,,"The neighbourhood was great: friendly, leafy and within easy walking distance of local and downtown shops, cafes and eating places. Our hosts made us feel very welcome and part of the family. The description was entirely accurate. The annex is part of a historic house with great character, high ceilings and very tastefully furnished. "
,,,,,,,,"Easy walking distance to everything, all the amenities were great and as described. Great for long or short-term stay. Like being at home. "
,,,,,,,,"Great little place, just as described. Lots of charm and close to everything. We were able to walk to a lot of popular spots, great restaurants and shopping. Very clean and the perfect amenities. Hosts were easily available for any questions, recommendations or needs. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect for my girlfriend and me. Had everything we needed and much more. Super close to everything. We rented a car and didn't even really use it. We were able to walk everywhere. Would stay again.
,,,,,,,,"This place rocks. It's nestled in a separate apartment on the side of a cool house (separate entrance and plenty of privacy but you don't feel so so alone). There's a beautiful English garden in the front yard. Richard provided me with fresh out of the dryer towels (the best kind of towels). Their dog is adorable but if you had allergies or anything I don't think he would bother you since the apartment is isolated. The ceilings are super high and the place gets tons of light in the morning which I loved but there's black out curtains if you don't love that kind of thing.  There's also an awesome air filter in the huge bedroom which totally helped my allergies. 

My favorite Airbnb in Austin so far. "
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara were wonderful hosts who really helped us feel welcome during our stay in Austin. The unit is comfortable and well-maintained, and the neighborhood is so charming and close to a lot of shops and restaurants and bars. "
,,,,,,,,"This lovely apartment was perfect for our weekend in Austin. You can walk to Waterloo Records and Book People. The butterfly garden was super charming, we enjoyed coffee on the porch in the mornings. 

We loved the water pressure and the wood floors. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and lovely hosts.. Thank you for making my first visit to Austin a memorable one!!
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at the William Green House Annex.  Richard and Sarah were very welcoming and the house was in terrific shape. It was also a great distance from Downtown Austin. Overall it was a perfect weekend. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a comfortable and easy stay in this spacious and charming apartment. Everything we needed was provided. The location was close to shops, restaurants and the downtown area so we were able to walk to many places. We loved staying in an old neighborhood of Austin which was very characterful. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice and close to West sixth and the Whole Foods to grab some groceries. I also stayed in Richard and Sara's carriage house which was fantastic as well"
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay here! Kindly coffee and milk supplied on our arrival. Spacious, just as listed though there is also hairdryer and iron, very handy for we Brits! Fab location, walking distance to downtown or cheap Uber. Super clean, comfy bed, endless hot water and a very pretty house with a lovely porch for morning coffee in the Austin sun. Richard always available if needed and what a lovely guy!"
,,,,,,,,"Sara and Richard were very welcoming during my visit to Austin and their place was really great!  It was cute, well kept, and what a great location.  I would definitely plan to stay there again if my travels bring me back to Austin.
"
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara were very gracious and welcoming. They had everything ready for our arrival. The location is very convenient to the 6th Street and downtown areas, yet on a quiet street. The apartment was well furnished and perfect for us. "
,,,,,,,,"Quiet and comfortable in a beautiful  neighborhood, Sara and Richard's place was a great find and I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Austin. My favorites part of the stay was the morning doves cooing in the morning just outside the bedroom window. So relaxing. Thank you! "
,,,,,,,,Loved the place! Richard and Sara were responsive and easy to get along with. The house is well situated and the neighborhood is sweet. The lodging is totally unique and a great slice of historic Austin updated to be very user friendly. The proximity to Lamar is just perfect and downtown is reachable via a number of ways.
,,,,,,,,Richard was great and the house is gorgeous.
,,,,,,,,"Such a lovely place. Great location, wholefoods and cafes are within walking distance and pretty much everything else is a quick uber away.
Hosts were great and respectful everything was easy to access and the apartment nice and spacious, the kitchen well equipped. We really enjoyed our stay."
,,,,,,,,"This was our first AirBnB stay and we couldn't have asked for a better one. The apartment was in a charming Victorian, furnished as advertised, comfortable, and full of a peaceful ambiance. There were thoughtful touches throughout, such as providing fresh milk as well as coffee; and amenities we did not expect, like sunscreen, yoga mats, shopping bags from Whole Foods (just a short walk away) and a large umbrella.

The residence is in a peaceful neighborhood, but not far away from restaurants and shopping. Downtown Austin is nearby, UT and its museums are only a bit farther off, and it is right across the river from Zilcher Park and the famous Barton Springs swimming pool. Although there were reserved parking spaces behind the house, we never had trouble finding a space on the street right in front.

We had one occasion to ask Richard, the host, for advice on nearby services, as well as ask him a question about the TV. He was super helpful and his advice was spot on.  We enjoyed talking to him and learning about his family connections to Maryland where we're from. 

My husband, the news and movie junkie, appreciated the number of cable channels offered, including premium channels such as HBO. The WiFi service was great and we had no trouble signing on.

Although we didn't do any cooking aside from making coffee and chilling drinks, the kitchenette was fully stocked with equipment and had a (small) 4-burner gas stove and oven, as well as a toaster, blender, microwave and service for 4, so had we felt like cooking or entertaining, we certainly could have.

The bedroom was very comfortable and separated from the living room by two thick doors, which I appreciated (see previously-mentioned husband who is TV junkie).

All in all, considering location, amenities, furnishings and price, this was a wonderful find. We only hope it will be free during our next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"A great, quiet apartment. Very big and nice and quiet. It was waking distance to the office I needed to get to and Whole Foods for grocery shopping. A short distance to run to get to the hike-and-bike path make it perfect. Richard was a great host, making everything super easy."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great!  Beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood close to downtown.  Easy to park.  Minutes from shopping, restaurants, bars and Whole Foods.  We would love to stay here again next time in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This is a lovely part of Austin, close to many quaint places and great walkability. The hosts had great communication to ensure I knew what I needed and  had what I needed. This historic home is a beautiful treasure and it felt good staying there."
,,,,,,,,"I highly recommend this place. Richard and Sara's house is lovely, just like in the pictures, and the neighborhood is fantastic. A short walk (less then than minutes) to two grocery stores (including a huge whole foods), several cafes, restaurants, and bars. Slightly longer walk to downtown (say twenty minutes) to downtown or to the UT Austin campus. Richard was extremely welcoming and communication with the hosts was pretty much instantaneous. I've stayed at several airbnb locations in Austin and this was my favorite."
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara's apartment is in a great location (just off downtown Austin, very convenient). It is well appointed and spacious. We loved the large king bed and closet in the bedroom, the living room and well-stocked kitchen, and Richard's and Sara's responsiveness to emails and texts. The only downside during our stay was the bathroom, which  had a tile shower that leaked onto the floor. Richard plans to repair it, but it was not something that could be done while we were there. We stayed over Christmas, so our hosts were out of town, but they made sure to promptly answer our questions about keys, thermostat, Internet, etc. We could have had our granddaughters for a sleepover (Richard and Sara said they were most welcome to sleep on the sofabed), but we ended up not doing it because we had colds. The weather got suddenly cold, and Richard provided two new extra blankets, which came in handy. "
,,,,,,,,"The William Green Hill House is a charming and delightful place and perfectly situated near walkable shopping and dining areas. Our two small kids loved playing in the magical backyard garden and visiting with the cat. There is also a wonderful playground park & pool nearby and beautiful homes in the neighborhood to stroll past. The place was very private, comfortable, safe and convenient, and we will very likely visit again! Thank you Richard and Sara for being wonderful gracious hosts and making our stay in Austin so memorable!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was perfect - exactly as pictured if not bigger, easy walking distance to great places, and very nice.  Would absolutely recommend and stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Lovely, spacious apartment with historic details and really high ceilings. We love the quiet neighborhood with proximity to both downtown and Mo-Pac. We didn't get to meet Sara and Richard this time, but they made sure everything was in order before we arrived, and they were available by cell phone if we needed anything. We didn't! Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Richard and Sara were very welcoming and accommodating. They made themselves available for anything I needed.

The space was exactly as advertised. Spacious. Lots of wood. High ceilings. Gets good light. But, if you're a late sleeper the bedroom has good blackout drapes. There's also a nice front porch to sit on if you want to read, chat or drink your tea or sip your wine. It is also very conveniently located near nearby shops and restaurants as well as very walkable to other areas. Or you could take a cab/Uber to areas further away.

Would definitely stay again if I went back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Richard and Sara were both very helpful and easy to get in touch with even though they weren't in town the weekend we stayed with them. The place was perfect - clean and well-stocked - and in a great location. 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was beautiful, clean, and as-described. The neighborhood was super gorgeous, too.  

There were a few minor hiccups, but nothing that would prevent me from staying again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"My daughter and I stayed at the William Green Hill House for an entire month while she attended classes at UT. Our time in Austin would not have been remotely as enjoyable if we had stayed anywhere else. I cannot express how grateful I am to Sara, Richard, and their son (who was home from college for the summer) for their incredible hospitality. They are genuinely concerned that their tenants are comfortable and happy, which we were. The apartment was immaculate, spacious, well-appointed, and included all the amenities one could want, including a full range of cable TV channels & wifi. The bed, sheets & blankets were so comfortable! I did quite a bit of cooking and can tell you the kitchen was great for long-term stays. We felt so at home and safe in this house and in this beautiful neighborhood.

If you appreciate well-preserved historical homes with original floors, windows, woodwork, etc. in neighborhoods filled with the like, the William Green Hill House is for you! I spent mornings eating breakfast on the front porch followed by enjoyable neighborhood walks. I spent most mornings walking down to Lake Ladybird and along the riverbank. Besides many restaurants, Einstein's bagels, Whole Foods, Amy's Ice Cream being within walking distance, there's also a graffiti park that is a must-see for those who appreciate great art. Also, a 5-minute drive away is the Texas Rowing dock where one can rent paddleboards, canoes or kayaks. All major shopping like an Apple Store, Target, department stores, etc are 10-20 minutes away.

Anytime we return to Austin, there is no question I will be contacting Sara & Richard. We are so grateful for the opportunity to stay in the apartment of this beautiful home!"
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our 4th of July weekend here. Great house in a perfect location for us. We walked to Sixth street and enjoyed Barton Springs and kayaking on Town Lake nearby. The house was clean comfortable and had everything we needed. Would stay here again for sure! 
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"I and my boyfriend's family had the pleasure of staying in Sara's historic apartment and it was absolutely perfect. Sara made sure we had everything we needed while giving us privacy to enjoy our vacation. The location was quiet, but close enough to downtown to walk. The apartment was clean and had all the necessary amenities. I'd stay here again in a heart beat. "
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend, friend and I stayed at the Annex for three nights in May. It's a lovely space -- exposed brick, original hardwood floors, a newly upgraded small kitchen, a huge bedroom and a nice bathroom with standing shower (love that we didn't have to deal with a tub!). The host, Sara, was great -- she never intruded, but would definitely have been available had we needed or wanted her. She even checked in to make sure everything was OK after unprecedented thunderstorms rolled through the city. She clearly cares about both the space and her guests.

The kitchen was great -- we walked 8 minutes to the Whole Foods and got groceries so we could cook and eat at home a few times during our visit. My friend stayed on the pull-out couch and found it very comfortable.

The total space of the unit was great for three people. The only tough bit was the location of the bathroom -- it's through the bedroom, so that's something to keep in mind if your party is more than just one or two people sleeping in the bedroom."
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience.  Sarah and Richard were very welcoming.  This was our first time using Airbnb and we plan to do it again thanks to Sarah and Richard.  
The description of the place was on point.  The place was very homey, clean and very spacious.  We loved the neighborhood.  The average person might not think this is ""close"" to downtown, but for us who are active, this was perfect.  For those who want to cook their meals, there is an awesome Whole Foods just a few blocks away as well as cafes and restaurants. 
What we did not expect was to stay at a historical place that has been own by the family for centuries and been well kept."
,,,,,,,,Sara and Richard were excellent hosts and were both very helpful when I contacted them both. The house was in the perfect area for us to take advantage of what Austin has to offer. Accommodations were beyond expectations and perfect fir a small family. Quiet neighborhood and it is a great family friendly area as well. I look forward to returning to Austin and will be planning to stay at this location again. A real gem of an Air bob.
,,,,,,,,"It was a very pleasant stay at Richard and Sara's place. The annex is its own full 1 bedroom apartment with a kitchen, bathroom. living room and large bedroom. The house is lovely and in a nice location, walking distance to Whole Foods and a couple of restaurants and bars --- and a cheap Uber ride downtown. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first airbnb experience so we didn't know what to expect. We had very little interaction with our host, which is okay by me.   Needless to say they made the home feel welcoming, like a place of our own. The house is very charming and the neighborhood was quaint. The location is great, walking distance to some cool places. We felt safe to walk the dog around the neighborhood and having the dog park near by is a plus. Overall we enjoyed our time in Richards and Sara's home. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect for what we needed during our short stay in Austin. The entire place was very tidy and comfortable. We only stayed for two days and ate our meals out, so we did not need a big kitchen.  But I appreciated that the dishes and silverware were available and were clean (and in fact looked brand new).  The bed and the couch were both very comfortable. There were printed instructions on our arrival that contained information on things like the wi fi password but also listed nearby grocery stores, restaurants and outdoor activities.  We found that list very helpful.  Everything we could have needed was available and easy to find - even shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  The hosts sent us easy instructions before we arrived, welcomed us when we arrived and were available should we need anything, even checking in with us about our comfort when the weather turned unusually cold.  The yard was beautiful, parking was easy and the house is well-situated within walking distance of shops and sights.  I have no complaints and would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay. Sara and Richard are lovely and often asked if we needed anything. The apartment is beautiful, comfortable, spacious and perfect for our 5 night stay.  The location was perfect for us, But it would also be perfect for anyone wanting to be near most of Austin. We certainly can highly recommend this sit."
,,,,,,,,"Sara and Richard are wonderful hosts and made us feel right at home.  The space was freshly redone yet is oozing with charm and character.  
It's also in a prime location,. close to everything.   We look forward to coming back again soon!!!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in an ideal location. It's so close to everything! We couldn't have been more pleased with comfortable accommodations. Would love to stay here again! 
"
,,,,,,,,"We loved the William Green House and our hosts were incredibly nice and genuine.  They responded quickly with anything we needed and went out their way to provide us with extra info about getting around, transportation, and what has changed since our last visit to Austin.  The location is beautiful and sits on a very nice, quiet street just west of downtown within walking distance to everything you'd want to experience in Austin.  Both the King size bed and the pullout sofa were very comfortable, and they had the nicest, most plush pillows I've ever slept on, seriously.  I will definitely be coming back.  Thanks again Sara and Richard!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a wonderful place to stay if youâ€™re visiting Austin, especially during a festival. It's a in a beautiful, quiet, safe, neighborhood and just a quick bike ride to downtown or Zilker Park. I fell in love with the apartment right away â€“ itâ€™s incredibly charming and comfortable, and Sara and Richard are fantastic, responsive, thoughtful hosts. Everything you want from an airbnb experience. Wish I could have stayed longer!"
,,,,,,,,"Sara's place is wonderful and cozy, and they are very attentive.  There is one master bed and a pull out that worked great for us.  The neighborhood is great as well.  It's a nice walk to the convention center and near whole foods. I would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"The William Green House is the *perfect* place to stay in Austin. The historic property and all its charm compel you to stay put while the walkable location, nearby amenities and authentic spots draw you out. When I return, it will be to stay right here. "
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful home and a truly wonderful experience. Traveling with a toddler, the last thing I needed was to have a stuffy hotel room with no place to let him decompress. Not only was there tons of space, but Richard and Sara had a pack n play and a high chair for us! The home is a true vintage gem, and Richard is one heck of a remodeler. The neighborhood is super quiet and so close to everything. We couldn't have asked for better hosts either. If you're looking for top notch comfort at the most reasonable price, book it now!"
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay!  Sara and Richard were very welcoming and had everything perfectly ready for our visit.  The neighborhood was great - quiet with easy walkability - and we took advantage of the nearby restaurants and shops.  The house is very spacious and has a comfortable bed, sofa, and modern bathroom.  For future Austin trips, we would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Sara & Richard were terrifically accommodating and the place is just lovely, perfectly appointed and located. We wanted to return for the subsequent weekend, but It was unfortunately booked. If I return to Austin I would certainly stay here again for as long as I could. Highly recommended,"
6539818,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great place to stay in Austin. It's comfortable, clean, and perfect location with easy access to downtown or UT.   "
,,,,,,,,The place is really nice; well maintained and in a part of town where there is plenty to do within walking distance.
,,,,,,,,"Julia was a great host!  She was very responsive to all of our questions during our stay and very accommodating for our check in and check out times.  The apartment was great, clean, and had everything we needed!  The location was very close to downtown, about a 7 minute cab or bike ride and a slight walk.  I would definitely recommend Julia's place and if we travel back to Austin I will be looking forward to staying there again!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great, small place. 3 of us shared it for 3 days and the location was ideal for walking to both the UT campus and downtown. We did not need to rent a car but Zipcars were close by if the need arose. It is very clean, the beds are comfy and it was quiet as well. It's a great value and I'd stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Julia was a wonderful host during my week-long trip to Austin! She was extremely easy to contact and very prompt in answering any questions I had. She also provided me with useful details about ride share start-ups in Austin, which was a very helpful touch since Uber/Lyft are no longer operating in the area.

The studio was beautiful -- modern yet cozy, and the perfect size for two people. The bed was super comfy and the walk-in closet was a big plus. 

The neighborhood is quiet, but there are easily walkable spots to eat and drink nearby. Downtown/6th Street are just a short drive or cab ride away. Since we rented a car for our trip, the parking space was one of the best amenities provided. Keep in mind that the space is pretty tight, so a compact car or smaller is best. There is also a complimentary laundry room right next door to the unit, which we didn't use, but is really handy if you need to wash any items during your stay. 

All in all, 5/5 stars for Julia's studio! It was exactly as shown in the listing and felt like home while we were there. :) I would definitely stay here again during any future trips to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"This place was well located, safe, very clean and Julia was a great, well communicating host. She had everything we needed, and her apartment is very cute and cozy. Would come back. "
,,,,,,,,This was a very nice stay. The unit was perfect for my wife and I. We were comfortable and felt at home. The location was close to everything and was usually within 5-15 minutes by car. All in all we had a blast. Thanks Julia!
,,,,,,,,Staying at Julia's was easy-peasy.  She sent me all the information the day before and coordinated check-in and check-out times.  The place itself was clean and conveniently located!
,,,,,,,,Julia's place was perfect for my stay during ACL weekend. The location is close to downtown in a very quiet neighborhood.  The apartment had everything we needed. It was easy to communicate with Julia.  I would definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"Great spot, great location.  Super clean unit and perfect size for a couple.   Bus stop and coffee shop close by.  Would definitely recommend."
,,,,,,,,Great communication about the apartment. 
,,,,,,,,"This location was exactly what it says it would be and was exactly what I needed. Julia was very good about sharing all the needed details and my check in was perfect. I needed to stay near the UT campus but also close to the convention center so the location was great. I was worried about how walkable the area would really turn out to be, but it was very, very walkable. All the amenities were available and the space had all the conveniences. It was exactly what I needed. "
,,,,,,,,Super cute place with a great layout! We had 4 people staying here and it didn't feel cramped at all. The location is a little off the beaten path but a short cab ride to everything. 
,,,,,,,,My friends and I stayed at Julia's place for a few nights. The place is very nice and clean. The location is great and we appreciated the extra air mattress that was provided. Would enjoy staying there again.
,,,,,,,,Great location! He apartment was so clean and we felt at home. Definitely staying here again!
,,,,,,,,"Very cozy, clean and well-equipped.  Building is very quiet and location is convenient.  Would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Julia was great from beginning to end! Great communication plus the area and apartment couldn't have been better!  I'm hoping we have an excuse to stay in Austin again because this will be our first choice!
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Julia's place for a week and it was perfect! Julia was very responsive, her place was exactly as listed, and everything was very smooth. I recommend staying here when in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,The unit was nice and exactly as described. It's on a quiet street not far from UT Austin. Entry was easy and everything I needed was in the unit. It's not far from the beautiful Shoal Creek Trail for runs.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Julia's place was amazing. The apartment was clean, beautiful and cozy. We were on a cross country road trip and she was kind enough to be flexible with our check in and check out times when we arrived earlier than expected, and then wanted to stay a little later. Thank you Julia! "
,,,,,,,,"Julia was an accommodating host, working around my travel schedule as best she could. Check-in and check-out could not have been easier. The studio itself is a quaint gem that is located on a quiet street in the heart of the city. I had privacy, convenience, and everything I could have asked for. I appreciated Julia's recommendations for getting around town and look forward to staying at her place again the next time I have business at UT Austin. "
,,,,,,,,This place was great! I stayed there when going to a conference at the AT&T center. It was walking distance to the conference and the apartment itself is very cute and neat. Julia also accommodated me dropping off my suitcase before the check in time since my flight arrived that morning. I definitely recommend this place!
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great! Clean, spacious and functional. Thank you Julia for being a great host!"
,,,,,,,,Julia's place was absolutely perfect! Convenient location coupled with a covered parking spot. The place was tidy and well kept. Julia was very easy to reach with any questions we had and also provided us great recommendations for places to eat and visit. 
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Julia's was great even before we got there. She gave us valuable information before our trip (it was our first time in Austin), told us about a ride sharing app after Uber left, etc. When we did arrive, the place was immaculate and had everything you'd ever need. There were dishes, utensils (even a wine opener, which we had forgotten), a dispenser of shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the shower and other nice touches. We would definitely recommend staying at Julia's if you ever find yourself in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Julia was very responsive and welcoming to my request to inspect the apartment beforehand. The apartment is very conveniently located close to UT, so it served my family's purpose of attending my graduation very well. It snugly fits 4 people (we had 3 adults and 1 child, the bed fits 2 adults and the child and the other person slept on the sofa which can be pulled out into a bed). Good place to stay if you're in school and looking to have family come over to visit you."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience with AirBnb and I was very pleased with the experience!  The room is in a very quiet community within minutes of EVERYTHING! Julia checked in frequently and was very responsive to messages.  I am definitely looking forward to staying again!  If I had to complain about one thing it would be the parking.  If you have a larger vehicle, space 18 is a LITTLE tight, i had to bring my mirrors in to fit. Other than that, perfection. "
,,,,,,,,"Julia was a fantastic host. Her apartment is absolutely adorable and everything you need for a great stay in austin. A short walk downtown or to the university, the location is great and really feels like vacation. Julia gve great recommendations and was super responsive - she recommended the BEST pancakes at Kirbey Lane. Thank you!!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience at Julia's downtown apartment was a delight.  Julia was an excellent host and any and all of our questions were answered very quickly. 
The apartment was exactly as described and
it was well stocked and very clean. 
We especially appreciated the location as it was very easy to get around and the neighborhood was quite walkable!
It was nice to have a kitchen and it too, was well stocked and very clean.
Julia was exceptionally helpful ,even allowing us to stay a few extra hours to 
accommodate our flight schedule!!  We were very grateful!!! 
This apartment helped make our Austin
stay very special!

,,,,,,,,"This apartment provided everything I needed for a nine-day stay near the University of Texas. Julia made sure the apartment was well-equipped, including lots of supplies for the kitchen. The apartment was clean, quiet, convenient and attractive."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent experience. Wonderful apartment. Perfectly described. Added benefit that the cable service (ATT U-verse) includes DVR capability!

Thank you Julia.

Tom"
,,,,,,,,"We had a fabulous stay in Julia's lovely apartment.  Everything was just as described, very clean and great to have a fully equipped kitchen and comfortable bed. The location is fantastic both for UT and to get downtown or to South Congress with the rapid buses. A great choice for a stay in Austin. Julia is a generous and very helpful host, and went beyond the call of duty!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great apartment in a lovely neighborhood! It was very easy to find the place and we were greeted with a gift basket!

Property and apartment were both very clean and quiet. The shower was AMAZING and the apartment was well stocked with linens/towels as well as little extras in the kitchen, probably left by previous renters."
,,,,,,,,"This place was fantastic! It looks exactly like the pictures and is in a great area in Austin, situated between downtown and the UT campus. Julia was a wonderful host in making sure everything ran smoothly. There were some technical difficulties when I tried to book the listing and Julia held my reservation while she contacted Airbnb and got everything sorted before I could even bat an eye! If I needed a place to stay in Austin again I would definitely look to come back here. "
,,,,,,,,Great experience. Left little treats and a map of the area.
,,,,,,,,Julia was fantastic. She was incredibly accommodating. I would recommend her and her apartment to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,Julia's studio was a cozy and well-furnished place to stay for a few nights while exploring Austin. We walked downtown each day and took Lyfts at night. The area is quiet and residential but a very quick drive to the main tourist attractions. The bed and pull out couch we're both very comfortable and all the amenities we needed we're included for us. Overall a great experience!
,,,,,,,,"The listing was exactly as described. It is in a quiet neighborhood but quite close to UT Austin and walking distance to downtown bars and restaurants. Everything was clean and tidy, the bed was comfortable and the wifi worked well. We didn't really use the kitchen but it seemed well-equipped. "
,,,,,,,,"Julia's listing was awesome! A great first impression to Austin! My best friend and I stayed in Julia's Airbnb for a girls weekend, and it couldn't have been better. The place is so well equipped. Everything we could ask for was there. Julia was also very helpful with any questions we have. Nothing but good things to say about the really cute location!"
,,,,,,,,Stayed here for a girls trip. It was a short trip (2 nights). Julia was extremely accommodating with everything we needed. Check in/check out time. Anytime I visit Austin I would stay here. Beautiful and comfortable home. 
,,,,,,,,Julia was beyond helpful during our stay.  The place was very easy to find and get into.  Great location and very easy to get to/from from all fun areas of Austin.  Would totally recommend staying here for anyone visiting Austin.  5 stars all the way!!  Thank you Julia!!
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay. This is a great location if you need to be close to UT or the capitol.
,,,,,,,,Julia and her place were awesome. Perfect accommodations for a traveling professionals with lots of access and help for the basics. This is one of my favorite places to stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful, comfortable and spotlessly clean apartment in a super-convenient location on a quiet street near downtown and UT campus. Bed was super-comfortable, towels were fluffy, and Julia was extremely gracious, communicating fully every step of the way.  Thanks for the hospitality, and I'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Just as listed! Nice place. Close to several attractions in Austin. Julia is a great host and had everything ready. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Julia was very responsive; the apartment was clean, quiet, adorable, and very near campus and plenty of fun things to do! Delightful!"
,,,,,,,,"All was as expected and lovely. Thanks, Julia!"
,,,,,,,,"My colleague, Ann-Sofie, stayed in this apartment. Her review: The apartment was lovely, in a very nice and quiet part of town, and exactly as presented in the description on Airbnb. We found it easily, following the descriptions from the hostess. It had everything we needed for our stay (except a printer, but that can't be expected in an Airbnb), and the laundry room was right around the corner. The stairs to the apartment were pretty steep to climb, especially with heavy luggage, and we would have liked a manual for the tv, with a list of the channels, which were hard to find since they were spread out. The bed was VERY comfortable, and was ok for two persons - but would probably not be easy for all guests to get into, since there was basically no room on either side of the bed. "
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! This adorable little apartment had everything my friends and I needed. Comfort, full kitchen amenities, close to downtown, coffee, etc. Felt like a safe neighborhood, too! Perfect location. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. 

Julia was very responsive to the few questions I had and very accommodating to a request I made. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean, cute place within walking distance of downtown and UT.  Julia was responsive and even went out of her way to deliver us some items.  "
,,,,,,,,Julia was a fabulous host. Her place was perfect for the two nights. It was extremely comfortable and clean. The location was great and within walking distance of everything.
,,,,,,,,Julia's apartment was great and very clean. The apartment was walking distance to Univ of Texas and also a short walk to the State Capitol. We took Uber a couple times and it was very reasonable. I would recommend staying here!  
,,,,,,,,"Great experience, and Julia was very helpful! "
,,,,,,,,Julia was a great host. The apartment is very comfortable and cute. She provided information on how to get around and places to go near the apartment.  The neighborhood is walking distance to UT and all of the shops that surround the campus.  Thanks Julia!
,,,,,,,,"The studio was all that was promised.  Air conditioning worked well, getting in and out was easy, and Julia was responsive to all questions.  The studio is right near campus, near food and supplies, and within relatively easy walking distance of downtown.  The foldout couch was also quite comfortable (as those things go).  Would recommend to anyone staying in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Julia contacted us just before we arrived and was in touch anytime we needed. The place was just as described and worked perfectly for us. We were within walking distance to UT and short cab ride from downtown
,,,,,,,,"The condo was as described - we settled in with ease, each with our own cozy bed to sleep in, coffee maker to rise us in the morning, and a great amount of closet space for our various weekend outfits. We had fluffy towels, many pillows and blankets, and the AC was always on.  Julia was kind enough to let us check in early and check out late, since there was no one staying on either end.  We lucked out, since the extra time was invaluable.  My only complaint is, once check-out was complete, Julia became unresponsive to my messages regarding the security deposit.  It feels frustrating to be ignored, and have communication stop. I would appreciate a response to my questions. That is my only criticism.  "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here last weekend with two girl friends, the apartment was delightful and a perfect size for the three of us... there is even a whole dressing area, and make-up station so no arguments over who was hogging the mirror. Julia was a great host and I would definitely recommend this place for a weekend stay :) "
,,,,,,,,Julia's lovely apartment had everything we could ask for on our short stay in Austin! The place was decorated very chic and spacious for two people and in a gray neighborhood. She was also very responsive to our questions. I would highly recommend staying at her place! 
,,,,,,,,We truly had a lovely stay at Julia's! The apartment was perfectly located and Julia was a terrific host. She welcomed us with open arms and ensured that we had anything we needed. I would recommend this to everyone travelling to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,Julia's apartment was in a perfect location for getting around Austin and had absolutely everything we needed for our stay. On our second night the aircon stopped working but Julia sorted it out quickly and easily. Would definitely recommend dealing with her! 
,,,,,,,,Instructions were easy to follow and everything was exactly where I expected them to be. The neighborhood was quiet and a short walk from a number of restaurants and shops. The actual apartment was charming and larger than I had expected. I  would definitely stay here again on future trips.
,,,,,,,,"When we entered the apartment, we were floored by the home decor and the cleanliness of the place.  Not only that it had the basicc necessities provided for us: towels, utensils, cups, plates, wine opener, shampoo, conditioner, soap and etc.  Netflix was also provided for us and internet.  I would definitely recommend this place to other people. "
,,,,,,,,"The location is great, right by the Capitol, walking distance to 6th street, and relatively in the heart of the city! You can also walk to UT Austin Campus and the LBJ library.
The place looks completely remodeled, too, so the faucets and counters are really nice."
14237227,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Jay was an excellent host! Highly recommended! 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect accommodations for a weekend visit to Austin. Not only was the location perfect, but it was a breeze to check-in/out and the building offers a ton of useful amenities. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,Jay was a wonderful communicator. The location was perfect for our family vacation.
,,,,,,,,It was great.  An amazing location and a beautiful place. The place was also super clean and exactly as expected.  I had no problem in communicating with Jay.  Would gladly stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Look, there are other places to stay in downtown Austin, but I doubt there are many better. You're right on Rainey Street with great bars, restaurants, and food trucks. A 5 minute walk to the convention center. A 10-15 minute walk just about anywhere else downtown. 

The room has a stunning view of the city. Two bedrooms, a spacious modern bathroom, full kitchen, and a washer and dryer. You can go out every night, or you can grab some groceries and stay in and watch Netflix on the flatscreen. 

And the pool? Only a rooftop infinity pool with enough space and amenities to hang out there the entire day and night. 

This is where you want to be. "
,,,,,,,,"4 out of 5 stars. 

Pros - You cant find a better view. You cant find a better location. You're in the heart of it all. This is a beautiful apartment and Jay was a fantastic host. 

Cons - Saying this place accommodates 6 is a stretch. Their was no air matress, only a love sac in the living room. The wifi didnt work and the TV could only stream (since there was no internet, it was useless). The neighbors are not nearly as polite about music as this listing asks. This place is LOUD. Rainey street goes most of the night and the neighbors right next door partied every night.  

All that said, its still a great place to stay. Nobody stays this close to the action expecting to stay in the room and watch Downton Abbey. This is a place to act as a base to experience all the great that Austin has. And it works perfectly for that. Sleep, shower, shave and out. Repeat as necessary. Such a great city an the value of being right in the middle of it is unmatched. I would stay here again in a heart beat. Just not with more than 4 people again. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was in a fantastic location. Just meters away from the interesting and exciting nightlife of Austin. Lost of food trucks, trendy bars and restaurants within a short stroll of the apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Our group had no problems with check-in. The building utilizes a very innovative parcel pickup system so you can retrieve the condo keys. We were amazed at how well kept the condo was, and as we arrived in the evening, the Rainey Street bars and restaurants were already going strong. Huge plus for location and amenities, as it is right in the heart of the Rainey Street district, which is a great spot for the 25-40 yr crowds. The rooftop pool was a terrific amenity especially after a long day adventuring in Austin.   Our condo was on the top floor, 8th floor, which was very convenient for the top floor amenities like the gym, business office, Party room and outdoor grill and cabana areas. 

The hosts were terrific, able to respond to most requests immediately. They provided a well detailed welcome note that helped get our group acclimated to the temporary home in beautiful Austin. 

When we visit Austin again, we will definitely stay here again if it's available. "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent host, excellent location, clean, and spacious. I would most definitely come back and stay this apartment again. "
,,,,,,,,"The host was great, very accommoding and had great recommendations for food and bars. The host really went above and beyond to make our trip enjoyable! For our first time in Austin it was the best location! Rainey street is by far the best area for the bars and night life in Austin. When I come back with my husband I will definitely stay on Rainey Street again."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was incredibly clean and looked exactly like the pictures. Very bright and roomy, perfect location, great crash pad for a girls' night, exactly what we wanted! Jay was a lovely host that communicated to us everything we needed to know very clearly and efficiently. Would love to stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location,  lovely host, easy to park, close to kits of financial bars and restaurants! Wonderful time"
,,,,,,,,"Jay was very hospitable and available for any issues that we might've had.  The property was very nice and had great amenities in the building.  Excellent location for nightlife, too.  Will recommend to everyone!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment is very spacious and in a great location. Rooftop pool is excellent and really quiet. Beds very comfortable as well. Definitely recommend staying here! 
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience with Jay. She's great to work with and accommodated us with everything we needed. She gave us some great recommendations as well. The apartment is amazing. It's in a great location, close to the trail on the river and all the best bars in Austin. I know where I'm staying next time I'm in Austin :). "
,,,,,,,,"Kurt was very friendly and helpful. But the apartment hadn't been thoroughly cleaned: hairs in every room, leftovers in the fridge, wet towels in the washer. The hot water in the bathroom takes many minutes to get hot, while making a creaking /popping sound behind the walls, and the water pressure in the shower is really poor. We were also very frustrated by the loud street noise that even the loud air conditioner didn't cover up. I can see an under 30 crowd loving the place, but we were there for work and were exhausted and got very little sleep when we needed it most. The bed is stiff and uncomfortable. If you're young and on a budget, this place might be just right, but if you can afford to spend a little more, your expectations will probably be better met elsewhere. The pool and the view were great and the location close to downtown and the convention center were great. "
,,,,,,,,Great condo in a great location. Worked well for our group and host was very accommodating of our travel schedule. Would recommend staying at. 
,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent condo to hang out with friends. Plenty of beds and cool amenities. We really like the distressed wood table (not shown in photos). There are more upgrades that aren't shown in photos. Definitely book you short stay here :)

As well, they made sure that someone waited up for our midnight arrival. Made it much easier and we appreciate that."
,,,,,,,,"Place was beautiful and clean.  Pictures didnt do it justice.  Perfectly located by great bars, restaurants, and food trucks.  Host was fantastic and the building's management team couldn't have been more helpful helping us navigate the city.  

Beautiful pool overlooking the city"
,,,,,,,,Great location! We were in walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go. Awesome amenities in the building and the management is very friendly. Our host was also very responsive and accommodating. Would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was absolutely beautiful, Kurt was a wonderful host. The view was unbelievable, located right in downtown Austin. He made sure we had everything we needed and more, we will definitely request this apartment for our next trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,We stayed here during an event at the convention center. Rainey Street Luxury apartment was absolutely amazing.  The Roof top pool is great and is actually bigger than the picture shows.  This place is brand new and I will definitely stay here every time I can in Austin.  It was a 5 min walk to the convention center and there are lots of options for food and bars within an easy walk.  We saved a ton of time for the event because there is a coffee machine in the lobby and we did not have to wait in line to get caffeine. Craig the host was great.  He met us with the keys and answered any questions we had.  He also invited us to an event at the pool which was awesome.
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience staying at this location on Rainey Street. Everything was clean and new. This is the best location in Austin. Will be back again.

Thanks, Craig!"
,,,,,,,,"My first experience using AirBnb was very impressive. Craig was extremely friendly and very responsive with any questions I had. If you're in Austin TX, you gotta use Craig for your next stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Location location location. This is the only place to stay. Right on Rainey st, super modern, quiet and fully catered for, Craig has a great place with an epic infinity pool. We are already booking our return trip to stay. Book this with confidence."
,,,,,,,,"Craig was able to accomidate my last minute request to stay in his place. He provided great ideas for activities and when I needed extra blankets he was over in minutes to provide them. The location of this apartment is fantastic, I could go right downstairs to a rainey street bar or was a short walk to the Lake. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed for my stay. Looking forward to staying again!"
898609,4.5,9,9,9,10,9,9,It perfectly fit our needs. Close to the convention center and resturants. 
,,,,,,,,"Five girls and I stayed at this condo for my sister's bachelorette party trip to Austin. The condo sleeps 6, but 4 would have been more comfortable as two of us had to sleep on the couch that pulls out. The only negatives are that the wifi didn't work and neither did the water dispenser on the fridge. We went through a lot of bottles of water. The location was perfect and we walked (almost) everywhere. "
,,,,,,,,"The place is stunning with a lot natural light, I really enjoyed my stay here. The apartment complex is right next to the convention center and very close to the center of Austin. The hosts were extremely responsive and througough. Would absolutely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location. Apartment was as advertised. Not a ton of natural light, but perhaps that's normal in this part of the country? Not sure. Washer / dryer was out of commission. If you are looking for a very safe, affordable and very conveniently located place to crash, then this is your spot. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location,  cozy.  "
,,,,,,,,This condo is just in the oat awesome spot! We truly loved our stay! The beds were comfy and all was amazing! The washer was a little loud but I think it maybe just needs a belt or something :-) Mark and Christy and the folks at Turnkey were very helpful and everything was just great!
,,,,,,,,"Place was great. Loved the hands off approach, super close to everything I needed in town!"
,,,,,,,,"Great and not so great...
The place really was great and a perfect location with a gated parking spot.  It felt like a very safe place and we did enjoy it.
Hosts were helpful, however we had trouble with airbnb and or turnkey(the management company I believe).  We showed up and one of the 2 didn't have us as reserved.  It took a good hour to get it straightened out.
I will blame the management company for this next part, as there were dirty sheets on one of the twin beds, though both looked slept in as they were very wrinkled  The extra sheets in the closet were fine, but the extra pillow cases were dirty(literally had  rouge or makeup on them).  
One of the twin bedspreads had what was a dried glob of something on it.  There was a beer can under that same bed.  
The dryer timer knob was broken off and  there were no pliers to turn the remaining piece, so we had to hang up our laundry.
I reported all these things in a email survey to the management company, but got no response."
,,,,,,,,"The positives.....the location is fantastic if you're looking for all that is fun in downtown Austin....plus the property management people were very nice and helpful when we discovered that the parking entry device had not been left for us.  The negatives...the condos were (let's say) affordably constructed and this unit is equally ""affordably"" furnished.  Neither seem to have worn well of late.  It could use an update and a little more light....There were also a few utility issues which I informed the hosts.also, I found it confusing after finalizing the reservation with Airbnb, I immediately began getting emails informing me that I needed to create an account with the owners's property service ""Turnkey"".....seems the rental process is automated to the hilt.  Not sure I ever had a direct response to my emails from the hosts.t"
,,,,,,,,"Great Location.  The property was located 2 blocks away from 6th St. and a short 5 min walk from Congress.   Nice kitchen, unit was very clean and building was secure.  The hallways of building echo, so noise travels,however unit is next to a water fountain that creates a nice white noise.   "
,,,,,,,,"The entire process was smooth and appreciated. The location was incredible (central to bras, restaurants), and the apartment was great. Keyless entry was brilliant, and a rep answered a call late at night within minutes upon arrival to correct an issue. Would return and stay here again. Thank you for making my first trip to Austin a memorable one. "
,,,,,,,,"The condo was very conveniently located in Downtown, and looks exactly as pictured.  It is clean and the building is quiet.  The second bedroom faces out on the street, and there may be a little street noise, but not much.  Most importantly, the neighborhood is very safe. Communication with the hosts was easy. I would recommend this condo highly for anyone looking for two bedrooms and not wanting to stay in a hotel."
,,,,,,,,"Overall, my experience was fine. The photos were accurate + the location very convenient to downtown + all that's happening on Sixth Street. There were a couple of small things to note which were a bit annoying/frustrating. If it'd just been one thing it'd have been fine, but there were just a few small things that added up like the television being difficult to change, the dryer knob being missing, and street noise. The most annoying thing was that although there is a quiet policy at night, the fellow residents of the building did not observe, making for a tough night's sleep. Overall, not bad. "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent condo in a great location right in the heart of downtown Austin. Nicely furnished.  Very clean.  Very comfortable.  Will definitely be looking at this particular unit again for my next visit.

Key code access to the building and the flat made check in and check out very easy. Excellent service on this front. Kept in touch with us via email the entire time to make sure we had everything we needed.  

Can't say enough good things about the condo and the service. Thanks."
,,,,,,,,Location can't be beat! Great communication throughout the process. Condo is on the older side but very well kept. Would recommend for anyone coming in wanting a great location and secure parking
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic Condo in the perfect location!  We loved staying here, and will look into for future travel.  This was our first experience staying at an Airbnb property, and it was a great one! "
,,,,,,,,Basic apartment next with very convenient access to Austin Convention Center. Nice to have full kitchen access. 
,,,,,,,,Great location!  Walking distance to the Moody Theater as well as most of the downtown entertainment districts.  The condo was very clean and well kept.   Thanks for a great stay!
,,,,,,,,Love the location and the condition of the property. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place in the heart of Austin, close to the best things the city has to offer. The apartment was clean, and looked just like the picture. To use the pool you have to cross the street but that wasn't a big deal at all. It was perfect to have parking in the building too."
,,,,,,,,"I was great to stay in this beautiful place, during our conference visit in Austin. Everything was comfortable and easy.
I liked the fact, that all I needed was in a footwalking distance.
Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Mark and Christy's condo was perfect for our business stay in Austin. Great location within walking distance of everything you want. I never had to hunt for emails or reach out at any time. Mark and Christy had everything set up for us; directions were clear and communication proactive. The place was spotless on arrival. The rooms comfortable. Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,"Since we were in town attending a wedding, the location couldn't have been better! The rehearsal dinner, the church ceremony, and the reception were all downtown. We could walk to everything! Fantastic! It was great to have our own little place in the heart of lively Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment, even better location! 1 min. Walk to 6th street, and food places all around the place! "
,,,,,,,,Your welcoming email was nice. Location was very convenient. 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was beautiful and very comfortable. We were there on business, so it was great to come home after a long day and relax. So much more ""homey"" feeling than a hotel! I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town."
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was perfect.  The condo is located in a wonderful part of town, close to everything you would want to explore in Austin.   Nearly everything is within walking distance from the townhouse.  The place is well maintained and clean.  We could hear noise from the street one night in the second bedroom (nothing a pair of earplugs couldn't fix), but the master bedroom is in back, away from the street, so it was nice and quiet.  We loved the courtyard in the center of the complex, and in the early mornings could hear the birds singing, which is rare in the middle of a city.  We also loved the fact that we could come and go using a keypad and we weren't relying on keys that could easily be lost.  We loved our time in Austin.  Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is lovely, very clean, very well decorated and appointed, very secure and in a great location. The hosts were very communicative and accommodating, though I didn't meet them. Highly recommend and will definitely stay here in Austin again."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was incredibly convenient to the convention center and plenty comfortable for 4 women to share. Everything was clean and neat, and above all, convenient! Very happy with our choice."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exceptionally well-located being within walking distance of main downtown locations and restaurants.  It is also quite a pleasant stroll to Wholesfoods Market which is only some 12-15 mins walk away.   It was very comfortable - well-presented, clean and well-equipped.  Access was straightforward and the inclusion of a parking space made a big difference.  The notification of earlier possible check-in and check-out times was much appreciated.  All in all - highly recommended.  "
,,,,,,,,Amazing place.  Perfect location.  Great amount of space.  Very stylish.  Great communication on the front end and during the visit. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Highly recommended.
,,,,,,,,The home was very warm and welcoming
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 98 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"The location for this AirBnB was SO central and could not have been more convenient. Very good communication throughout the process with their property management company and very easy to access the AirBnB. 

There were a couple things that are left a little to be desired about this place:

-The AirBnB listing advertises a sofa bed, but the sofa bed was not working (the bed was broken and wheels were off the runners that would allow it to pull out)
-The hot water had issues, and the showers were only hot for about 2-3 minutes before they got cold
-There was a dead fly on the bathroom counter and someone else's leftover food in the fridge. Not the best to walk into.

Other than that, the place suited our needs great and we're glad there was a lot of space to spread out in. "
,,,,,,,,"Mark, Christy and TurnKey were very responsive, both via email and on two occasions when I valled them. The property location CANNOT BE BEAT!  This condo is in the very center of downtown Austin and everything you want will be within a few min. walk.  The condo was clean, well furnished and felt very safe."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and really a beautiful home. The place was thoughtfully furnished and decorated and the complex is kept very clean. Yes, it can be noisy, but our lightest sleeper wore earplugs and had no trouble sleeping through the night.

Excellent place for a family for space, location, and convenience."
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect and just as advertised.   Check in was simple and the condo was very comfortable and fit our needs.   Security of the building was also good. The condo was in the best location we could have wanted with an added bonus of some great restaurants within easy walking distance.   
,,,,,,,,Great place
,,,,,,,,"Mark and Christy were great all around.  They were prompt with replying to our request to book, and once we arrived, everything was as described.  Our apartment in Austin was in a great location, and had plenty of space for a family of four.  I would recommend both the apartment, and the hosts to anyone traveling to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Great place very well located near the Austin Convention Centre and the 6th street. The flat was very spacious and comfortable.We really enjoyed the place.
,,,,,,,,Great place in a great part of town.  Spacious and very comfortable.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat! 
,,,,,,,,"Mark and Christy's place was great.  Location is fantastic, close to good restaurants, 6th St and Rainey St and the apartment was spacious and clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here."
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here with my husband and our two kids.  We loved the condo. Great location. Great management...they were very attentive and willing to work with me on check out time!  Cute modern decor, as well secure gates and parking. The neighbors were friendly.  The pool is in the next building across the street - very easy and convenient, as well as private!  We had the pool to ourselves most days.  Sure, it gets loud at times, but you are downtown!  That's why you stay downtown, to be within walking distance to everything.  That's just part of ""living"" in the city.  I would definitely come back.  Austin is a great city, and this location can't be beat!"
,,,,,,,,"Pros: Christy was fantastic. The people at Turnkey were equally fantastic. The location is the best thing ever if you're doing a convention between being right by that and sixth street. There's a pool that was pretty dead the whole time we were there. Plenty of room.   Please keep in mind that for the cons, NONE of them outweigh how awesome this place is. That being said: 

Cons: When we arrived, there were dirty pans (as in goo caked to the bottom + hair) in them. I was informed that the dishwasher was having issues and they needed to call a maintenance guy out for it.  We discovered that the outlets in the bathrooms were faulty which led to 3 girls having to do their hair in the kitchen with the big mirrors. Not the end of the world but inconvenient to say the least.  At night, if you are a light sleeper, people are drunk and loud outside the windows. Also if you're tall (I'm 5'9, so any taller than me) the shower tends to be awkward as it's very low with intermittent water pressure which leads to slower showers. There were minor bumps in the road, but they were available to correct the problem as soon as they could, and fixed it.

The washer/dryer are hard to access as they're behind a glass sliding pane (all of the glass sliding panes are jerky and I was afraid I was going to break them, truthfully) and the dryer only worked intermittently. (3 gos to dry out some towels, for example.) 

That being said, next year we fully intend to return because the people were great, the location is fantastic, and overall when I stay somewhere I mostly want somewhere to crash, not somewhere to live so the problems ended up being rather minimal compared to how much time was spent. "
,,,,,,,,"Location is ideal!  Condo is reasonably well appointed, though a bit thin on cooking items if you are going to want to do that.

The layout of the condo complex does, however, seem to amplify the noise from revelers returning from 6th St.  Shouting in the halls at 2:30am happened just about every night.

Overall, I would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,Great location.   The apartment is ok but not new as the pictures appear.  Owner needs to do some updating on the amenities but overall it was ok. 
,,,,,,,,"Two elderly female members of our family stayed here during a recent visit to Austin for our daughter's wedding.  The condo was in a great location in downtown Austin.  It is up a flight of stairs.  It could have been a little bit cleaner and there were some maintenance issues with closet doors, etc.  It was being transferred to a different managing agency so some confusion with door codes, etc.  Not really Airbnb's fault.  Some street noise, but overall okay.  "
,,,,,,,,Loved this place! Great location! Really easy accessible! Thanks Mark + Christy!
,,,,,,,,Mark and Christy was quick to response and took care of booking. Their condo was comfortable with a great location for foodies and bar hoppers. Downtown Austin was very walkable and beautiful. It was nice to leave the car in the garage. My only issue was locating the condo because I didn't understand the sequence of the numbers. Here's my tip when you enter from the main gate make a right towards the stairs. The condo is located on the second floor on the left. Mark and Christy's condo is a nice place to stay while you're in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was amazing! The unit is great and we felt like we were back home. It is newly renovated and had everything we need for our stay. The location is great, with lots of restaurants and bars a stone throw away. Mark and Christy were really easy to work with and made the experience really easy. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.."
,,,,,,,,"It is a charming condo with all the amenities included, It is walking distance from the 6th street and has a lot of eating options close by. We could not have stayed at a better location. "
,,,,,,,,"AWESOME location!!!  This place is ideally close to all bars, restaurants, and Towne Lake.  Looks bigger than the pictures give credit for and it was super clean."
,,,,,,,,"The place was perfect for our stay and conference at the convention center right across the street!  I received two different sets of information though on the codes for entry, which caused us some issues, but eventually we got in!  Recommended for your stay in Austin! Super convenient!"
,,,,,,,,"Instructions were easy to understand, place was very clean, cozy, and in a great location. Would definitely stay here again when visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Very nice condo located in a very convenient location for both the convention centre and all the bars and restaurants.

"
,,,,,,,,What a great condo right in the middle of everything Austin has to offer!  This was our first Air B&B experience and we couldn't be happier!  The condo was very clean and nicely decorated. The kitchen was well appointed with anything you needed to make dinner there although we never did because there were so many great restaurants. Thanks Mark and Christy for sharing your condo and your wonderful city! We will be back.
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful host ,always happy to help and the location was perfect,Apartment was clean with ample space for two couples,and despite central location was extremely quiet.
Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"The condo was adorable and so close to all of Austin's main attractions...shopping, food, nightlife, convention center, Palmer Center, farmer's market & (URL HIDDEN) car rental necessary!
Christy, the host/owner, is responsive, answering texts & emails promptly and providing assistance when asked.

"
,,,,,,,,This apt is in the perfect location. Literally in the middle of it all for SXSW. The apartment is super cute and Mark + Christy did a fantastic job decorating it. It was also immaculate and very comfortable. Definitely recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Mark and Christy's condo was wonderful!  3 coworkers and I were in town for SXSW EDU for 4 days and were hoping for a comfortable, quiet, and most importantly convenient accommodation since we knew hotel rates would be inflated for the conference.  

The rate for the condo was such a budget for 4 people: compared to getting 2 hotel rooms for the conference, we were saving about $600 total. Insane!

The unit was extremely clean and aptly equipped! Christy gave us detailed and accurate instructions for getting into the unit which was successful - and we couldn't have asked for a better location to the Austin Convention Center - literally, across the street. It had the basics in terms of kitchenware-just enough for very simple food prep, but perhaps not for a full in-home meal from scratch.  But no matter, you should be out exploring Austin's eats anyway!

All in all, an amazing experience.  It made our conference week that much better and comfortable.

Thank you Mark and Christy - we hope to be back sooner than later!"
,,,,,,,,"Great first airbnb experience in a great town.  The condo is perfectly located in the heart of the downtown Austin action.  The area is safe, full of great restaurants and bars, packed with friendly people, and convenient to just about everything Austin has to offer -- including great trails for exercise.  The condo is clean and comfortable, and really provides an exceptional value for a group of friends.  Mark and Christy are courteous and professional communicators.  I will definitely consider staying in their condo again the next time I'm in Austin with friends."
,,,,,,,,"Everyone was impressed with the condo. It was easy to check in/check out as well. The convenience of location really helped, plus having a gated parking spot was awesome."
14410292,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great place to stay! Very nice and clean. Uzair was very helpful and accommodating, will definitely look to stay here again when in town!"
,,,,,,,,Good host!
5242421,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Jennifer was out of town but available by phone.  The bedrooms are small but the common areas were of good size so we could gather comfortably. The convenience store around the corner was great and the cafe across from it was excellent!  We only ate breakfast at home.  We walked to downtown several times and were able to get $8 rides there with Fasten when it was raining. 
,,,,,,,,"Clean comfortable convenient to downtown 
Great kitchen Great host
What more could want "
,,,,,,,,"Jennifer's house was so neat and cozy! We had three different couples and there was plenty of space for all of us. The best part of the house is that it is walkable to all the areas downtown and a short ride to lots of outdoor activities. Also, just a short walk to coffee and taco deli tacos! We would definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 136 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Jennifer's home! The house was welcoming, the beds were comfortable, and the neighborhood was charming. Great central location with all necessities within walking distance and downtown a quick Uber ride away. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect for what we needed! Very convenient location to downtown (Rainey or 6th street). If I come back with a group, I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"We loved the house, it was cute and comfortable! We loved cooking meals in the kitchen and it had a great front porch and nice backyard. The house had lots of Austin charm, we would stay here again next time we are in Austin! Jennifer was great at communicating and the house was very clean when we arrived."
6063670,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,9,A block from the Elephant Room and right across the street from WanderLust Yoga
,,,,,,,,Great spot to stay in central downtown Austin location. We loved the convenience and the place looks just like advertised. Easy in and out process and overall great stay! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Great value. Completely walkable for shops, art galleries, bars, restaurants, and music venues. Would stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"a one bedroom condo to yourself in downtown, keyless entry, in a beautiful community. I didn't meet the host and I enjoyed the private time here."
,,,,,,,,"This condo is in an outstanding location in downtown Austin. My booking was promptly accepted and all of the details were emailed to me almost immediately. Check-in was seamless: the door is pre-programmed with a code so you just show up and walk in!

The place was clean and generally well-appointed. I have been by the Railyard complex (where this unit is) many times and always been intrigued by the design. Even though it is in the middle of downtown Austin, it has a cozy feel and noise wasn't really an issue.

I was never able to get the Wifi to work reliably. Our welcome materials gave us two network options: one was unreliable (connections often timed out) and the other appeared and disappeared throughout my stay. I made the host and property manager aware but just received general responses such as ""We're looking into it"", ""there's nothing we can do"", and ""I'm on vacation"". 

My monthly trips to Austin are work retreats, and I've taken to staying at Airbnb's because private residential Internet is often much better than hotel internet. Given the location and design of the unit I'm sad that this unit didn't work out for me."
,,,,,,,,This apartment is one of the best locations for a visit to Austin. Walk to 6th and Rainey streets as well as many restaurants and sights. If you are coming on a quick weekend trip to Austin this is the place to stay.
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and Thomas were great to work with and very professional. I felt as if I were staying at a hotel. It was so easy to check-in and out since all you need to do is use the door code to access the apartment, which was great when our plane got delayed and we didn't make it there till after midnight. 

The location can't be beat! It was right in the middle of everything and we were able to walk to 6th street, South Congress and Rainey Street easily. I learned about all these great places to visit from Ryan's handy Things To Do List that he'll send you once you book. 

The apartment was clean and has all the amenities we needed. So glad we booked this place instead of one of the hotels nearby since we had so much more space and the price was half of what it would have been to stay in a tiny hotel room. "
,,,,,,,,Check in was easy and the apartment was clean and very well located. 
,,,,,,,,The garden suite was in a great location and well set up for visitors. Great information was sent by Ryan prior to our arrival.
,,,,,,,,"Great experience and location. Thank you, Ryan!"
,,,,,,,,"The location is very convenient to the downtown area. The house itself was clean and well maintained.

The big let down for me was the WiFi. I was there for a business trip and WiFi was very important. I even checked with Ryan to make sure his WiFi was good before completing the booking. 

But the WiFi was either constantly down or too slow to be usable (in spite of there being 2 WiFi networks). It was super frustrating, and at one point, I was even sending messages to the technician, Moses, to fix these issues! While he did come by, the issues were still not completely fixed and I had connectivity challenges during all the days I was there. I finally ended up doing my important work by hot-spotting through my phone on cellular.

I will be visiting Austin again for business, but will not be staying here."
,,,,,,,,Great Apartment in an amazing location.  Host provided a ton of information prior to arrival. Apartment was clean and everthing as described. 
,,,,,,,,"Location was great, Communication was good and apartment was comfortable.  "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's property was awesome! It's in a great area with a lot of fantastic bars and restaurants, and is in walking distance of many of downtown's awesome areas. I'd absolutely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic property - spacious, clean, very inviting. All the little details were in place. The pool is particularly gorgeous. It was such an easy walk to everything downtown, which was great because I didn't have to carry too much with me when I went out because it was so easy to jet back. The hosts were very helpful, especially because I was an Air B&B newbie. They really made it easy! "
,,,,,,,,"Great hosts. Excellent location - right in downtown, steps to 6th street, restaurants, short walk to Lady Bird Lake. Nice little pool, comfortable bed, perfect for a two-night stay where we wanted to get out and explore the city with our eight month old. Check in instructions were clear, a parking spot was included, and Ryan even included a pack and play at our request. Couldn't have been easier or more convenient. "
,,,,,,,,"Spacious 1 bedroom apt, great for 1-3 ppl. Only 1 full bed though, good for 1-2 ppl and couch good for 1, opens up. Location cannot be beat! "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exactly like we expected from the pictures and description. The location downtown is amazing, walking distance to great restaurants, bars, and entertainment. "
,,,,,,,,Amaizng location and a really nice flat! Clean and walk away from the main attractions! Ryan arranged the keys and everything before we arrived and we did not have to worry about anything at all! Fabulous host and place too! I would highly recommend!  
,,,,,,,,The location of this apartment couldn't be beat.  We were walking distance away from Rainey Street and Sixth Street.  It was also a great place to come back to after a day out exploring Austin.  The apartment was very clean and it had everything we needed.  
,,,,,,,,Love Airb&b - follow Ryan's example of customer experience and never stay in hotel again. Just perfection 
,,,,,,,,Love the extra touch Ryan does to make you whole experience incredible 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's apartment was perfect. My two friends and I visited and had plenty of space in this lovely apartment. It was just as expected and the location was exceptional -- I don't think we could have been in a better location. It's walking distance to Sixth Street, Congress, and Rainy and there were plenty of great restaurants around too. Ryan was quick to respond and so accommodating to anything we needed. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan is a super attentive host and responds to all queries super fast. Everything was neat and tidy in the apartment and well organised so you had everything you needed. Great downtown location, perfect for the convention centre and the nightlife. "
,,,,,,,,"The listing was spot on which was for a nice sized one bedroom apartment, in downtown Austin, which was convenient to both restaurants and office buildings.  Very well maintained and for someone that loves hotels, I would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan is the most amazing host I've met  thus far. His rentals are immaculate and the pictures he posted do not do justice to his amazing condos! I came down with an entire bridal party for a wedding at the Four Seasons and we were worried that where we were staying would not compare. We all came back to change and everyone was so upset that they had not rented as we did. This place is over the top and more. It was so clean,  modern and spacious. Ryan was so accommodating and so kind. Even when we texted him mid-trip, he was immediately available, never bothered and was so nice. Only regret was not meeting him on our trip. Thanks so much,Ryan!! "
,,,,,,,,Location was perfect.  Could not have asked for a better host.  Ryan was very attentive and was very helpful.  The condo was very nice and had everything you needed.  Thanks for helping making our trip to Austin awesome.
,,,,,,,,"Great location, clean apartment."
,,,,,,,,Always a pleasure staying at one of Ryan's properties!! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location in downtown Austin! The home was well kept, well organized and maintained, perfect for a vacation home away from home!

Ryan and Thomas were very responsive and great hosts! Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,The house was really nice and in a great location in downtown Austin. Everything was welcoming and helpful and I'd definitely recommend staying here.
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment. Plenty of space for three of us, very clean and had everything you could need. The location was perfect - walking distance to all the main areas you want to check out in downtown. 
We didn't interact much at all with the host Ryan, but that's because we didn't need to. And the guide he provided for the city was very comprehensive and helpful.
If I go back to Austin I would absolutely look to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great. Easy access, walking distance to 6th street, and the complex was nice! Wish we would've been staying longer instead of visiting on a quick trip. Ryan was helpful and not overbearing. "
,,,,,,,,Perfect location next to 6th street. House was clean and in good condition.
,,,,,,,,Awesome place. Fantastic location. 
222986,5,10,10,10,9,10,9,"Lyon was great! There was no one in the house when we arrived so allowed for early check in which was helpful with such a large group. We were out and exploring the city a lot and he was always available for a quick text. Loved the neighborhood. Walking distance to cute cafes and a short ride to downtown and Conress. Would 100% stay here again, hope to come back soon!!"
,,,,,,,,"WOW!!!  This was an amazing experience.  From my arrival at the front door until I reluctantly checked out, the property was incredible and Lyon was an exceptional host.

His binder with information was worth it's weight in gold.  I had family members staying in other properties who coveted the recommendations, the insights, and little tips included.  Lyon turned me onto FARE, instacart for grocery shopping and the best food trucks.

The house exceeded my expectaions with it's amenities, the cleanliness and comfort.  I would happily make it my permanent home!!!!

There were snacks and beverages awaiting us until we could make it out to shop.

Don't hesitate on this one, because it is worth every penny!!!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a wonderful home, perfect for a large group who want to stay in a lovely place!  Lyon is a terrific host, and the house had everything (and more!) that we needed.  The house is walkable or a short drive to some great restaurants and bars, and downtown Austin / SoCo is a short drive.  We were 6 adults, and we had tons of space and enjoyed just hanging out in the house with its lovely furnishings.  Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first AirBnB experience and Lyon has definitely set the bar high!  From my initial inquiry through check-out, Lyon has been extremely responsive, exceptionally accommodating, and absolutely flexible.  The house exceeded our group's expectations - everything was so beautifully decorated, meticulously organized (there were handy labels everywhere!), and comfortably welcoming.  We were spoiled by all of the amenities - from the sunroom, to the outdoor decks, to the sauna in the bathroom, to the gorgeous bar and dining area (which included beers and snacks on the house).  Oh, and the magical book!  Lyon has a wealth of information about various restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc. in different neighborhoods that we referenced on multiple occasions (despite our prior research of Austin).  I can't thank Lyon enough for making us feel so welcome and allowing us to truly experience a home away from our homes during our short stay in Austin.  I would definitely recommend Lyon as a host and would gladly stay in this beautiful house again!"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon is awesome! He welcomed me and my girlfriends for a long weekend stay in his lovely Austin home. His home is impeccably clean (no dust anywhere!), every detail is well thought out to provide for a comfortable stay (including drinks and snacks and all products needed in a bathroom such as Aveda shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair dryer etc.), and the neighborhood is quaint. We had a lovely time staying at Lyon's home in Austin and he gave us wonderful suggestions on where to eat in the area. Thanks Lyon! We adored our time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Our group had a great time staying at this house. Prior to arriving, Lyon offered advice on activities and where to make reservations. He was flexible with our check in since we were arriving early in the day. Lyon met us when we arrived at the house and walked us through his beautiful home. The home had plenty of space for 7 girls there for a bachelorette party. Even the sofa bed was comfortable! Lyon also provided snacks and coffee for us. 

The location of the house was great with plenty of places nearby to walk to. It was also a short uber ride to Congress and 6th street areas.

I would definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was a fantastic host!! It was our first time to Austin and Lyon greeted us at the door upon our arrival and right off the back made us feel so welcomed.  He recommended places to eat, get coffee, shop at, and different bars.  He was so willing to share his knowledge of his hometown and it made all the difference.  Not only was he an amazing host, but his property was gorgeous! Our entire weekend, we were all so shocked about how cute and well kept the house was.  It had such a homey feel and was a the perfect getaway.  I would definitely come back and rent from Lyon any day of the year! "
,,,,,,,,"We loved this home. This was our first experience using airbnb, and Lyon made the process very easy and welcoming. The location is perfect, ideal for our girl's weekend, especially when we wanted a quiet neighborhood and to be a part of the local Austin scene. Lyon was gracious and extremely informative about the area, dining, bars, music, parks, and trails, as well as the safety in walking around Austin. We would come back!!"
,,,,,,,,This was my first experience with airbnb but from the start I had been emailing with Lyon who quickly answered all my questions and gave me excellent recommendations.  His house is amazing.  It was decorated so beautifully and had everything you could ever think you may have forgotten on a trip.  The house was close enough to everything and in a neighborhood with food trucks and up-and-coming restaurants.  The house manual was helpful to reference for more recommendations and guidelines. I would highly recommend Lyon's adorable Austin abode to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,Lyon's house was beautiful and perfect for our gathering of 7 college friends. Lyon gave us great info about the area and left a book with listings for restaurants around town. The location was perfect for exploring Austin. Lots of things to walk to and just a short drive to downtown. You'll have everything you need in this house. I would highly recommend it.
,,,,,,,,"Don't hesitate to book this listing! This house is comfortable, convenient and completely stunning. From the perfectly curated furnishings (including some designer pieces and lovely antiques) to the thoughtful conveniences (sodas in the fridge and ergonomic extra pillows) you may find that your stay here is so much more luxurious than your own home that you won't want to leave. And Lyon is always the perfect host, making himself available when you ask for his wonderful advice on touring Austin, and becoming scarce once you've found your bearings--just the right amount of availability. Before a fun night out, be sure to enjoy a pre-taco-truck dinner cocktail in the beautiful dining room...any type of glass you might need will be available.  In the morning, jump in the steam shower to refresh. Then grab a perfect cup of coffee and a super soft extra blanket and curl up on the couch to watch a plethora of tv channels. Don't forget though, Austin is calling! This house has it all and in the city with it all.  Just a short walk to all the famous streets: Rainey, 6th and East 6th. But if walking isn't your thing, simply Uber or have one of the bike rental places deliver your wheels. Bottom line, this house is so convenient your car is easily forgotten. Go kayak the lake, jump in the frigid waters of Barton Springs or hike the Green Belt, there's so much to see and do! When you're sufficiently worn out, head home to your quiet oasis and get an amazing night's sleep on your memory foam mattress. Austin is one of the best cities in the world, why not stay in the best house to match?"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was a fantastic host! We were in Austin for a bachelorette party and 7 of us stayed at Lyon's home for the weekend.  The house was beautiful and perfect for a group our size.  Lyon was very accommodating, assisting us before our arrival by being available for grocery and alcohol delivery and providing great recommendations for the weekend.  While there, unfortunately the air conditioning had a breakdown but Lyon came over quickly to help fix it and even offered up his other rental next door when the air wouldn't come back on.  

The location of the house was perfect and a short cab ride or walk to many of the areas we had hoped to visit while in town.  Lyon even had an extensive book of recommended restaurants, bars and attractions to see while in town which helped round out our visit.  

We had a great time in Austin and would love to stay here again when in town! 

Thanks Lyon!"
,,,,,,,,"Little things make a big difference... and that could not be more true than for the experience you will have with Lyon and this home. He has thought of everything a guest might need or that might help to make a visit feel a little extra special. We were a group of 7 women that get together every year and were looking forward to exploring Austin. Most of us were new to Austin, and Lyon was extremely helpful and responsive to my questions about specific areas and restaurants. The home was perfect -- perfectly clean, fantastic patios, and tons of little things to make you feel at home. Lyon has thought of everything. It also provides easy access to so many areas of the city and is walkable to many great restaurants. We loved the nearby food trailers, Rainey Street, Congress Street, and paddle boarding. As one friend stated, 'We hit a home run with this house!' Thanks, Lyon!"
,,,,,,,,"Six of recently stayed here for a guys' weekend.  Lyon was fantastic prior to the stay; giving us a very thorough guide to Austin and some of the places we might enjoy visiting.  I was not present for check-in, but from speaking with my friend whom he met, Lyon was very welcoming and a great tour guide.  We anticipated spending most of time out and about, but because the house was so nice, we spent a lot of time in the common areas.  Everything about the house was great, from the very comfortable beds, to the enclosed porch, and the dining room.  The house is also very centrally located to many of the places of town to explore, including Rainey Street and 6th Street. I highly recommend Lyon's house if you are planning a trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Seven of us recently stayed here for an Austin weekend and absolutely loved it. This place is perfect if you're looking for a fun weekend out in Austin.

Lyon is an incredible host. He was very flexible with our group's check-in time and had a wealth of knowledge about the best restaurants, bars, and activities to do in the area - all in a convenient binder for future reference! 

The house itself was also great. There are multiple decks, a backyard patio, and nice furnishings. It's also well-positioned if you're in town for food an drink. It's an easy walk to bars on both East 6th Street and on Rainey Street. It's also nearby a lot of other fantastic restaurants."
,,,,,,,,Our family had a wonderful time during our visit to Austin. The house was better than expected and Lyon was a great host.  Plenty of room for the six of us that stayed there.  Very nice accommodations.  We love to cook as a family and enjoyed using the kitchen and it's amenities.  The neighborhood was fun to explore and close to downtown with easy access to the airport.  We would definitely do it again.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Lyon's place. Well located, beautiful home, great host. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Lyon's house couldn't have been better! He was so helpful in recommendations and support prior to our stay and even met us at the door when we arrived.  Lyon supplied us with snacks and drinks (included) which was much appreciated by all of the ladies in our party.  Every recommendation for food and drink in the area was perfect! The house was even better then the pictures; we especially enjoyed sitting out on the deck! Lyon's house is located in walking distance to great foodtrucks, coffee shops, and some fabulous restaurants-we couldn't have had a better time!  Urber was super easy around the area and we never waited more then a few minutes to get a ride.  We had a great girls weekend in Austin; I would recommend Lyon's house to anyone-a perfect host!
"
,,,,,,,,"Lyons house was so perfect for a girls trip this past weekend! Everything was as described; clean, spacious, lots of room, and plenty of outdoor space. Lyon greeted us as we checked-in and told us about some great places to see while in Austin. We felt extremely welcome. We could walk and ride our bikes to everywhere we planned to go. The location couldn't have been more perfect. The trail along the river was also very close. We were told there was a tenant in his other house behind ours but we didn't see him once. It was an all together great experience and I would definitely stay here again!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was a fantastic host. He made sure myself and my friends felt welcomed and gave us recommendations to made sure our stay went well. The house was beautiful, spacious and kept immaculate as seen in the pictures. He provides you with all the amenities you need and then some (even stocked the house with some snacks and sodas). I would definitely stay here again with friends. Neighborhood was great too and very close to the action on 6th street. "
,,,,,,,,"House was perfect for 3 couples in Houston for the Ironman. All three bedrooms are very nice--nobody felt like they got short shrift. House is SUPER clean with all of the amenities we could possibly have needed.  Location is very convenient for trail and wandering around downtown. Best part of experience was Lyon. Fantastic host. Welcoming, friendly, informative and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"A glorious, comfortable clean and well equipped house, perfectly placed for enjoying all that Austin has to offer. From first contact to final departure, Lyon welcomed us with advice, recommendations and gentle good humour. A great stay, with a fine host.
"
,,,,,,,,I would highly recommend staying here. We had a group of eight folks and booked both the main house and the additional bungalow. The location was perfect. The house was impeccably clean. We were able to walk to both Rainey Street and other East Austin spots. And Lyon was a wonderful host. He was very accommodating and responsive to our questions. The house was perfect and had a wonderful outdoor space. We couldn't have asked for a better stay. 
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was extremely accommodating! He made sure we were able to get into the house and showed us around making sure we got a quick tour of everything we might want to use or need. The area was in great walking distance to bars and restaurants and at night it was peaceful and quiet. The house was AMAZING and beautiful with anything you could ever possibly want, including paper umbrellas!"
,,,,,,,,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at the house for a guy's weekend (5 people in total). I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. Impeccably clean house, great outdoor space (the screened-in porch is a great perk) and Lyon is a great host. He left out a number of snacks (and some left-over beers) and gave us excellent recommendations for places to visit in Austin. When I told him that we would be going boating for the day, he went out of his way to lend us a cooler. Also, great location - easy walk to 6th street, Rainey Street, Downtown, etc. Could not be happier about our stay. Thanks again, Lyon. "
,,,,,,,,"My extended family stayed at the Luxe Spa House for my daughter's UT graduation last week and I stayed in the Bungalow on the property. Having the entire property to ourselves was fantastic. It worked out amazingly well. Everyone had their privacyâ€¦my sister and her husband, my niece and her husband and their three young children were extremely comfortable. Lyon has provided every possible amenity to make the house both luxurious and practical.  The outdoor spaces are great- and  when some flies began bugging us, the screened porch was ideal.
Lyon is very organized and thoughtful- available to answer questions, make recommendation and provide an extra cooler when asked.  Everyone had a wonderful weekend, in large part due this exceptional property and Lyon."
,,,,,,,,"Our group of Austin neophytes were thoroughly pleased with this beautiful home, and proximate location to East Austin, Rainey, and Downtown. Everything you would need has been carefully provided, from extra linens and heaps of coffee, to an entire drawer full of soap! Our 8-person group of 30-year olds were fully accommodated, and the outdoor spaces would have been more utilized had it not been for the mozzies. One  piece of information that would have been appreciated is that there is a separate bungalow directly facing the back porch with shared patio, rentable to other guests. "
,,,,,,,,"Five friends and I stayed here in April 2014.  Everything was absolutely perfect. First of all, the house itself (decorations, furnishes, finishes) are impeccable.  Not to mention great outdoor space to eat, drink and relax.  The bedrooms are all separated enough to allow for plenty of privacy.  The beds and linens were so comfortable.  It literally is really like a ""spa"".  

The location was also great.  I was a little skeptical at first because it seemed a bit far from DT, but there are plenty of super hip bars with a 10 minute walk and downtown was a 30 minute-ish walk, but an even faster bus ride (there are several bus stops within a block of the house and the bus was very easy to use).

Lyon was a fantastic host. He basically gave us an orientation on Austin when we arrived, telling us all the best places to hit up and what the ""too-touristy"" spots to avoid were.  He had the place stocked with sodas, waters, beer, snacks - the works!  We wanted for nothing.

I would not think twice about returning to Austin and staying here.  It could not have been more perfect."
,,,,,,,,"We couldnâ€™t have asked for anything more in a house. Lyon was a very kind and informative host. The house was well stocked with snacks, beverages, linens, and towels and comfortably slept 5 people. Most importantly, it was a short walk to most all of the events we attended at SXSW, without being in the thick of the action. We would certainly recommend Lyon Gegenheimerâ€™s residence to anyone staying in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon's Luxe Spa House to put simply, was perfect! A group of 6 girls stayed there for a girls bachlorette weekend and it could not have been more perfect. The house is gorgeous, updated and very welcoming. The neighborhood was close to everything and we walked to quite a bit during the day, as we had gorgeous weather on our side. Delicious coffee is right around the corner and Lady Bird Lake was a quick 10minute walk. From there we continued on the lake path and ended up on Rainey Street, at a place recommended by Lyon (Banger's). On another day we walked to check out 6th street and you can even walk to the famous Franklin BBQ (about a mile away). 

The house itself as mentioned, is updated without missing a single detail, including a few welcoming snacks to start you off. The kitchen has everything you need if you want to have a meal at home, as we did. The steam shower is the master suite is a must and sadly we were to busy to take advantage of the spa bath tub in the main bathroom. The beds are extremely comfortable and the 3 outside areas make it easy to relax.

Lyon was very welcoming and gave us wonderful recommendations in the area, many of which me tried through the weekend. We are all ready to go back and would pick Lyon's home again, without any reservation. It was truly a wonderful home away from home in a perfect location! "
,,,,,,,,Lyon was a wonderful and welcoming host. He was extremely hospitable and the house was very well equipped with everything we needed. Lyon even stocked some treats in the fridge for us! We had such a great stay and can't wait to go back!
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Lyon's house with a group of 7 people.  Lyon was super friendly, easy to deal with and gave us a lot of great recommendations for things to do in Austin.  His house was beautiful, well maintained and had a lot of thoughtful touches (a steam sauna in the shower, a large variety of cups, shampoo/soap, snacks, etc.).  It was plenty of space for our group!  The house is well located near 6th street/Rainey street.  It is walking distance on a nice day or in the case of cold/inclement weather (like we encountered) only a 5 minute cab ride away from these places.  I definitely recommend staying at this property."
,,,,,,,,"Our visit was fantastic.  The house is gorgeous and immaculate. Lyon was incredibly hospitable, including great local recommendations and a well stocked home.  He had thought of everything!  I definitely hope to come back soon!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience on airbnb and Its was awesome.  I couldn't have asked for a better stay.  When we arrived Lyon was kind enough to give us a rundown of the city and point out some local hot spots.  The house was super clean and stocked well beyond my expectations, nicer then many of the hotels I have stayed in.  If I am ever back in Austin I will make sure to book with Lyon."
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a fantastic stay. Perfect house for our getaway weekend! Clean, super comfortable, and we really loved all the outdoor spaces. Plus our host was a real pleasure to work with.  "
,,,,,,,,"Lyon's hospitality was outstanding.  He greeted us and showed us around his amazing home.  Lyon shared many valuable tips about Austin that made our stay much more interesting.  Lyon has thought of everything needed to make a guest feel welcome, at home, and happy that they decided to rent a house.  Each space in his home has been given much thought.  It is so beautiful!  This house is spacious, clean, beautifully designed and decorated.   The side effect was that both of my teenagers came home and got rid of clutter in their rooms!  I love it!  Looking forward to our next stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon's home is lovely. Excellent taste and very very comfortable. He was very helpful when we arrived, providing good explanations and advice about the home and the area. He lives just 2 doors away, so is available if anything came up, but at the same time, not intrusive in the slightest. Thanks for a wonderful trip and great memories"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon's home was relaxing, super clean, and had everything we needed for our five night stay.  Lyon was incredibly friendly and offered many great suggestions for our stay.  "
,,,,,,,,"We were 5 colleagues from Norway staying at Lyon's place during SXSW in 2013, and we had an amazing time. The place is located in maybe the best location of them all for being near the conference and city centre, and still it's in a very quiet and cozy neighborhood. It's walking distance from the convetion center and tons of great restaurants / bars.

Lyon was so kind to give us a ride to pick up bikes we could hire, which really improved our stay; it's great getting around by bike in Austin.

The house was perfect. Lyon got an eye for details, with snacks, drinks, comfortable beds, excellent steam showers, and a very clean house waiting for us.

Stay here if you get the chance! It will make you're Austin-experience a great one."
,,,,,,,,"This house was a fantastic find.  It looks somewhat modest from the front, but it is surprisingly large when you enter and Lyon has clearly put a lot of time and energy into the place.  There are two outdoor deck areas and a large sun room, all of which were great for me and six of my friends to hang out and catch up during a mini college reunion.  The master bedroom has its own outdoor access s well as a really nice steam room.  The location was great, very close to lots of good E. Austin restaurants and bars and a 20 minute walk or so to the heart of downtown.  Cabs were pretty easy to call as well.  I highly recommend this house and will strongly consider returning on my next visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay.  Absolutely no complaints.
,,,,,,,,"We walked into a house that rivals some of the best hotels. It was incredibly cozy yet practical. The layout is great and perfect for couples and friends. All the appliances are modern and work very well. The beds, linens and other amenities are great. The two (2) partios are lovely and the bar is excellent!  Lyon does a great job of giving visitors information about the area and is great to work with regarding meeting up and getting the most out of your stay. Our group definitely hopes to stay here again. Thank you for a great first visit to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Lyon's home was beautiful, spacious, and well suited for entertaining or just hanging out with friends. Lyon was a gracious host - he was very easy to work with, understanding, and the entire experience was trouble free. The house was within walking distance of new districts of E Sixth Street and Lustre Pearl, and pedicabs hit his neighborhood as well. 

Not to mention, his home was about a 3 minute drive from Juan in a Million. Hard to beat that.

Thanks so much Lyon - we'd be happy to stay there again.
"
,,,,,,,,"Lyon was super responsive and extremely helpful in giving us recommendations for good places to eat and drink in the area.  The house was also beautiful! The pictures did not do it justice.  All in all, this was a very positive experience for my first time using Airbnb. Thanks, Lyon!"
,,,,,,,,"This house is choice. Lyon is hands off and yet quick to respond to inquiries: a double threat. Neighbors don't like a lot of noise, and may be vocal with complaints, but hey: That's a small price to pay for high-quality leisure. Awesome steam shower in master bed is worth the price alone. Trust me.

It's an excellent time. Well worth it. Much love to the Circa 1899 Spa House."
,,,,,,,,"The location, amenities, and overall experience was fantastic. Couldn't recommend this place enough."
,,,,,,,,"We came to Austin for a work trip and stayed in the Circa 1899 Luxe Spa House, it was a truly relaxing getaway after a long day of work.  The homeowner was so nice and a quick responder.  I got the pleasure of meeting the homeowner one night when he was out watering the plants, and he was as nice as he seemed in all the emails and texts.  He left snacks and drinks for us, that is the first time I've seen someone do that at an Airbnb house, how thoughtful!  I would definitely recommend this house to anyone.  "
,,,,,,,,"This house is lovely and beautifully appointed. Lyon has stocked the rooms with oodles of drinking vessels, plenty of kitchen tools and small appliances, quality toiletries, and unexpected touches (such as umbrellas, frisbees, playing cards, cold beer in the fridge, various snacks and condiments). There was plenty of space for our group of seven, and though we sent most of our time out and about, we had no trouble relaxing on the cocktail deck, lounging in the living area and porch, and gathering around the dining table. Lyon was easy-going and full of great suggestions for eating, drinking, and entertainment. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"WOW!  This house is incredible.  I was 1 of 8 guys staying here for a bachelor party and everyone was floored.  We took full advantage of the front and back porch, the wet bar, big screen tv, etc!  Location is perfect, not far from the downtown scene (we took pedi cabs everywhere)!  Lyon was a great host - house was CLEAN, stocked with some snacks, drinks, cards, umbrellas...everything you could want.  I HIGHLY reccomend and would absolutely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,the property owners were quite helpful before and during our stay. the house is lovely. i rented this house as well as the adjoining casita at the rear of the property and used it as a media center for my company for 11 days during sxsw 2012. for details on how the house functions in this capacity feel free to hit me up on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) @vans_66.
,,,,,,,,The house was absolutely perfect. A great location and a beautiful home. I would highly recommend staying there. 
,,,,,,,,"Wow! I cannot say enough about this place - it is more beautiful than can be captured in pictures.  Every space in this house has a unique feel and creative vibe.  My friends and I appreciated the attention to detail - there are some thoughtful features including plush rugs, comfortable and oh so soft sheets, such comfortable beds, thick delicious-smelling towels, luxury shampoos and other bathroom amenities, even mixers for drinks and snacks too!  Lyon was so easy to work with - and responded very quickly to all of my questions and requests.  I appreciated his recommendations for near-by restaurants and his update about events that were happening during our visit.  At the end of each day of our visit to Austin, my friends and I were just excited to get back to ""our"" gorgeous, spacious house for the evening! This is a wonderful space - I cannot recommend it enough.  Stay here and you will not be disappointed.  "
14844479,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Very happy with this place. Easy to check in. Location is great and is in walking distance of both 6th Street and Rainey Street.
,,,,,,,,Chris was very welcoming and provided us with a seamless experience. You can't beat this location in Austin. I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,Host did a great job of communication and the listing was accurate. He was very friendly and mad us feel welcome. We had a great stay and the location was perfect for what we needed. I would recommend to anyone traveling to Austin with a larger sized group. 
,,,,,,,,Great. Chris was very helpful and accommodating. The place was perfect and we easily made it comfortable for our entire group.
,,,,,,,,Chris has it set up so it is super easy to come and go even with a big group - no need to worry about keys. The place is spacious and quite nice. Location is unbeatable for a maximizing your time in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location, and excelent place, definitly i'll stay here on my next trip to Austin. The photos on the listing do not give the real value and comfort of the condo. Chris even prepare a folder with instructions of everything and even ordering menus, I really apreciate that. Hope to stay in this place soon! "
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, but very new and there were some logistics problems such as the wrong wifi password, aluminum pans that didn't work with the induction cooktop, a dryer that didn't work well, and parking spaces that may or may not belong to the unit.  Chris was very helpful and did what he could to make our stay comfortable.  The place is in a great location and it's nice for large groups or families.  Given, most of this stuff should be sorted out shortly, I would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Chris's place was exactly as described, comfortable, and in an awesome location. Chris was very responsive and helpful with all of our questions before, during, and after our stay. We had an absolute blast staying here and would definitely recommend it to all coming to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,This place was amazing and exactly what I was looking for. Spent the weekend with some friends to check out Austin and it was the perfect location. We are already planning another trip down and will be looking to book here again.
,,,,,,,,Chris was an awesome host who did whatever he could to make sure I had a great stay. The place is amazing and is in a great location. I definitely recommend staying here. I will definitely be back on my next visit. Chris....thanks again for being such a great host! 
7909952,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Great spot, appears as in pics, very comfortable stay. "
,,,,,,,,"This home is the perfect get away! Quiet, clean, and very cute! Neighborhood has everything you need within walking distance. Even super cute restaurants and a great coffee shop! The owners are quick to respond and very friendly. I highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,"Visited Austin for a wedding and made a long weekend out of it. We were two couples that stayed for 4 nights. There was plenty of space for all of us in Charlotte's guest house, it's is exactly as described: quiet, charming and very conveniently located. We had a car for main transportation, but walked to Medici Coffee House in the mornings and Zocalo for lunch. It's a very beautiful neighborhood and a really amazing city. Pretty much felt like we were one mile from everything. Charlotte was so kind and accommodating, really made our stay quite pleasant. Would definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,"The place is definitely bigger than I expected. Plenty of room for at least 4 guests. Charlotte was so kind and accommodating making my stay so pleasant. It's right in the heart of everything with minutes drives and walking to some really cool dining options, 6th street, Rainey st, and soco. Can't wait to go back and stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful neighborhood! Wonderful host, so sweet to check in and make sure we comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Loved this place!  It was not only adorable but also very comfy & in a great central location for checking out all Austin has to offer.  It was well appointed & well stocked, there were even assorted things like sun screen that one might forget.  It's in a quiet neighborhood as well....just a really great place, highly recommend the place & the host!"
,,,,,,,,"The place is adorable and comfortable--great aesthetic, well laid out, with a great bed and shower in a really beautiful neighborhood. It's a wonderfully private little bungalow behind the main house, with an adorable gated patio out in front. Weather in Austin was ridiculously hot and humid. Excellent a/c.  A car is really a must in Austin, either rental or their Uber alternatives (there are several), or cab--I hadn't realized this. Charlotte was very generous, helpful, and kind. Including (but not limited to!) letting me stash my bag here after check-out (no guest coming immediately following my stay) so I could tour around Austin before my late flight. A great place to stay. Not immediately near downtown, but a $7 cab ride away. Charlotte's a great host. "
,,,,,,,,"Guest house was perfect for our needs.  We were able to come and go as our schedule required.  Charlotte and Tom were wonderful hosts and we would definitely recommend this to friends and would stay again ourselves.  Quiet neighborhood, private guest house, close to everything!  "
,,,,,,,,"Visited Austin with a friend and we were so happy with our stay.  The place was clean, spacious, and a perfect location!  "
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I wanted to take a fun, quick getaway to Austin and surrounding areas before his busy travel schedule begins in September.  We couldn't have selected a better spot than this Clarksville guest house! The location is convenient to so many parks, trendy restaurants, bars and shops. The guesthouse's floor layout was perfect for us with a kitchen, tv/living room, bedroom and bathroom. The decor was very tasteful and clean and fit perfectly with the theme of the cottage (loved the subway tiles and tile floors)! The neighborhood has lots of historic character and is quiet. We'll definitely seek this location out again when we return to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Very nice accommodation in a nice neighborhood convenient to downtown and UT.  Would recommend it without hesitation.
,,,,,,,,"We were moving a child into UT, and the location near Enfield and Mopac was absolutely perfect for us!  Charlotte was very welcoming, and we appreciated the off-street parking."
,,,,,,,,"Exactly what we were looking for. Clean and enough space and wonderful outside area with table and chairs.
Great location, great value for money, great communication and wonderful people if you get the chance to meet them.
Thank you for a wonderful stay and will absolutely stay again when in town.
"
,,,,,,,,Charlotte made easy arrangements for us to check-in. She had peaches and Topo Chico in the fridge. The guest house was perfect for our weekend in Austin. We'd definitely stay there again.
,,,,,,,,"My family and I stayed in Austin for 4 nights. It was perfect for us and our 3 small children. The central location was perfect for our day trips and evening outings. Charlotte was so nice and accommodating. 
We brought our own pack n plays for our twins and our 5yo slept on the sleeper sofa. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the plates, pans, & utensils that we needed. We also loved the separate fenced patio. And I loved that we could use the washer and dryer. With children, this is so helpful. 
The main ac cooled the house nicely as long as the inside doors were open for circulation.
Everything was neat, comfortable, & just was we needed for our stay."
,,,,,,,,"It's all in the details that set my experience staying w/ Charlotte apart from other places I've stayed while visiting a new city. The guesthouse is adorable, and tastefully furnished to give off a welcoming ""homey"" vibe from the moment you walk in. I particularly admired Charlotte's book collection and outdoor patio area. Aside from the guesthouse itself, the location was fantastic and only a short drive from anything happening in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"My mom and I enjoyed staying at this adorable little guest house. It was the perfect size and in a very convenient part of Austin to get to awesome restaurants, music, and great outdoor recreation spots. The house was very clean and Charlotte, her husband, and their adorable daughter were kind hosts!"
,,,,,,,," We felt completely welcomed. As a matter of fact, Charlotte went out of her way to have her lovely home ready for us much earlier then was initially stated.
 Charlotte's home was clean and comfortable. It was located in quiet safe neighborhood and within walking distance for all our needs i.e. food coffee dining.we certainly look forward to our next visit."
,,,,,,,,"Walked right in after a long day of travel and felt completely at home.
It had everything we needed and we were very pleased."
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay!  Very close to a lot of activities set within a peaceful neighborhood.  We were only there one night but enjoyed our quick visit!
"
,,,,,,,,"Charlotte and Tom's charming guesthouse really made our visit to Austin. We came to hear the music and wanted a nice place to feel relaxed during the day - not the formality of a hotel. Charlotte has gone out of her way to make this really lovely - the decor, artwork and myriad small touches that just make the place so nice. It was a perfect size. They live in a lovely neighbourhood full of the most beautiful giant trees, and just a few minutes walk from a good grocery store and a great selection of restaurants from upmarket, to casual and a fantastic coffee house, Medici. We didnt hire a car but chose to Uber around, which was btn $5-10 for our trips downtown to various music venues. But a real treat that is a must is to visit Zilker Park (Coleman Pools ?) and it is about a mile on from Barton Springs (captured part of the Colorado River in a very long swimming pool) which is also very special. But you must make the visit to the pools - beautiful cascading water - you feel like you many miles away from the city.  Also, good to pick up Austin cycles ($8 a day but dont gover the 30 mins when you have to return the bike and can pick up another one) The closest from Charlottes is on 12th St over Lamar.. Thanks Charlotte and Tom for a lovely stay! "
,,,,,,,,"This little guest house was perfect for a girls' trip to Austin!  It was nicely located in a cute neighborhood right outside the city, only a few minute Lyft ride downtown!

It had all the essentials - full kitchen, a comfortable feel, plenty of linens and towels, and was very clean.  We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return! :)"
,,,,,,,,"What a great experience! Charlotte was so hospitable and her guest house was immaculate. So many little details were considered that made us feel like home - products in the (super clean) bathroom, water in the fridge, you name it. We really felt like we got away for a few days staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay during our first visit to Austin.  Charlotte's adorable guest cottage was a wonderful fit for our family.  We were traveling wit(URL HIDDEN)yr old and were looking for a quiet place to stay in a convenient location.  The comfortable queen bed and pull out sofa in the living room, plus a pack n' play that we brought, worked perfectly for us.  It was really nice to be able to get up and make our own breakfast before heading out for the day to explore.  Off street parking right outside our door was a nice bonus.  My husband and I enjoyed sitting on the private, beautifully lit, rustic front porch at the end of the day.  The cottage has many original finishings preserved and is simply decorated with fun modern pieces.  Both the kitchen and bathroom are well appointed with all the basics, including lovely high quality linens.  We were impressed at how meticulous the cottage is kept from top to bottom.  Clarksville is a fantastic area in the heart of Austin.  The cottage is walking distance to a neighborhood grocery, great restaurants and a park.  Or a short drive to an endless list of activities and outstanding restaurants.  It's a historical neighborhood with an eclectic modern vibe.  We would highly consider staying at Charlotte's again when we make it back to Austin.  We wish we could have stayed longer.  Thank you for making our first visit a memorable experience."
,,,,,,,,"Charlotte was an amazing host.  She even put out fresh fruits for us and some beverages.  I was very impressed with how clean the place was and how we had extra towels, shampoo, soap and everything to use.  The place is very central to downtown austin and I would highly recommend her place, I was again very impressed with the level of service given at this home."
,,,,,,,,"Charlotte was great and very easy to communicate with.  The place was cute, clean, and light-filled - just as advertised!  "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Tom and Charlotte's guest house in the Clarksville area of Austin for a few days visiting family.  Perfect area - great neighborhood plus walking distance to restaurants, store, coffee shop, and parks including Zilker.  Only a few blocks from downtown.  Guest house is tastefully and creatively decorated with all the comforts of home.  We could live in a place like this!  Charlotte and Tom are great - interesting and outgoing.  We will stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Charlotte was great.  The neighborhood was centrally located for our needs and the restaurants were within walking distance. The house was super clean spacious.   We will definitely stay again.  Sweet family.
,,,,,,,,Charlotte was super helpful with her directions and even tips to get around the area. The guest house was perfect and everything I needed for my short work trip. Wouldn't have changed a thing and would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at Charlotte's casita! She was so easy to communicate with and everything was very comfortable. We would love to come back and stay with her. 
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend & I stayed here during our first trip to Austin and it was wonderful. So clean and cozy. We loved that it was close to the main attractions, but also in a cute neighborhood west of downtown with some peace & quiet. There are some delicious restaurants and a grocery store right down the street within walking distance. Everything is either a 5-10 min drive or a $6 uber away. The house itself was perfect. Stocked kitchen, cute living room, super clean bathroom, and very comfy bed with lots of pillows! I would live here if I could. Charlotte & her husband were also very accommodating and attentive to anything we needed! "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Charlotte's guest house was such an easy and calm experience, it was perfect for my business trip! It's a really cute space with everything you need and more. The bathroom was extremely clean (how can I get my own bathroom that clean?) and the bed was comfortable. Nice to have a filtered water pitcher in the fridge. The house sits on a quiet and cute street that's a cheap Uber ride to downtown Austin, so I could easily zip back and forth as much as I needed to.

I would definitely stay here again next time I visit Austin. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful experience! This is a beautiful quaint home in the perfect central location. A very clean and quiet get away with all the needed amenities. The hosts were quick to respond to questions and very cordial. Will be sure to stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Comfortable and clean space with the sweetest little patio out front. We had a wonderful stay! Thank you Charlotte!! :)
,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed my stay at Charlotte's guest house! I was in Austin for a conference at the convention center downtown. I rented a car so the location was perfect for me. It's close to some nice cafes and restaurants in Clarksville and took me 10 minutes to get downtown. The guest house itself is a perfect size for one or two people, it was clean and very nicely decorated. There was some construction going on next door during my stay but it wasn't a big deal since I wasn't around during the day. I never actually met Charlotte (her Husband met me when I arrived), she was extremely responsive and made sure my stay was perfect!"
,,,,,,,," The neighborhood was very nice and perfectly located just up from downtown.  Lots of privacy,  and the house was very clean and comfortable with a nice touch of character.  And Charlotte gave us some good recommendations on where to eat!"
,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed my stay at Charlotte's Airbnb guesthouse greatly! 

The neighborhood was cute and quiet. The house fit the three of us comfortably (and was well decorated to boot!) with a nice patio out front, too.  
We were able to come and go to various attractions pretty easily (average uber ride to / from the house was about $9 and average ride was about 5-15 minutes). While the house isn't in the most central location, it was more affordable than the airbnb options we looked at right downtown and with the added cost of ubers to get to / from places, we still made out really well. 

In terms of small details, Charlotte thought of them all. She left us a welcome note and some drinks and candies when we arrived. She left plenty of towels and linens (including spare towels and comforters) and had kitchen and bathroom essentials (coffee, creamer, toilet paper, toothpaste) for us. 

The space was also very well decorated and we had fun looking around at the books and artwork. 

I would definitely recommend this to a friend. It was easy enough to get to everywhere we wanted to go and Charlotte was very communicative and made it easy for us. Thank you!
"
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying at the guesthouse in Clarksville.  It is in a wonderful neighbourhood: green, leafy, relaxed, quiet, safe and a short walk to the river, Zilker Park, downtown area, and very near to fabulous local restaurants.  
The guest house itself is clean, bright, and well conditioned. The bedroom and bathrooms are nicely renovated and thoughtfully decorated with framed prints by local artists.
It was particularly nice to have our own entrance gate, parking area and private front yard, so that we weren't disturbing anyone.
It was a sheer pleasure to stay, Charlotte is an exceptional host, thoughtful, organised, considerate and lovely. Everything went very smoothly.  Basically, we can't recommend it any more highly.

Can't wait to head back to Austin and stay at Charlotte's guest house again, it can't come soon enough!"
,,,,,,,,"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Secluded back house in a gorgeous neighborhood, well furnished and tasteful with all the right amenities sprinkled in. Charlotte was a fantastic communicator from the very beginning and made us feel very welcomed. Also, the location could not be better. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a cozy retreat to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The guest house was super cute, and Charlotte and her husband were very hospitable. This house is in a great location...walking distance to Fresh Plus, and close to downtown, etc. The private outdoor area is also a plus. My friends and I had a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at the Clarsksville guest house was ideal. Charlotte and Tom were perfect hosts and made us feel at home. This place is centrally located in the best neighborhood, beautifully designed, and very comfortable. Less than a 5 minute walk to a great grocery store and all types of restaurants. It only takes 20 minutes to walk to Whole Foods, (start of downtown). We walked to Zilker Park and the hike and bike trail around Lake Austin - easy access via the Johnson Creek trail. This really is a house on its own. Quiet, private, yet in the heart of the city. And there is parking and easy access to the freeway and main streets of Austin. The fenced patio is huge (practically doubles the space) and surrounded by beautiful oak trees, it is a wonderful place to enjoy the pleasant Austin evenings.  We've been to Austin several times and this has by far been our favorite place to stay. "
5901889,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Majorie was very responsive to my request to add an additional guest.  She was available if needed.  My family met for a family vacation.  The home was warm, comfortable and inviting. My adult daughter said it felt like a home all of us could enjoy.  The bath products, towels and linens made us feel at home.  The kitchen  was adequately appointed so we enjoyed cooking breakfast. The location was perfect. Loved the grocery, coffee shop, park and restaurants nearby! The  large dining table provideed a place to play dominos and draw. Our only regret was the rainy weather that kept us from spending more time outside,"
,,,,,,,,"This house was perfect!! It was a big house with a cute backyard. We loved the decorations and big dinning room table. It is also by a bunch of restaurants and a grocery store. Marjorie was very responsive to communication. We rented a car to get around Austin and used RideAustin, Austin's version of uber, for nighttime outings. I would definitely recommend traveling to Austin and staying in this house. "
,,,,,,,,What a beautiful house! Great location. Highly recommend staying with Marjorie you'd be hard pressed to find a better spot in Austin 
,,,,,,,,"This is a really sweet, spacious house in a great neighborhood with easy walking distance access to so many interesting home grown small businesses that we didn't get a chance to visit them all during the week we were there! It has an awesome private backyard with two great bikes in very good condition, which we used to explore more of Austin farther out in a more up close and personal way than by car. Marjorie was the perfect host, very reachable, but also gave us all the privacy we needed. We'd definitely stay again! "
,,,,,,,,This was a fabulous house close to downtown and right next to Jeffrey's/Josephine's!  Great decor and all the amenities you would need! Marjorie even helped us by making the front entry way handicap accessible with a ramp.  Will definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"The Waterston House was SO perfect, I literally have zero complaints! Marjorie was so wonderful in communicating with us and making check in and check out easy! My jaw dropped when I opened the door and walked in and saw how beautifully decorated it was, and how clean it was (smells amazing in there too!) The kitchen was stocked with essentials, and we weren't really cooking there (had to take advantage of delicious Austin food scene!) so that wasn't a huge concern for us to begin with. 

The location was so clutch. Grocery store right across the street for easy beer and snack runs, delicious brunch place and pizza place right next door, cute coffee shop 4 min walk away that we'd walk the dog to every morning, and several more restaurants as you walk down W Lynn. The neighborhood felt safe, was quiet, and very friendly. Couldn't say enough good things about location. You won't be disappointed!

We also loved the backyard - there was no fire pit like pictured in the photos on the listing that we would have enjoyed in the evenings, but that wasn't a huge deal! There were corn hole sets, a nice sitting area, and the landscaping is beautiful. The restaurant right next door got a little noisy at night when they were closing up, but we were in the backyard enjoying the evening wide awake, so it wasn't a bother to us. 

I will never rent another place in Austin again that isn't the Waterston house. What an amazing rental experience! Thank you Marjorie for giving us such a wonderful weekend, we truly appreciate it! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay here in Austin. The house is exactly as pictured. We loved the screened in porch and hammock. The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and centrally located. We would stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Marjorie's home is wonderful. It's a great location, super clean & had everything we needed. I highly recommend staying at Waterston House b"
,,,,,,,,"A great house in a great spot. Tucked in a well-known but less well-traveled corner of Austin, this Clarksville home had everything we needed for a weekend, a week or a month. Next door to two West Austin icons, Jefferies and Josaphine House, the vibe of the Clarksville house - from the Blue accent door that's carried through the fireplace and chimney to the line trees in the back yard - was definitely West Austin. And, Marjorie was a great host. Attentive, responsive and welcoming. We loved the one week+ we stayed! Thanks Marjorie for the warm Texas hospitality! Recommend this house anytime you can get it. "
,,,,,,,,Loved this house!  Could not have asked for a better location. Steps away from a great grocery store and good restaurants. Excellent bath products were a nice touch. Highly recommend!!!
,,,,,,,,We loved staying at the Waterston House! Thanks for being such a great host Marjorie! 
,,,,,,,,"we went to Austin for a wedding and stayed with family. Even though we stayed real busy during our time there, it was the perfect house. Everything needed was there. Walking distance to groceries, pharmacy, coffee, and food! Majorie was helpful with our questions way before arival and quick response while at the home. I would recommend this home anyone. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at the Waterston House.  The home is spacious and cozy, perfectly clean, and was just right for me and my five friends.  The backyard garden was a beautiful spot to relax at dusk.  Marjorie was very nice and responsive when we needed anything."
,,,,,,,,Great home in a fantastic area!  Home is fully equipped for a long term stay...barbecue grill and bicycles were a bonus.  Marjorie is an awesome and responsive host!   We will be back soon!
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I have visited Austin for the same music festival for 5 years in a row and this was the best place we've ever stayed.  This year the festival was canceled the day before it was due to start and threatened to ruin our (and about 15k other people's) whole vacation.  If we hadn't stayed here we would have gone stir crazy in a hotel room or a smaller, less comfortable AirBnB.  Between that and just how cool of a wanderable city Austin is, we had a great time.  Clarksville is a very quiet, nice neighborhood with lots to do within walking distance.  Also close to 6th Street if that's your thing too. Marjorie was a great host although we didn't really need anything except to drop our bags off early on check-in day, which she happily obliged.

This place felt like the house I would want to buy if I moved to Austin (don't worry not-so-native Austinites I'm not going to)."
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"During our stay at the Waterston House my husband and I had an amazing time enjoying the surrounding neighborhoods and the charming home.  We fell in love with the Clarksville neighborhood and loved eating at the nearby restaurants. Marjorie was prompt to answer our questions, was considerate and professional, and not to mention her home is absolutely adorable. Everything in her home was clean, welcoming, homey, and our stay there made our time in Austin a true treat! We can't wait to come back and stay again."
,,,,,,,,Marjorie has a beautiful home that is perfectly located on the edge of town- just close enough to be walking distance from downtown but far enough away to be peaceful. There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants right next door.  I wish we could have stayed longer. My family and I had a great time.
,,,,,,,,"The Waterston House had all the amenities of home with a very nice backyard which we enjoyed later in the day.  In the neighborhood was a handy grocery store which sold just about anything one might need.  Also, enjoyed the top-notch restaurant next door for after dinner deserts and apÃ©ritifs, and the proximity to downtown Austin.  All together, a very nice stay.
"
,,,,,,,,"Marjorie's house was perfect for our stay. The house was clean, roomy, plenty of towels and toiletries to last us for our 3 days stay, beautiful, well groomed backyard and great neighborhood. We were there on business so didn't get as much time to enjoy the house and yard as we would have liked, but everything in the description of the property was accurate and I would highly recommend you stay here if you are looking for an airbnb in Austin. It was also next door to a super delicious cafe that we went to each morning. Their garden was in the front yard :)"
,,,,,,,,"Best airbnb we ever stayed in! Even though this was a house - the service and amenities made us feel like we were staying in a 5 star hotel. 
Right next door is the Josephine House, a farm-to-table restaurant where we enjoyed delicious meals. We found out they actually manage this airbnb, which made our experience so unique. We hope to come back next year during SXSW. Thank you Marjorie!"
,,,,,,,,"Marjorie's house was fantastic, and made our stay in Austin a comfortable and stress free one. I travelled with my dad during sxsw and we were looking for somewhere close to town but also an escape from the 6th st madness and I came through on both points. The house is lovely and has everything you need and the restaurants and supermarket are so close it's ridiculous. Also I recommend eating/drinking at Josephine's next door. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a fantastic stay with our 2 young kids at Waterston House.  The house was great, and Marjorie was easy to work with.  We really enjoyed the location as well, with a grocery store, coffee shop, and a couple of restaurants all right around the corner.  There's also a nice park/playground/pool a few blocks away.

One thing to note is that the house is right next to a restaurant, which means that there is noise generated by the people dining outside.  Even with the 2 young kids going to bed early we did not have a problem, as it is not super loud and the house had several very pleasant white noise machines.  I only mention this in case you are super sensitive to background noise."
,,,,,,,,"We rented Waterston House for 8 days while we moved my Mother from one apartment complex to another in Austin. At the end of very long days, we were always relieved to return to Waterston House and unwind. Living Room is very comfortable with big lived-in leather sofa, TV, dining table, and windows all around. Our dogs were happy with the sofa and people-watching out the windows while we were gone during the day. The Master bed is extremely comfortable - great pillows. Pretty and fenced back yard worked great for the dogs. While there is no grass (pea gravel only), there are many pretty plants and potted trees. Dogs did not seem to mind the pea gravel at all. We loved that Fresh Plus Grocery was across the street as well as Cipollina's (for fabulous pizza) and Josephine House restaurant was right next door. The house suited us perfectly by having our dogs with us and providing a laid-back respite from the move. We were delighted to meet Marjorie, the host, one afternoon and she was completely friendly and gracious."
,,,,,,,,"Marjorie made us feel very welcome and responded promptly to any questions. The house is a delightful 2 bedroom/2bath home with everything needed for a comfortable stay. The location is fantastic and  one can easily walk to the grocery, restaurants, a coffee shop and a quaint drug store with a soda fountain. This will be our 'Austin home' during future visits. "
,,,,,,,,"Marjorie was great and attentive to all of our needs. The house was just as described and was a nice way to spend the week of New Year in one of our favorite areas of Austin. The house is a good layout and the kitchen/living areas are large and easy to move around. It is convenient to everything you need, including several great places to eat and drink and a grocery store within 150 feet of the front door. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect for our Christmas weekend.  We thoroughly enjoyed the comfortable appointments and spacious kitchen. It was a tad drafty as it was an older house, but this being Austin that's not something you have to worry about but for one month out of the year. We had a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"I have no words nor enough life time to express how happy and satisfied me and my family were with this house and with Marjorie's patience and flexibility.
The house was clean, beautiful and became my family's home for 10 days, to the point that when they left, they felt sad and are hoping that next time they visit Austin, they get the amazing opportunity of staying here again.
Marjorie was so friendly and available all the time.  When we checked out, we realized my mother had left her insulin shots in the fridge.  I immediately called Marjorie and without hesitation allowed us to go back and picked it up.   Things like this, is what make this house and Marjorie the best place to stay in Austin.
This experience is what Austin is really about:  friendly, caring, top notch quality, humane... I will always recommend this house and Marjorie and my and my family's gratitude will always be infinite."
,,,,,,,,"We have really enjoyed our stay at the Waterston House.
Everything was great.
"
,,,,,,,,"The Waterston House was an amazing place to stay in Austin. It's literally steps from a couple of restaurants and a local grocery store. The house gets a ton of natural light in the morning, the decor is super cute and the beds are very comfortable. 

You don't really need a car staying at this house. We took Uber every where in the city. It was about a $27 Uber ride from the airport to the house and a $10-$20 ride to South Congress Avenue or Rainy Street. 

I've already recommended The Waterston House to a couple of friends looking to visit Austin. You won't go wrong staying here."
,,,,,,,,"The house was amazing! It was more than we expected and really made our stay in Austin extra special. It had everything we needed, the location was awesome and Marjorie was a fantastic host. Always checked in to make sure we had everything we needed! Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"5 stars! Waterston House has a perfect central location with great restaurants right beside you and the coolest neighborhood market just across the street. It's a  great little house with comfy beds and a well~stocked kitchen,  so entertaining is a breeze! The backyard is fenced with outdoor furniture and  set up with a large grill ~great for gatherings!  Marjorie is a friendly,  competent and responsive host~a real pleasure to work with.  I highly recommend this house and will stay there again when I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Marjorie was great and we loved our weekend at the Waterston House! I would highly recommend this as a place to stay to anyone who is coming to Austin. It was centrally located, clean and provided us with everything we needed for a nice weekend getaway. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect house, best location in Austin! Couldn't pick a better place. "
,,,,,,,,"Marjorie was a dream to communicate with. Super easy to coordinate check in and check out times! This is my favorite neighborhood in Austin. We had the best time getting drinks at Josephine's House (the cutest restaurant in Austin) next door. It was also wonderful having the small grocery across the street and having the coffee shop, Cafe Medici. Wonderful area + home! "
,,,,,,,,Great house!
,,,,,,,,"Five of us stayed in the Waterson House for 4th July weekend and we absolutely loved it! It was very clean and nicely furnished, with great beds and very well equipped with basic food, kitchen utensils and towels.

It is in a fantastic location and neighbourhood in Austin, with plenty of driveway and on-road parking. 

There is a great grocery store 30 seconds walk away, useful for the
for the big grill in the nice back yard, equipped with a table, umbrella and chairs.

It was also very useful to have the pair of bikes at our disposal.

It was nice of Marjorie to stop by to say hello and check everything was okay on the first day, she was a pleasure to deal with.

I'd recommend this place to anyone, and for our first time in Texas we had a blast! 
"
,,,,,,,,"This was such a great place to stay! The house was super comfortable, felt like I was at home. Really modern but cosy, awesome environment! Location was great, 2 min from 6th and Lamar extremely nice neighborhood with gorgeous homes!
Marjorie was amazing to work with, great communication, we are for sure staying here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was so inviting and the perfect size for our week long staycation. Marjorie was great to deal with and the house had everything we needed to feel at home. Loved spending time on the front porch & the dogs enjoyed the fenced backyard. 
The only downside was the age of the house & our 9mth old baby :( you can hear patrons & staff talking at the restaurant from the bedrooms, especially the slamming service door in the back of the restaurant that's immediately outside the bedroom walls. It opened & closed all day & night. So my only advice is to families with little ones who nap :) our noise machine drowned out most of it but some things they just can't sleep through. 
Otherwise the house was perfect! Will recommend it to any large party coming to stay in our awesome city. Location, size & style were all great. "
,,,,,,,,"The Waterson House was the perfect spot for our week long visit to Austin. The house is large, comfortable and accommodating. We enjoyed cooking and spending time in the house almost as much as we enjoyed Austin. Marjorie was very friendly and communicative, she reached out several times to ensure that we were comfortable. The neighborhood is very walkable with restaurants, shops, and a grocery store nearby. I would recommend this house to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,We LOVED the house for our weekend in Austin with friends. The house was perfect and we couldn't have asked for a better location. We'll be back! 
,,,,,,,,We couldn't have found a better place for my friends' bachelorette party.  Centrally located and plenty of room for our group 5.  Marjorie was extremely flexible and even helped us find parking for our group.  Such a charming place!!!
1499714,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"The apartment was in a great location- close to the places we frequented. The cafe and juice bar were both wonderful and open early which was handy. We  had 3 people, so would have preferred a place with a separate bedroom and that wasn't clear from the profile. Everything was clean and adequate, but we didn't feel like the place had much character. The photos made it look newer than it was. "
,,,,,,,,"Close to some clutch food carts and reasonably close to downtown.  Nothing amazing, but a solid stay in Austin.  Plus, the Cenote is a nice little cafe."
,,,,,,,,Great little spot in the heart of Austin. Love how Cenote is a few paces away from the front door! Would recommend.
,,,,,,,,"He reached out a week before out trip and have perfect instructions ..The place exactly met the pictures and was very clean !
The instructions were stuck on the fridge and was helpful
The place was close to every place we wanted to visit which made the commute so easy 
Will definitely stay again "
,,,,,,,,Very accommodating spot!
,,,,,,,,"The Cenote Cafe is a really great pace to grab a bite or a drink just about any time of day. Very friendly staff and great food. The apartment has ample space to call home for a few days. The Bed was comfortable and there was little if any ""city noise"". The convention hall is a short 5-10 minute walk. There are several trendy restaurants and bars nearby. I'll certainly be back when I work in Austin again."
,,,,,,,,The Cenote Studio was the perfect place to stay while I was in town for work.  It was so convenient get a coffee and snack right next door each day.
,,,,,,,,"We had a an excellent experience staying in Cody's studio.  The place was clean, had convenient parking, and everything you'd need for an extended stay.    The coffee shop across the lot was excellent and great to have near by.  "
,,,,,,,,"Cute studio, exactly as described. The coffee shop is great too. It was clean, comfortable  and Cody was easy to get ahold of. Nice that you can park a car there if needed. One note: the coffee shop does open early, and the sounds seem to carry a bit. I didn't mind at all, but a light sleeper might not enjoy it. Worth it for the proximity to Rainey Street and everything else. I'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Great Place. Would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"I was in town for a week attending a conference at the Austin Convention Center (ACC). Cody's place was about $100 less expensive than most hotel rooms, and just as convenient. It took me less than 10 minutes to talk to the ACC each morning, and was 5-15 minutes to countless restaurants and other places to go. (Also, it's right behind Cenote, which was a fantastic place for breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, or beer.)

Communication was fast and easy, apartment was very clean, and amenities were great."
,,,,,,,,"Definitely in a great place in respect to downtown. Cenote was also a great cafe, very yummy food."
,,,,,,,,This place was just as great as the other reviewers promised.  We were in Austin for Formula 1 and the proximity to the downtown shuttle and festivities at night was unbeatable.  The apartment was comfortable and had everything we needed. Cody was also prompt with communications. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Ideal location if you like to enjoy good food and entertainment in Austin. Everything is just a few blocks away, plus your in the backyard of the Cenote Cafe which has wonderful food and a great atmosphere."
,,,,,,,,"Place is huge, in a quiet area, and feels private. Perfect for a quick trip for 1-2 people."
,,,,,,,,Very pleasant. Cafe next door and location made the stay without encumbrances. 
,,,,,,,,Cody sent check in information well ahead of our stay which was nice. We were close to Rainey Street and 6th Stree but walking to Rainey required a bit of bravery - it was not pedestrian friendly at all. We loved the Cenote cafe and the bed is very comfortable. Having laundry was a nice bonus :)
,,,,,,,,"Cody's place is a gem in a great, and most charming part of Austin. Nice layout, notably well kept with all the essential amenities necessary for for feeling comfortable and ""at home"". A short 10 minute walk to the heart of downtown, one will come across a series of charming small bars and food venues where one can find the best BBQ (legit) in the city, several incredible brunch locales, and live music. All before reaching the heart Austin downtown. This place deserves merit not just for its nice interior but also because of its LOCATION! Great way to enjoy/experience Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Cody's place was absolutely perfect for our visit to Austin. Having lived there for four years recently, I wanted to spend our visit in a central but cozy location, and you really can't do better. His cafÃ©, Cenote, was always one of my favorite spots and the new juice bar there is great. All the best bars, book shops, BBQ and breakfast tacos are within walking distance, as is downtown - which was great as we were able to easily walk home after a show at Stubbs. The apartment was simple but clean and the staff at Cenote was helpful in stashing our bags safely until we could check in. Thanks Cody!"
,,,,,,,,Cenote is a hip place just outside of downtown proper. It's got a on-site coffee/juice bar and restaurant. The apt is comfortable and has a full kitchen.
,,,,,,,,"Cody was a great host, and access to the apartment was very simple.  The apartment is located behind Cenote Cafe (great burgers and coffee) in a funky part of town.  There is a designated parking spot for guest.  In addition to Cody, the Cafe manager and staff are always available to help with any questions or issues you may have.  The location of this apartment is awesome.  Easy access to downtown locations including the University.  We attended a football game, afterwards we walked downtown for dinner and then walked a few more blocks to the apartment. Had a blast!!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in Austin! The place was just as described - clean, spacious and close to downtown. Cenote cafe is so cute and the food is amazing! We would love to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"This studio is a hidden gem. The apartment itself is beautiful and updated. He keeps it equip with everything you might need while you're away from home. While in Austin, I did not have to rent a car, because we were able to walk to every location we planned on visiting. Being right next to Cenote was extremely convenient. We ate the majority of our meals at Cenote. Customer service and quality of food at this cafe is unmatched. I would come back to this place again and again."
,,,,,,,,"I loved this little apartment! It was the perfect place to rest my head after a long flight - the pillows are absolutely glorious! The space is great, the instructions Cody left me were spot on, and I felt very comfortable with the area. Thank you, Cody!

10/10 would recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,I needed a place to stay last minute for the night and this was Perfect for what I needed. Great location and great cafe next door. 
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved staying here and I would definitely stay here on my next trip to Austin! Cute trendy studio, amazing cafe and coffee at Cenote, short walk to Rainey Street, Congress & shops! Highly Recommend!! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay in the Cenote Studio! The Studio is located super close to East 6th, Rainey Street, downtown and 35. The space was clean and comfortable, and I would definitely consider staying here the next time I visit Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is conveniently located and really comfortable. It looks exactly as in the pictures. Cody was always responsive and a very good host. I'd stay in his place again, highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice, clean spot in a great location!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome super comfortable apartment in the best possible location
,,,,,,,,"Excellent place! The apartment was very nice, and exactly as pictured. The location can't be beat. It's only a short walk to Rainey Street, and only a bit further to South Congress and downtown. I highly recommend walking to the South Congress bridge at dusk to see the bats fly. The Airbnb is directly behind a great cafe called Cenote. We went there every morning for coffee and a snack. They were also nice enough to hold our bags at the cafe when we arrived before check-in, and also when we checked out prior to our flight leaving so we could have brunch in town without lugging our bags around. I highly recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was wonderful and in a great location! Would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at the Cenote Studio. The location on the up-and-coming East Side was perfect for walking access to downtown and South Congress, only a few blocks from the Town Lake running/walking/biking trail, and within short driving distance of anywhere else you might want to visit while in ATX.

The studio itself was extremely comfortable and well-maintained; it's right next door to the (amazing!) Cenote Cafe, which Cody also owns, so if you experience any issues (we did not) he's immediately available. I was traveling in a group of four, and Cody was considerate enough at booking to let me know that the second ""bed"" (a fold-out futon) was relatively small for two people. It ended up sleeping two people just fine.

I can't recommend this property highly enough and will definitely be back on my next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Clean and comfortable apartment - would recommend.
,,,,,,,,Accurate description. Great location. Recommended.
,,,,,,,,"Listing was totally accurate, very clean. In a great location and the Cenote cafe is awesome! Super easy check-in and check-out. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic stay at Cody's place at Cenote Cafe! The apartment was clean, super cute and functional. The location is great - close to downtown Austin, trendy spots in East Austin and shopping in South Congress. Plus, the cafe right downstairs is perfect for morning coffee or afternoon beers. Check in/out was easily done at the cafe. Very friendly staff at the cafe as well for any questions. Can't wait to come back!"
,,,,,,,,Cody's place is quite comfortable and thoughtfully put together. Great location and conveniently behind his coffee shop/restaurant. Cody was very responsive and I would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,We had an awesome stay! The room was just as described and we loved being able to walk over to Cenote for a breakfast taco in the morning. 
,,,,,,,,Cody was super chill and the place was perfect for what we needed. Love Cenote and make it a point to hang out there every time I'm in Austin so being so close was a big bonus. 
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect spot for our short trip in close proximity to everything we wanted to see and do. Great studio apartment,  extremely comfortable,  had everything you would need. Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"My Host was fabulous!! This place was so amazing that I don't even know where to begin. I was worried because it was closer to 9 pm when I arrived and I hate to be rude.... It couldn't have been a more accommodating situation!!! We had a designated parking space, and were greeted even though it was a later in the evening arrival time. The place was really cool/cute, clean, well equipped, and soooo quiet (black out drapes are always a plus). I can't rave enough about how convenient it was to have delicious coffee available for mornings... The food at the Cenote next door was out of this world. I tried every meal there more than once and all were amazing!! *Location location location!! +clean, cute, well equipped, and most importantly modern. Will recommend this place to everyone I know and would gladly stay here again if I'm fortunate enough to be accepted!!! xxx"
,,,,,,,,"Place was nice and clean.  Located within walking distance to many nice restaurants, bars, and attractions in Austin.  Location next to the Cenote cafe was very convenient for getting a good breakfast."
,,,,,,,,"Located literally walking distance from downtown, this studio was the perfect weekend getaway for my wife and I. The cafe was wonderful, and provides a great option for food when you feel like walking up late."
,,,,,,,,Excellent place in an excellent location. Everything as advertised. We walked to Rainy St and 6th St from Cody's place in a few minutes. 
,,,,,,,,"Cute and comfy studio apartment.  This was great for our short trip to Austin.  Comfortable bed, super clean and quiet. We loved being right next to the great cafe and coffee shop!  "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, comfortable, clean and within walking distance to everything. Cafe downstairs has yummy food. Would stay here again"
,,,,,,,,"Great stay at the Cenote Studio. Clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again. Also, recommend eating at Cenote- fun atmosphere, delicious food and drinks! "
,,,,,,,,This studio flat was very nice and getting in and out was very easy and convenient.  It was very clean and perfect for our quick stopover.  We would definitely stay here on future visits to Austin.  So convenient to downtown with its own coffee shop right on the property!
,,,,,,,,"We didn't get a chance to meet Cody, however, he was totally responsive and was easy to get a hold of! We ended up getting in very late Friday night, and he reached out to make sure we had arrived safely. 

In terms of the space-it was PERFECT! The pictures for this place are totally accurate-the space itself was exactly as described. It was very clean, very bright-an awesome place to crash for a few days. It had everything we needed. It is just steps away from downtown...everything you need is in walking distance. We only took a cab once the entire trip! The neighborhood was totally safe-we never had any concerns.

There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby, and the river walk is within walking distance, which was awesome. There are also plenty of spots to rent bikes, which we found to be an easy way to get around Austin. 

Also, the cafe (Cenote) that shares the property with this studio is incredible!! We ended up there almost everyday for breakfast. The food is reasonably priced, and is extremely fresh. It had a very chill atmosphere. Having the cafe so close-by was a huge bonus in addition to everything else.

Overall, we would 100% stay here again. This location cannot be beat!"
,,,,,,,,"as advertised, clean and comfortable. walking distance to downtown. great to have cenote cafe downstairs! could use a kettle/water boiler. "
,,,,,,,,"I knew this would be a good place to stay as I am familiar with the area, and it is exactly as described.  My comments, therefore, are eccentric and detail oriented, since others have already covered the general situation which is excellent.

Things I would have figured out how to use had I really wanted to were 1/ pilot light for gas stove -- it needs to be turned on if you want to use it (apparently most don't). There was an electric coffee pot and I decided that was enough. 2/ remote control for heat and a/c -- I am bad at remote controls, just turned off heat and was happy. But with a bit more effort on my part I would have had working gas stove and heat and a/c.

There is a huge television screen but no really good reading light. People who read at night might want a book light. I travel with a portable radio, as I am not a music-from-your-phone or a tv person, and I liked having this.

The couch is amazingly comfortable to sit on. That with the coffee table, and also the bar and chairs, are really wonderful work space. Especially the couch with the sunlight pouring through the window.

In general, as you know and can tell this is a great location and a great place. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,Exactly as described - great locale! 
,,,,,,,,Great place! Just as described. It had everything needed for a pleasant stay. The nearby Cenote cafe was excellent and convenient. I had the most amazing 10 days there. 
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay in Austin at the Cenote studio apartment. We didn't meet Cody but the staff at the cafe were very nice and helped us to check in. It's in a great location and easy to walk to many restaurants and cafes. It's also a very short cab/uber to the downtown area. The apartment itself was great. It was spotless, nice clean bathroom and sheets, and the bed was very comfortable. I would definitely recommend this AirBNB and would stay there again on another Austin trip. Thanks Cody!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome place! Loved the location and the bright airy feel of the studio apartment. Had all the amenities I needed plus more. My favorite part was staying behind Cenote and the juice bar where I could get fresh juice in the morning. Cory was very responsive and flexible when my plans changed a bit. Great experience!
,,,,,,,,"Cody was excellent at responding to question both before and after I booked.   He was very responsive when I had any questions during my stay.
The unit is well equipped, very comfortable and in a great location if you are going to the convention centre, as I was.  Having Cenote right next door was a godsend whether for an early caffeine hit, a bite to eat, or an excellent pint of IPA :) "
,,,,,,,,Great stay! Highly recommend this place to anyone!
,,,,,,,,"I did not ever meet Cody or see anyone other then the staff at Cenote.  Which by the way is an incredibly cafe - indeed delicious chai!
The apartment was clean and as shown in images (although different sofa and table, but same layout).  The instructions are clear on the refrigerator, and all was fine. "
,,,,,,,,"Came to Austin for the Formula 1 weekend and greatly enjoyed the apartment. Only walking distance to the downtown area and the JuJu Juice bar is a great spot for a drink and a feed. The apartment is a good size, is clean, Wifi works perfectly, as does the TV and air conditioning. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great studio in east Austin. Only a 10-15 minute walk to the main downtown district. Super clean! Check in process was easy and Cody was very responsive. Would definitely recommend this studio, especially if you are visiting Austin with a car as it has dedicated parking spot."
,,,,,,,,"I really liked the place. It is very different from anything I have stayed in Austin before. It is rustic modern. Location is great, Cenote coffee place is right next door and also is great - true BnB. Cody was very prompt and accommodating. Great experience. Thank you. "
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a great experience staying at Cody's place!  It was clean, convenient, and the neighborhood was great.  We had one minor issue, and Cody had it taken care of immediately - very responsive!  I would highly recommend renting from him."
,,,,,,,,"Cody was a wonderful host, we had a couple of requests which he sorted without any problem.  He generously allowed us a late check out for our daughter as she was leaving Austin late in the afternoon.  The apartment met the description perfectly.  Cenote was perfect for us, especially having the cafe in our back garden.  The cafe was wonderful with beautiful food and coffee and the staff were fantastic.  The location was perfect for us with a short walk to Rainey Street and to the downtown area. We recommend the apartment to other travellers.   Thanks Cody our stay in Austin was made so enjoyable by the space you provided for us.  Josie John and Chloe Robertson"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was great!  Our favorite part was the Cenote cafe. The food and service was amazing!  Fresh, great portions, and a cash discount - you cannot beat it.  We arrived, picked up the key and the nice staff showed us into the apartment.

The apartment has great charm and character.  Perfect for what we needed - a place to sleep and get ready to head back to the Convention Center which was a $5 Uber ride.  Our friends staying at hotels may have been able to walk to the Convention Center, but, they waited 45 minutes in line for Starbucks and we had amazing breakfast each morning by walking downstairs :)  

Thanks again Cody!"
,,,,,,,,"This little room above a garage is delightful.  I saw one comment say it was old...where it may be, this only makes it even more charming.  Great appointments in a very comfortable and peaceful space.  The best aspect is the fact you can roll out of bed in the morning...walk a few (URL HIDDEN) one of the most charming coffee house/restaurants in Austin (Cenote).  I'm not exaggerating, this coffee house and the grounds are beautiful and inviting.  As a writer who was just hanging in Austin to (URL HIDDEN) was a little slice of heaven."
,,,,,,,,"The cafe was busy when we arrived, and Cody was busy. He was pleasant but curt. We were not allowed to check in early, in fact had to ask twice when we came back to check in on time.
The area is great for accessibility to downtown Austin, and the food was excellent at Cenote Cafe.
The studio is old, VERY OLD. So if you prefer a spotless place, this may not work for you. We are not particularly picky, but this is not our best Airbnb experience.
Amenities are adequate, but a coffee pot and easily operable stove would have been appreciated. The A/C unit is a bit finicky."
,,,,,,,,Great studio and location near lots of awesome eating spots! Cody was super responsive to any messages. It was a bonus to have free parking and use of a washer dryer there also! Cenote served the best coffee I have had since being in the States!
,,,,,,,,"Great clean studio next to a chill cafe and minutes walk to Rainy St....this was a luck find. Can't go wrong with this place if you're looking a base for fun on the weekend or a place to work from during the week. Thank you, Cody, for making check-in super convenient and simple."
,,,,,,,,"We stayed here for two nights and could not be happier with the location!!! We love the fresh juice bar down stairs and Ibe the man that worked there was super friendly. Short drive to Barton springs, paddleboarding, and 6th street. Walking distance from east side which is full of chill bars and great food trucks. 
Check in was very easy- cody left notes in the apartment if we had any questions and his number was included if we needed to reach him. 
The place was the perfect size for two! Very clean, nice wood floors and he had fresh sheets and towels for us to use!
"
,,,,,,,,"The studio was great! Spacious and comfortable. Better than the description. Big bonus was that it was next to Cenote, which has fabulous breakfasts and good coffee. Easy to get to downtown. I will definitely stay again when I am in town."
,,,,,,,,We had a fabulous stay at the Cenote Studio. It was the hottest week on record in Austin and returning to the studio was always a welcome and comfortable escape from the heat. The location was convenient to great eats and offered easy access to downtown and nearby neighborhoods. Cody was a great host. He was very responsive before and during our stay. It was a great first visit to 'Bat City.'
,,,,,,,,"Great place, made for a good visit to Austin. Would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Cody's place was perfect for our needs. Clean, comfortable, central and hassle free. Loved popping down to the cafe for above average lattes and snacks in the morning while my husband caught a few extra zzz's. We'll be back and/or referring friends to this specific listing to be sure. "
,,,,,,,,The studio was exactly as described.  The restaurant was a perfect place to catch up on work and grab a meal or drink any time of the day.  The rental was close to everything or a short Uber away.  I would highly recommend staying in this up and coming neighborhood.
,,,,,,,,"Nice and clean space.  Everything planned out great and this was actually in a great location, walking distance to most of the hotspots in  town."
,,,,,,,,"The Cenote studio is great.  It's a low-key, easy check-in process because you get the key from the staff at the cafe adjacent to the studio.  So I just showed up instead of having to coordinate with someone to meet me there (as is usually the case with airbnb spaces.  

These aren't upscale digs--if that's what you're looking for, there are some fine hotels downtown.  However, this place is very comfortable, clean, and quite spacious for a studio--it's an old space that's been refreshed, so there's a blend of old and new.  The bath and kitchen are vintage, but the HVAC, TV, lighting, etc. are new.  

Cody communicated well beforehand, and I met him at one point while I was in the cafe for coffee.  The cafe, by the way, is awesome--great coffee and great breakfasts.  Looks like they have a really good beer/cider/wine selection and their lunches and dinners are probably really good, too, but I only hung out there in the mornings for coffee and breakfast. 

I'd definitely stay there again if I were heading to Austin, and I recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay. The location is perfect as is the parking there. Close to the excitement of downtown, but easy to escape to calmer environs. Easy walking distance to kayaking and Congress street bats. Breakfast burritos are awesome at Cenote, juice and smoothies super fresh and tasty at Juju. Plenty of options around for anything to keep anyone busy. Plenty of peace and quiet to relax. Thanks for putting us up and putting up with us. "":^)"
,,,,,,,,"This Austin studio was perfect for our trip to Austin!
My boyfriend and I arrived pretty late, and Cody had left the apartment open so we didn't have to worry about checking in, etc. The apartment itself was just as described, very stylishly furnished and cozy but spacious enough for what we needed. Excellently located- it was a short, cheap Uber ride out to South Congress, and we were an easy walk to the Eastside section of 6th street, and downtown. The Cenote cafe was adorable and delicious, and we spent a pretty good amount of time there as well. Highly recommend this spot!"
,,,,,,,,"We were so happy with our stay! The location was perfect for exploring the city. East Austin is such a neat area with so many great food and beer options, very walkable, or a quick B-Cycle ride to anywhere in the city. The check-in and check-out were effortless, and the studio was a wonderful place to come home to."
,,,,,,,,Cody was very accommodating on our recent trip to Austin. The photos in the description accurately reflect the look and feel of the studio. Austin is a fun city and I definitely look forward to staying here again soon.
,,,,,,,,It was exactly like the description and the bed was very comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,My stay at the Cenote Studio was great!  I was in Austin for a conference and staying at the Cenote Studio made it way more affordable and pleasurable than if I had stayed at one of the convention center hotels.  I loved this part of Austin.  Cody and the rest of the staff at the Cenote made me feel very welcome.  The studio itself was really cozy and had everything I needed.  Coffee every morning at the Cenote was a great way to start the day.  As a woman traveling by herself I really couldn't have asked for a better place to call my temporary home.
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location just a short walk from all the good bars on 6th east. Cody and the whole team at Cenote are very welcoming. The flat is spacious clean and very comfortable, we slept four there with ease. Also worth mentioning the Cenote cafe and juice bar is great for healthy food and good coffee! 10/10 all round experience! "
,,,,,,,,"Cenote studio was a great AirBnB for me and my girlfriend (bay area natives). We loved the proximity to downtown, the lake, and B-cycle. Everything was clean and the air-conditioning was in good working order, which proved crucial on some hot days during our visit in early May. Had no problem getting several good nights of sleep and really appreciated access to the washer and dryer. Lastly, we loved being able to wake up and eat breakfast at the Cenote cafe as well as Ju-Ju-Juice (counter and kitchen are attached to the cafe). Good vibes for a morning drink of tea/coffee and a book."
,,,,,,,,Great location and easy check-in.
,,,,,,,,"This studio was perfect for what my husband I were looking for in Austin- good walkability and cool, clean,  and comfortable place to spend our down time. We loved the proximity to Cenote Cafe (great food and coffee) as well as Rainey Street, food trucks, and the path around the river which we biked, ran, and rented kayaks on. We didn't bring a car with us, and it was an easy walk, bike ride (B Cycle), or inexpensive Uber ride to anywhere in Austin. I would definitely recommend this and look forward to coming back to stay again."
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 338 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,We had a very nice stay at the Cenote Studio on our visit to Austin.  Cody was very easy to work with and timely in his communications.  The studio was very clean and comfortable and the description was very accurate.  The bed was fantastic.  A real bonus was the Cenote Cafe as we ate breakfast there every morning and also enjoyed sitting out one evening.  It was a 15 minute walk to the heart of the city and we did that everyday.  Would stay again.
,,,,,,,,"Very nice and cozy! On our second night we had a girls' night in, and the modern tv and heater were great while we snuggled on the couch and watched a movie. The Cenote cafe is lovely, and Cody was always quick to respond to questions. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"The studio was as charming as the pictures and well-appointed to boot. We had everything we needed, except coffee (and Cenote was a short walk away). I was there for a conference at the convention center, which is just a short walk down Cesar Chavez. 

I never met Cody, but the staff at Cenote helped me check in and out and there were helpful notes once I got into the apartment.

I would love to stay here again if I have the pleasure of returning to Austin. What a great space!"
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment near the Austin Convention Center with available parking and directly behind a tasty restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The cost of my stay was a fraction of what I would have paid at a hotel. Checking in and out was a breeze, the apartment was comfortable, and I would definitely book again."
,,,,,,,,"The Cenote Studio is situated right in the middle of the action in East Austin, and is a snug and comfortable rental. We loved the location; the bed was quite comfortable, and the bathroom roomy. Great home base for exploring all of Austin. The proximity to the coffee shop was also great -- the pickled vegetables were a favorite! "
,,,,,,,,We arrived late (midnight) and Cody was very accommodating.  The location of Cenote is ideal (within walking distance to many Austin attractions including easy freeway access).  The pictures of the apartment are accurate and the accommodations were comfortable for our 4 night stay.
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 54 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Checking in was easy and the location is great. In particular, it's right above a great restaurant and includes a parking spot, both of which are very handy. The place was comfortable and clean and well-stocked. We had a great time."
,,,,,,,,"The location of the Cenote Studio was perfect! Walking distance to lots of fun bars in East Austin and downtown. I also loved Cenote Cafe and ate breakfast there all week (and the JuJu Juice bar!) Cody was very communicative and answered all of my texts. Also I accidentally locked myself out and the people in the cafe were super nice and found an extra set of keys. The studio had all of the basics but a bit rough around the edges.. the shower only went about lukewarm, towels had stains, and the entranceway light wasn't working."
,,,,,,,,"Oh, this place was just perfect. Gorgeous, comfortable, walking distance to Rainey St restaurants, downtown and more. Proximity to excellent Cenote coffee = added bonus. Cody was also there for whatever I needed and super communicative. I'm in Austin often and I can't wait to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was very clean and well-maintained. Right behind the Cenote Cafe, it was convenient to grab some breakfast there and a very short walk to Rainey St. "
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I stayed here for a girls weekend in October and loved it! Upon arrival we were welcomed with instructions and contact numbers if we needed anything. It was very easy to check in and out and everything was clean upon entry.

The location of this apartment couldn't be more perfect. You are steps from the Cenote cafe which has the most amazing coffee. I am still craving the homemade vanilla bean that was mixed into my coffee each morning. The city is not more than a 20-25 minute walk away for a quick 5 minute drive. You are also a 5 minute walk from the food trucks which was awesome.

A few things to note that we did have minor issues with were:

1. We couldn't figure out how the air conditioning worked. We read the instructions but it kept kicking on and off at weird times. Needless to say there were points we were freezing and others we were very hot. 
2. Some of the towels were washed but were stained from previous users. Not a big deal as we just grabbed new ones from the closet.
3. The wifi stopped working on day 2. Not sure what happened. Again not a huge deal as we weren't really ever in the apartment so we didn't feel that it was a big enough issue to reach out to Cody.

Overall we loved this place and would stay here again in a heartbeat. Cody was a great host as he allowed us to have an early check in which was very helpful. I would recommend this place to everyone.

Thank you again Cody!  "
,,,,,,,,"Such a nice place!  It's a nice little home perfect for a couple, clean and cosy.  Near from everything (we enjoyed particularly the Rainey street and the 6th E for cool bars and friendly eating places) and the Cenote cafe just in front for the late breakfast.  The staff is really sympathique.  Cody accommodated us cause our flight was delayed and he always look like an easygoing guy.  We will recommended this place for sure and come back for another ACL festival!  Austin is the perfect city for music lovers!"
,,,,,,,,Really enjoyable stay at Cody's place. The bed is unbelievably comfortable! Good shower pressure and the air con was a treat from the heat outside. Within walking distance to Rainey Street and 6th Street. Personally I preferred Rainey St and East 6th had a much better atmosphere than west 6th - less young college kids and better music. Staff at Cenote were very friendly and helpful and Cody was quick to let me know the wifi details had changed. Would definitely return!
,,,,,,,,Nice clean property. East to check in and check out. Fantastic location. Will use again without hesitation.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at Cody's place. It was big, spacious, and in walking distance to everywhere we wanted to go out at night. He was also very responsive: we went swimming one day and needed additional towels, and they brought them over right away. An awesome place to stay and would come back again. Recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a great time staying at Cenote Studio earlier this month. I was in town exhibiting at the Austin Home and Garden show at the convention center, and booked the apartment because it was within walking distance of the show. 
Cody was a very attentive host, answering any questions I had with a quick text or in person at the Cenote Cafe next door.  The cafe has really good coffee and sandwiches, so if you stay at the studio, you don't have to go far to eat.  I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at the Cenote Studio. It had lots of space, a kitchen and a lovely bathroom. The apartment was as per the photos and was very clean. The air con was great in the heat and the location was wonderful. Could walk to the river, Soco and 6th street. Having the cafe downstairs was also great - tasty food and good coffee! Can't fault the place. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was great. Clean comfy and next to a delicious coffee shop and juice bar. Great access to all the cool stuff Austin has to offer. Bike trails are close, bars, restaurants and more.  Thanks. "
,,,,,,,,"We've stayed here before and decided to stay again because Cody's place is clean, comfortable, and perfectly located. It continues to be that way and I'm sure we'll be back! "
,,,,,,,,Cody's place is awesome. Terrific location and Cenote seems to be the happening cafe in town. I would definitely stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"We loved the Cenote Studio! Cody was super accessible during our stay and was a helpful, attentive host. The studio itself was clean and comfortable with much more character and light than a hotel room. We also liked the neighborhood quite a bit. In addition to having Cenote right outside, we were only a 10 minute walk to friends staying at the Hilton downtown and less than 10 to Rainey Street. "
,,,,,,,,"Cody's place was great. Clean, good AC, next to a nice cafe, walking distance from downtown, bus stop, or Austin B-cycle rental station. We had a great stay and would recommend this place to friends. Cody was very nice and accomodating."
,,,,,,,,"My sister and I stayed here over Fourth of July weekend and LOVED it! Super cute space, very clean, loved that it was right behind the cafe (they have a fabulous iced chai latte, btw), and short walking distance to Rainey street (which you'll be thankful for after a late night...). A short/cheap Uber cab ride to downtown and anywhere else you want to go, too.

I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in town! Thanks a bunch, guys!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a wonderful stay! Austin was fantastic, as was Cody and the apartment. I can't say enough good things! I definitely recommend stating here and will again when I'm back in town!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a wonderdul place to stay. Clean and comfortable, Cody had everything set up, and ready to go. Staying in the 'backyard' of one of Austin's best places to drink coffee or beer, while eating breakfast tacos or delicous sandwiches made the experience that much more amazing. I would stay here again for sure. "
,,,,,,,,This is a great spot in Austin. Very close to 6th and Rainey street and a good walking area. Also right next door to the Cenoto cafe which is extremely convenient and has great food and drinks. Very pleasant!
,,,,,,,,"It was a pleasure staying at the Cenote Studio for our short stay in Austin. We loved this place and its location - only short walk to downtown (6th Street etc) and even shorter 5 min walk to Rainey Street (which we loved)!! We loved that the apartment was beside the Cenote Cafe, great spot for breakfast, lunch, evening drink and the Ju Ju Juice bar was great too. Very laid back place. Check in and out was also very easy and laid back - just how we like it. We would definitely recommend and stay here again. Thanks again :) "
,,,,,,,,This is a perfect location.  It's awesome to have Cenote right there also.  
,,,,,,,,We had a good stay at Cody's place! It was all about the location!
,,,,,,,,"The place was perfectly comfortable and in a super great location. It's a 5-10 minute walk to all of the downtown attractions we wanted to see, which was ideal! Also, the cafe next door is really charming and has delicious food and coffee. The host is very accommodating and responds quickly to any messages. I would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,Great studio. Just what I needed. Comfortable and clean. Great to have the cafe right there. Quiet at night. Cody made it easy.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean and comfortable.  Staying right there at Cenote CafÃ© makes for a very cool ""home base.""  Great location!"
,,,,,,,,"Me and 3 friends stayed at Cody's place during a conference in Austin. It was cozy and comfortable. We loved the location, the ease of getting in and out, the style and accessibility. Cody was communicative and accommodating. I also loved that it was located behind a fantastic gastropub/cafe that served great food, delicious beer and brewed Handsome coffee. If I'm ever back in Austin, I will definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice light, friendly host, only thing I missed was a coffee maker. "
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience staying at Cody's loft.  The Cenote coffeshop in front of the studio is a great place to start your day and the avocado burrito was delicious.  Checking in and out could not have been easier and Cody was great getting everything set up on short notice.  I would definitely stay here again when I come back to Austin as it met all of my expectations and Cody was a very accommodating host.  
,,,,,,,,perfect place to hide away!  amazing location.. great cafe next door with some of the best food and coffee
,,,,,,,,"The place was great, the location right and the coffee shop highly recommended 
 Defiantly will return "
,,,,,,,,We had a perfect stay in the Cenote studio.  Cody helped to make the experience easy by responding extremely fast to all emails and making a very easy pick up/ drop off location for the keys.  The studio was in a great location- easy to walk everywhere and we loved having breakfast every morning at cenote.  I would definitely recommend the cenote studio to future travelers!
,,,,,,,,Wonderful space in a great location. We started off every morning with breakfast at the Cenote Cafe and then headed out to explore the city by foot. We were there 8 nights and never regretted not renting a car because you can walk to everything. Used the kitchen for a few light meals to save money. Being able to do laundry was also a plus. We ended our evenings with a craft beer at the cafe. Perfect vacation.
,,,,,,,,"We had amazing stay! The apartment is the perfect size, nice big bathroom, huge tv and probably the most comfortable bed and bedding I've ever had away from home. Cody was super kind and helpful and any question we had he answered by text right away. We happened to stay the one weekend it snowed in austin and Cody was quick to bring us extra blankets and an extra heater. 

The cafe right downstairs was the best. We had breakfast there every day the week we were there. Awesome food and great staff. 

We would stay here again in a heartbeat and would recommend it to anybody! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, right next to all of the cool stuff that's downtown! Perfect, cozy size for just two. Has all of the amenities that you could want, even for those nights that you just want to relax and stay in."
,,,,,,,,"My parents stayed in the Cenote studio for several days while visiting me. They loved the great location of the studio, and Cody was an excellent communicator before and during the stay. My parents mentioned how loud street noise and neighbor noise was, which is definitely typical of the neighborhood. Cenote is a great cafe, and they loved being right next door to great coffee and food. "
,,,,,,,,"The studio was great. It's exactly as pictured and very comfortable. Plus, everything you'll want to do or see is either within walking distance or a short drive."
,,,,,,,,"This place is a real gem. Clean, comfortable, and in a great location, next to Cenote. I'll definitely be looking to stay here again next time I'm in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Cody was a great host, accepting the reservation at a short notice and being very accommodating with the sleeping arrangements. The flat is spacious and clean and is situated perfectly to explore Austin. Thank you for having us over!"
,,,,,,,,"The studio is lovely. A great location and the cafe below does a tasty bite + coffee too. 

The AirBnB machine made a hash of our booking and Cody was super helpful about sorting it all out. "
,,,,,,,,Stayed in this property for 2 nights while watching the Grand Prix and it was excellent. The apartment is very comfortable and clean and it was only a 10/15 minute walk to downtown. The Cenote Bar next to the apartment is a nice place to have a drink and something to eat.
,,,,,,,,"I really like the place.  Great location, close to downtown and easily walkable.  Adjacent to a fantastic cafe (the coffee was very good).  The room was a good space, clean and smart.  A very positive experience."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and coffee. Would definitely come back, and recommend this place to friends passing through town."
,,,,,,,,"Cody's studio was perfect for me - clean, comfortable, quiet and close to everything. Downtown is withing easy walking distance,  there are plenty of bars/restaurants nearby, and Cenote cafe is top-notch!

Although I didn't get to meet Cody, he was friendly, helpful and made everything super-easy."
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay at the Cenote Studio. Cody was quick and responsive with any questions we had and accommodated us a few hours before check in. The studio is located in a fun neighborhood right behind the Cenote coffee shop, we stopped in several times for drinks and treats. You MUST go there if you stay at the studio, can you say 3 dollar mimosa? Yes, you can. The studio is walking and driving distance to downtown, Congress Street, Whole Foods, Alamo Drafthouse and more. 

The studio was open, had great light, open spaces, DirectTV, strong WiFi, a super comfortable bed and pull out couch bed. This owner understands the important of good pillows and linens! The kitchenette was perfect for our needs, though could have used a few gadgets (wine opener!). 

We would HIGHLY recommend staying at the Cenote Studio! Thanks Cody and ATX for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Cenote is a great place in the best part of Austin as it is closed to everything including the best bars/restaurants/publs/clubs in town.
We love to have that studio which is neat and comfy, just a few steps from the Cenote cafÃ© where the beers and Mocha are just fantastic.
"
,,,,,,,,"Cody, Cenote, and Austin were the best. Location is perfect. "
,,,,,,,,"My daughter & I stayed at Cody's place at the end of September.  It was clean and convenient.  It is located right behind their awesome cafe, Cenote.  Cenote had a great vibe & many great choices for food, beverages & fun.  We would definitely stay here again.  Thanks for the great visit."
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed the Cenote Studio. Pictures and description were accurate. The location is great for walking to many places - 6th st. and other restaurants and the neighborhood is interesting. My favorite meal of the trip was from the food trucks nearby. We really enjoyed breakfast at the Cenote Cafe. I would stay there again!  Thanks for everything!  
,,,,,,,,"Cenote Studio is just a few blocks from downtown and near many East Austin destinations.  It was nice just being a few steps away from Cenote Cafe which has a really nice outdoor atmosphere  (as long as it is not hotter than hell).  The inside was newly remodeled, it was cool inside and it definitely was not outside.  The apartment was stocked with plenty of clean linens and towels.  My only deduction is for overall cleanliness-the floors and countertops were not as clean as I like."
,,,,,,,,"This was exact what we were looking for! Terrific location - we were walking distance to most of the things we wanted to be walking distance to and we had no trouble parking when we did have to drive. 

It had been really nicely updated inside and the bed was very comfortable. 

I do wish that there was another towel rack in the bathroom as well as a place to put my toiletries. 

I would definitely stay here again!"
11184708,5,10,10,10,9,10,9,Spent the weekend in Austin with friends for a birthday. Really enjoyed the house. Very clean and very cute!
,,,,,,,,"Quaint house and quiet neighborhood located just West of downtown Austin.  Walkable distance to the action, but the streets are quite dark at night."
,,,,,,,,Fantastic property at a fair price. I greatly enjoyed my stay and TK was a great host!
,,,,,,,,My wife and in-laws stayed here for a weekend and we had a great time. TK's house is in a great location and was very enjoyable. 
,,,,,,,,Great house in a prime location.  Check in was easy and the house was clean and well stocked with everything 6 people would need for a weekend stay.  Very clean! Would stay there again in a heartbeat!
,,,,,,,,"TK's house was an excellent home away from home for my friends and I over Presidents' Day weekend. The location was fantastic and all amenities were available. The house was in immaculate shape, simple and clear instructions were provided, and they were very accessible in the event we needed them. I would highly recommend their property and would gladly stay there again. Very reasonable rate for how close to everything the house was. "
5251657,5,9,10,10,9,10,9,We were 13 of us for bachelor party!!! We had great time at the place. Its in downtown Austin and really close to 6th streets bars! Only about 5 minute walking distance. Recommend to anyone who wants to have a good time in downtown Austin!! Place also has a rooftop with great view of the city! Nice to just hang out and have some drinks outside in the sun. Will definitely stay there again..
,,,,,,,,"Great stay. We came as a Bachelor party for ten, perfect for our use as a base to explore the city. ample room with beds for all. There is no cable but an Apple TV to utilize with great speakers, easy to sync to. nice gesture with welcome present. "
,,,,,,,,We stayed here for a bachelor party and had a terrific time. This place is great for a big group and the location is fantastic. Can't recommend it enough. 
,,,,,,,,This place is perfect for a bachelor party. Sick spot. 5 minute walk to rainey st or 6th st. Its big enough to fit all your friends. Its clean. Sound system to blast music. Cement floors so its easy to clean up spills. We were contemplating on getting a hotel but this is 100% the way to do it. I highly recommend this place. 
,,,,,,,,"We were here for a bachelorette party and we couldn't have asked for a better experience in terms of location, amenities, and the overall space. The rooftop patio was our go-to hangout spot at night before we went out, and the next morning when we just wanted to nap. We were walking distance from East and Dirty 6th, and our hosts recommended TONS of places to try, all without needing a cab. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Very accurate listing. Great house
Up and coming neighborhood. 
Central to everything"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here with 7 friends for my bachelor party and cannot say enough great things about the place. When we arrived, Clint was there to welcome us, give us a rundown of the apartment, and some awesome suggestions for local nightlife. Location is absolutely perfect - it is a quick 2-3 minute walk from Dirty 6th, and very easily accessible to West 6th and Rainey Streets. The apartment was clean, slept 8 comfortably, and was just as it appeared in pictures. Overall we had a blast, and I cannot recommend this location enough."
,,,,,,,,"The trip couldn't have gone much smoother. Bachelor party with 12 guys. Host kept in pretty constant contact via text messages before and during trip when we needed him. Host met us upon arrival immediately; had fridge stocked with many beers for our party which was amazing. The house was extremely clean and organized. Blue tooth speakers, large TV, all the amenities you would need for a bachelor party. It really is ideal for a group of guys for a bachelor party. That being said, the immediate surrounding area is a bit rough. Didn't matter to me and my crew because we come from areas where we see a lot of homeless crackheads...but would not recommend to families traveling with women or children. DEFINITELY has to be one of the best rentals for a bachelor party though. Host also supplied tons of clean towels, beds all came made with sheets, pillows and (URL HIDDEN) no worries there either.  You are literally half a mile away from the big restaurant and bar scene on 6th street. There is also a liquor store, gas station, and Wendy's right across the street...ultra convenient there. Overall I would give this Host a 9 out of 10! "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great apartment/location. I work in the Corp. Furnished Apt. industry and I was very impressed with Devlin and his team. Very responsive (via text) and everything was straight forward and easy. I was in town for a bachelor party (9 of us) and the space fit us perfectly. In addition the location was amazing convenience to everything (Live music/Dirty-6/Convenience/food store.  Highly recommend, enjoy. "
,,,,,,,,"Stayed here for my brother's bachelor party. Even before I officially booked the stay I was provided we prompt responses to my inquires. Furthermore, many of us had not been to Austin before and we expressed that. We were immediately provided with information on what to do and where to eat. They were beyond helpful and I highly recommend booking this location if you have a large group. "
,,,,,,,,Fridge was stocked with drinks and Clint came to meet us and give us a great explanation of everything the city has to offer.  They were all great!
,,,,,,,,Great place. Prime location in the city. Hosts were very easy to deal with and were available to help in any way possible. 
,,,,,,,,"This is easily the best spot in town for groups wanting to experience all that Austin has to offer.  Prime location, amazing rooftop, super nice townhouse, and the best hosts.  The Inn Cahoots team went above and beyond to make sure our stay was memorable and comfortable.  Looking forward to the next trip!"
,,,,,,,,Great host and a great house for our bachelor party.
,,,,,,,,"This house was beyond perfect for a bachelorette party. The house was clean and it has tons of sleeping space, a great hang out area, and awesome roof and it is steps away from all the bars on 6th street. Devlin and his team made us feel so welcome and made sure all our questions were answered within minutes. I would definitely recommend this listing for a trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome. The team here was very welcoming, provided free drinks to kick off our weekend, and met up with us to give us some local tips and suggestions on where hang out and also eat. We had 14 of us, and the townhome fit us comfortably. We will be back, hopefully sooner rather than later."
,,,,,,,,"The team was very helpful in introducing our group to the apartment as well as Austin in general. Check in/out went very smoothly. The apartment was great, and easily accommodated our group of 10 people."
,,,,,,,,This place worked out great for our large group. The location is perfect. Close to everything. The were plenty of beds for us. The roof deck is awesome. Devlin and Clint helped us out and took care of everything we needed. All around great trip. 
,,,,,,,,"Great house at a great location. Tons of sleeping space, nice kitchen and an awesome rooftop!"
,,,,,,,,"Devlin, Clint and the entire team helped make our bachelor party weekend great. Would highly recommend this property to anyone with a large group! "
,,,,,,,,This was the perfect lodging for my 14 person bachelor party.  The living room and rooftop were perfect for hanging out and the apartment slept all of us comfortably.  Devlin offered to help our party in anyway possible even beyond just general apartment proceedings.  The location was perfect as it was walking distance to dozens of bars in almost every direction.  I would highly recommended staying here for any and all large groups
,,,,,,,,"Came here with a large group for a bachelor party. The place was as impressive as described on this listing and in the photos. It was exactly what we were looking for. Plenty of sleeping room, awesome roof deck, and walking distance from Rainey / any 6th street bars. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"The location of this place is amazing.  Close walking distance to shops, great food, great bars and everything you should see while in Austin.  The hosts went above and beyond in setting the place up and helping out with great places to see and things to do while in Austin.  The place itself was perfectly suited for our bachelor party of 14!  I cannot say enough about this location and the hosts.  We will come back someday."
,,,,,,,,The house was perfect for our bachelor party of 11. The house came fully stocked with everyone we could ask for and more (including local beer and liquor upon arrival!). Highly recommend to any large groups coming to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Devlin and Clint made us feel right at home. We came here for a bachelor party with a big group, and the venue was perfect. The house was a great home-base while we were in Austin. The space was perfect for a large group of people, and was in a convenient location to access all the best parts of Austin (East 6th, Rainey Street, Dirty 6th and more). I would highly recommend for large groups. We loved the roof deck. All of the recommendations for bars and restaurants were spot-on as well. "
,,,,,,,,The house was very well appointed as it was when our group arrived.  What little we did request form Devlin he provided right away.  Excellent manager.  Had a great time
,,,,,,,,Awesome. This townhouse was the perfect location for our trip. Everything was walkable and easily accessible.  Plenty of room for our group of ten. Devlin and his team were very helpful. Would definitely recommend this listing.
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for our bachelor party. Plenty of space and great roof deck. Just an FYI, they do not have cable TV."
,,,,,,,,Great house for a group of 12. Extremely accommodating. Rooftop patio is definitely the jewel of the place. Panoramic views of downtown Austin skyline. Prime location. Short walk to 6th street or easy cab ride to anywhere you might need to go. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay here for ACL. The location was spot on right where we wanted to be to catch some low key nightlife after each day. The house fits large groups extremely comfortably and the view from the bedroom and rooftop is gorgeous. 

The hosts made us feel super welcome by leaving us with a plentiful stocking of local brews and great tips as to where we could find good food and bars (although it's Austin, can you really miss that hard?)."
,,,,,,,,"Devlin was a great host.  He contacted me prior to arrival and provided great information about the house and surrounding area.  The location of the apartment is very convenient to downtown, local bars, and great food.  The townhouse itself was very cool, a modern design, a solid layout, and great views and outdoor space.  Recommended for anyone looking to book a large group.  "
,,,,,,,,"* Host was very responsive via email / sms and showed up in person to give advice etc. 
* Apartment is in a great location, as advertized. 
* There's a place to park. 
* Apartment was comfortably laid out
"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great stay. The host was very helpful, organized, and responsive. The spot was clean, had some beer in the fridge, and exactly what we thought it would be. I would highly reccomend this spot. Thank you for a greaty stay/"
,,,,,,,,"Devlin was a great host. The house was in great condition and everything was fantastic, as advertised. In addition, Devlin suggested things to do during our stay. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at the townhouse. Clint met us and let us in early as he finished the preparations, gave us plenty of good local recommendations. They even supplied us with some local brews! There was plenty of space for our party of 13 and the layout was just right for our group. "
,,,,,,,,"Devlin and his crew made us all feel incredibly welcome. The house was in the perfect location - walking distance to all the bars and restaurants. Before our arrival, he made sure that all of my questions were answered. When I called, his crew answered. When I had questions about the cooking utensils, they were at the house in less than 30-minutes to get us what we needed.

I couldn't have asked for a better weekend, a more perfect house for a bachelorette party and a better crew to make us feel ""at home""."
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely amazing house, location and hosts!  Incredible place to stay with great furniture (including on the rooftop patio!), very clean, and great (huge) bedding for the entire group.  The hosts were very accommodating in helping us make dinner reservations, navigate Austin itself, and even provided a laundry list of fun activities for us to do while in town.  The place is just a few minute walk from busy downtown streets with restaurants/bars, with an incredible view of the city from the living room/roof.

Would love to stay here again, was an amazing place and experience for a big group!"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 63 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Easy to check into the place and was provided some local beer.
,,,,,,,,"Location is incredible. Walking distance to Dirty 6th, West 6th, and Rainey St. strips. More good food/drinks/general entertainment than you can consume in weeks, all within footsteps. Great space for large groups. Make sure to complete a full walkthrough with your point of contact prior to checking in to ensure that all appliances are functional."
,,,,,,,,"Great place in a great location. Host was lovely and everything was exactly as described. Would 100% stay there again.
"
,,,,,,,,"Jessica was really nice.  She arrived on time and quickly showed me around and made sure I didn't have any questions.  The place itself was great.  Very clean, plenty of space, everything worked really well, including Sonos sound system and wifi.   Great location that makes walking to almost everything very easy.  Only downside is that Sonos speakers didn't work from the roofdeck.  "
,,,,,,,,"Jessica was a great host!  She was waiting at the property for us and quickly went through the whole house with us.  When she realized we needed a few things, she went out and got them for us, as well as a few welcome gifts.  The house is in an amazing location for walking to anything you could want.  Would definitely recommend."
700855,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,We rented Alexander's home during SXSW 2016. He was very kind and welcoming. The house was clean and in a calm and nice neighborhood. Thank you Alexander and maybe see you next year ;)
,,,,,,,,"After checking into another AirBnB listing that turned out to be unsatisfactory, I booked Alexander's home. He was able to accommodate me and my friends last minute during the week of SXSW. The house was neat, clean and looked just like the pictures. The neighborhood has lots of character and just a short bike ride to pretty much everything you could want as well as close to the convention center.

Thank you for hosting us, Alexander. I would definitely recommend your home to others looking to stay in a fun, yet quiet part of town."
,,,,,,,,"The house was charming and comfortable. We had a spectacular time. 

Such gracious hosts, thank you for having us. "
,,,,,,,,"Alex was awesome. Prompt, very communicative and responsive. The place was clean, well appointed and in a nice neighborhood. It wasn't exactly walking distance to downtown - about 2 miles away. But Alex let me borrow his bike - which was great. Would definitely stay there again."
8427091,5,10,10,9,10,10,9,Great service and welcoming environment 
,,,,,,,,"Great location right across from the convention center.  Raul was a great host and room was great.  As others have said, there is a bit of crowd noise outside but didn't bother me.  Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience.  Raul was friendly and responsive, and really kept to his own bedroom other than that (is this the life of an airbnb host?).  Very prompt in letting me know of door code changes, and location really can't be beat if you're in town for an event at the convention center.  

The king size bed does take up virtually the entire room, as others mentioned, but wasn't a problem for me.  Other things to note that may have been mentioned but good to note (and absolutely not a reflection on Raul or rating):  The apartment is on the second floor, with the bedrooms being directly above an entry/exit gate made of solid iron.  This means, if you're a light sleeper like I am, that gate is going to wake you virtually every time someone comes in or goes out.  

I think I was relatively lucky in that there were no more than two others staying in the place while I was there, but I could see the one bathroom being a serious challenge with more than that - and it was a bit uncomfortable my last day.  Common courtesy should dictate friendly communication that you're about to embark on back-to-back 45 minute bathroom endeavors to let those that might need to empty their bladders to do so.  :-/"
,,,,,,,,Great location downtown. Easy access to mass transit. Starbucks across street. Enjoyed chatting with Raul. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Location is perfect. Great food and drinks in every direction.

Room is just fine for 1-2 people that are looking to experience Austin.'

Only issue I had is the street noise (loud cars, bikes, people). Not a huge issue if you're there to have fun!"
,,,,,,,,"My first time using Airbnb and it was great! 
Communication with Raul was excellent. His directions to his condo were perfect & detailed. I shared a bathroom with other guests and that went just fine - never saw them and they were clean/neat. Location was perfect & I felt safe. Clean room, nice bedding & towels provided. I love the guest book in his entry way as well as maps/brochures of the area. I would recommend! "
,,,,,,,,Raul was really good on communication! If you was in town for a convention it right across the street and its really convenient. You also have 6th Street which is two blocks above you and that's great too!
,,,,,,,,Zac and Raul were very responsive to any questions I had leading up to and during my stay.  The room was exactly what I expected from their advertisement and the bathroom was clean and easily accessed.  This unit has two rooms that can be rented through airbnb and I had no issue with noise or space usage with regard to the other customers.  I was attending a conference at the Austin Convention center and the location could not have been better.  I hope to stay with Zac and Raul again next year for the same conference.
,,,,,,,,"I never got to meet Zac; however Raul was great and took care of all of my needs, some of which are admittedly odd! As I was attending several days' worth of events at the Convention Center, the location couldn't be more perfect! It literally took me 30 seconds to walk down the stairs, out the gate, across the street, and through the convention center doors right into our main event space. VERY cool! My only surprise (and only slight annoyance) was discovering that the pool is not in the building, but rather in the identical building on the next block. Other than that, everything was aces!"
,,,,,,,,The room was correct. The bathroom is shared with other room and this is not stated clearly in the add. 
,,,,,,,,"Raul and Zac's place was as I expected: It is clean, conveniently located, and had everything the listing described. My only disappointment was that I never met the host. Raul did respond quickly to my messages and made sure I had no problem getting into his place.

The location is very convenient it you are attending an event at the convention center or at any of the downtown hotels. 

I would stay again if I were travelling to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great stay in Austin! Super convenient location for a conference at the Marriott. Quiet, clean apartment and easy to come and go.  Raul was very nice and extremely responsive. So easy to take the bus to and from the airport. "
,,,,,,,,Great location!!!! Confortable flat and room! The host sent us a message with all the information. Everything was fantastic!
,,,,,,,,I had a very positive experience staying at Raul and Zac's! The location was central and safe. The room was clean and the bed was spacious. Street noise at night was minimal and the directions to the apartment were clear. I recommend this spot 100%. 
,,,,,,,,"My only warning: because this is at a busy corner, and the building isn't substantially soundproof, it will probably be difficult if you're a light sleeper. But, that's not Raul and Zac's fault, and the parts they were responsible for (cleanliness, ease of getting in/out, etc.) were good. Didn't interact with them much, but then I never needed to, which is a good thing in itself."
,,,,,,,,"The bed was very comfortable and the room was fairly clean (some stains on the carpet - nothing too bad) but there is very limited space as the bed is king size and leaves only a foot or so on every side. It gets noisy in that area at night and especially in the weekends. However, if you are going to the convention center, there is nothing more convenient than this unit. It is right across the street! 
Raul was responsive to txt but I have never met him. It felt like everyone is in their own room and the shared space never used which made it slightly uncomfortable. Note, that there is another room in the house that is being rented out through Airbnb which was a surprise to me (I was told of this only on the day of arrival). The people in the other room were coming into the apt very late at night and woke me up (I'm sure unintentionally). Overall very satisfactory! "
,,,,,,,,"This place is right next to the Convention Center, which was just right for me because that's where I needed to be during thisstay in Austin.  Easy trip to and from the airport by $1.75 bus."
,,,,,,,,"Raul was very welcoming and helpful. The room was airy, well lit, and clean. Condo is in an amazing location! We would definitely return. Thanks for having us! "
,,,,,,,,Great place.  Walking distance to Austin Convention Center!  Raul was extremely clear and communicative.  Check in and check out super easy!
,,,,,,,,"This was a great location for visiting downtown Austin.  We did not meet Zac or Raul, however they were good at communicating with email and text and checking in and out was easy.  The room had a comfortable bed and city view."
,,,,,,,,Great Location exactly as advertised! The access was easy and it was literally across the street from the Conference Center for the SXSWEdu events. There were other guest staying there that were friendly and quiet. I would definitely stay again! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location! If you are a convention you won't find a closer place, and if you want the nightlife of 6th street it is real close (I figure if you stayed in a hotel, by the time you walk from your room to the elevator, take the elevator, and then out of the lobby to the street, you could easily have walked from Raul's to 6th street). Raul was great. Clear instructions, quick responses and everything you need. Room was perfect for what I needed - clean, comfortable bed, and the best pillow I have used for some time."
,,,,,,,,"Raul and Zac's place is exactly as advertised.......clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location to explore downtown Austin.  It was quiet, but close to all the excitement of 6th street.  "
,,,,,,,,"Neighborhood was fantastic! Really close to everything, great restaurants and bars. Quiet street. The apartment itself was really clean and the bed was really comfortable. Raul was super responsive and made check in really easy even though I got in late in the evening.  Highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,Great place in a fantastic location. The kitchen is fully stocked with all the utensils you could use as is bathroom and laundry. The rooms are a good size. It's just 2 mins from everything on 6th st. The entry into the apartment complex and the apartment itself is very convenient. Raul is always reachable and helpful
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. The room and place was exactly as it was described and the location is great! Would highly recommend staying with Raul and Zac.
,,,,,,,,"I can't say enough good things about Raul's place. First and foremost, Raul was great. Super friendly, always responsive, gave some great recommendations of things to do around the city, check-in/out was incredibly easy. The room itself was exactly as advertised. Very clean with a big, king-sized bed, your own bathroom, basically had one side of the apartment to yourself. The location of the apartment couldn't have been better. Easy walk anywhere around Austin-proper and, if necessary (though most of the time it was not), a 5-10 minute uber. There's also the #100 bus which goes directly to/from the Airport with a stop right across the street. If I could give Raul's place higher than a 5-star rating I would! Highly recommend staying here!! "
,,,,,,,,Great location that can't be beat.  Good communication from host prior to my stay and also provided helpful suggestions for hotspots nearby.
,,,,,,,,The place was immaculate and Raul made me feel very much at home. The location was perfect and close to 6th street.
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I were very pleased with the King-Size bedroom at Raul and Zac's home in downtown Austin. It was just two blocks from 6th Street so we were able to walk most places. And when it rained it was a short drive to other places like the Rainey Street bars and South Congress shopping district-- we drove our car and used Uber. The inside of the home was clean and everything from cleaning supplies to closet space to games to television were available and easily accessible. The place looked exactly like the photos. The hosts weren't there when we stayed the weekend, but Raul was very friendly and quick to respond via text from the time of booking to after we checked out. The only surprise was we didn't realize at booking that there's another room available for rent (2-bed twin room) in the home so we could've been sharing the home with other guests. Not a bad thing, but we were happy not to have to do that. Parking wasn't provided, which we did know, but we were able to park at the 3-hour limit meters during operation hours and leave the car there overnight. The location was quiet, comfortable and we felt safe. I highly recommend this Airbnb home.  "
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place and thanks for the favor loud experience. The place is better than described and it's in a fun and very safe area right next to everything. Not only was the transaction smooth and easy, but the host (Raul and Zac) were super friendly and accommodating. I was able to get tips and advices from Raul when I needed,  and not to mention the bus stop to the airport is right in front of the building (30 min bus ride to Austin airport). The apartment is clean in and out , and it's nicely decorated and felt like a lot of space. The street is fun and near all the bars and other hotels. Meter parking is also pretty easy while I was there, but the transportation nearby is too good to miss!"
,,,,,,,,Very convenient location for the Austin Convention Center just across the street.   Room and accommodations were excellent.  No problems encountered.  
,,,,,,,,"Location was exactly as described. Communication was excellent, and the hosts were courteous and friendly. Would recommend for anyone looking for a downtown location, or attending an event at the Austin Convention Center.  "

The latter of which not only describes the home, but also the company of Blair and his various houseguests/roommates. Blair and his friends have built a wonderful little community in this corner of the world, filled with love and laughter...I felt very honored to be a part, even if only for a few days :)."
,,,,,,,,"Blair's place was a great little haven away from a busy tech conference. Filled to the brim with art and photographs, and sporting wood floors, high ceilings, picture molding, woodwork, and old house charm, the house is still close enough to downtown that I walked to the Austin Convention Center (for a conference) each morning of my stay. Also close to the bus and a generous walk from South Austin. I was so busy I barely saw Blair and his housemates, but they were delightful when I encountered them."
,,,,,,,,"Blair a Ã©tÃ© un hÃ´te extrÃªmement accueillant. Il a fait le nÃ©cessaire pour que je puisse entrer facilement malgrÃ© mon arrivÃ©e tardive. Il a aussi Ã©tÃ© d'excellent conseil pour aller Ã©couter de la musique.
C'est une maison hors de l'ordinaire, dans un quartier agrÃ©able Ã  deux pas du centre ville. La maison est calme, trÃ¨s bien pour passer de bonnes nuits, En mÃªme temps, elle est animÃ©e et on y rencontre souvent d'autres gens, car Blair a beaucoup d'amis qui viennent lui rendre visite.
J'ai pu aller Ã  pied travailler chaque jour.

,,,,,,,,"This place was awesome! Blair was a great host, very friendly and welcoming."
,,,,,,,,Had a fantastic time in Austin for the F1 GP
,,,,,,,,"Blair was a super considerate host and the location is awesome. Not to mention the place itself is truly something to see, so much excellent art!"
,,,,,,,,Blair was a great host! He was very accommodating to my schedule. The location was very near where I needed to be and made it a convenient and quiet retreat. The art collection was incredible and the house and room was very spacious and cool. 
,,,,,,,,"Blair was an awesome host. Greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour of the place and made us feel right at home. The room and bathroom were comfortable and met all of our needs. Perfect location, a few blocks from sixth street. We were there for ACL weekend 1 and the house was a short 10 min walk to the shuttles that take you to ACL. For an authentic Austin experience, this is the place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in the Blue Room was wonderful; one of my favorite parts of being in Austin. Blair's home is walking distance or a short car ride to everything we wanted to see. The artwork in the house is so cool, and everyone staying there is awesome! "
,,,,,,,,This is the most amazing place to stay at in all of Austin - be SURE to visit Blair and enjoy the experience of Downtown Austin with a unique and memorable host.
,,,,,,,,This is really an extraordinary place to stay for a few days. Very eclectic home with a wonderful art collection displayed throughout. Blair was the most gracious host and made us both feel welcome and comfortable throughout our visit. Great location for relaxing quietly at home and easily getting out and about the city.
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at this beautiful house! Blair was so great to communicate with, very clear and helpful to accomodate my very late arrival. The space itself is really neat, filled with character with very a very intriguing collection of art all over the house. There was never a dull moment from when I opened to when I closed my eyes. Would definitely love to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Blair was a good host. He waited a couple extra hours to meet me when I messed up my schedule. The building is spacious and clean and is draped in art. I could feel that there were many many stories here and it made for a unique experience. The room is large and has a desk and a couple of chairs with lots of natural light.

It's worth noting that there is not a shower. I knew this ahead of time and am fond of large bathtubs so I appreciated a hot soak after a long day.

I met two other residents and they were super friendly and invited me to their Game of Thrones premier party one night.

I want to go back when I have some time to sit with Blair to talk about some of the paintings and photographs he has collected."
,,,,,,,,Blair made me feel quite welcome. I've no complaints whatever.
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at this lovely and original downtown mansion! 
Blair and the rest of the guys were very welcoming and helpful with directions and tips about the city. The bathroom is practicaly private as almost nobody else ever use it. Super comfy bed and plenty of space in the room. Will come back every time I visit Austin without hesitation!"
,,,,,,,,Blair was a fantastic host! The house is incredible. Great location and great value. 
,,,,,,,,Such a warm and friendly art-filled home! The thunder and lightning storm thru the large windows was spectacular. I enjoyed the room and the company for the full week and would definitely return. Met my needs as lodging for sxswedu convention center and conf hotels perfectly.
,,,,,,,,"What a great experience!  This mansion is close to the airport and within walking distance to so many fun places, music and food.   Blair was a fantastic host.   I felt so welcomed and comfortable from the moment I got there.   I would recommend this artful accommodation without hesitation."
,,,,,,,,"As others have written, this is literally the perfect location for a visit to Downtown Austin. It's hard to imagine staying anywhere else and touring Austin on foot. 

Some highlights: (1) Walk across the Chicago River, then follow the river/creek path to Barton Springs (and go for a cold but fun swim!). (REI is close to the room if you need swim gear. BookPeople is close by if you need beach reading.) (2) Get breakfast and snacks a couple blocks away from the apartment at Whole Foods. (3) Visit the UT Austin campus and the Blanton Art Museum. Even further north of the campus, drop by events at the (unassuming) Austin Zen Center. (Get lunch at Halal Brothers.) At UT Austin, I missed events at the Butler School of Music and the LBJ Presidential Library. Next time! (4) Wander down 6th street in the evening and pick any one of 10 options for live music based on sounds drifting across the sidewalk. (5) Walk across route 35 to get lunch at Franklin Barbecue (prepare for a 30+ minute wait). (6) Cool off and get some work done at Vintage Heart Coffee - try the iced vanilla latte.

Blair's Friday (early) evening book reading / salon was a terrific addition to my stay."
,,,,,,,,"A delightful and welcoming experience. Prepare yourself for color, personality, and high ceilings."
,,,,,,,,"Blair was an excellent host. My wife and I stayed for a few days and really enjoyed being so close to everything. The entire space is really cool and the room especially, which is covered from wall to ceiling with great art.  The futon is on a tempur pedic base and is actually pretty comfortable. Overall, we felt welcomed like we've been living there for a while. The room itself provides a good deal of privacy and can be locked from the inside as well as the outside.

It was our first stay in Austin and I'd highly recommend staying here again."
,,,,,,,,"This was my 2nd stay with Blair and it was just a wonderful as the first.  The house was exactly as it is described on the listing. It's huge, beautiful and very accommodating! The pictures everywhere are amazing. Blair provided anything needed and he was happy to assist with any questions about Austin. 
The room is just inside the front door and it's pretty darn quiet. The bed was super comfy and the location could not be beat! I was able to walk to everything I needed. 
Stayed here for ACL, and it is only 4 blocks from the shuttle, as well as Whole Foods and a number of bars, restaurants and nightlife! Will stay here every time I come to Austin! 
This house was really cool and the paintings/pictures are simply captivating. If you want a cool and unique experience stay here for sure. Thanks Blair! 
Scott"
,,,,,,,,"Blair made me feel very welcome. He did a good job of showing me the basics and letting me know that there would be plenty of visitors, friends and tenants hanging out in the living room (which was fine). It was always quiet at night time and early in the morning. The neighbourhood was also great. Close to grocery stores and local bars and restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,"This listing was very accurate, and Blair did a wonderful job to make me feel at home and at ease. He did a wonderful job explaining how everything worked, and was usually available when I had questions. He gave me great recommendations for places to eat and go see. I couldn't imagine a better place to stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"The listing description was very accurate.  The room was spacious, and had amazing art on the walls and ceiling.  The bed was low to the ground, but was very comfortable.  It was nice to have a parking spot so close to 6th street action.  Great location to walk to go see music and for going out!  The bathroom was just down the hall, and did just have a bathtub, but that was as advertised.  Very friendly folks in the house when we saw them, our room and that part of the house was relatively quiet the whole stay.  Nice people, clean house, amazing art, superb location, would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed my stay in the Blue Room tremendously. Upon arriving in Austin, I received a text from one of Blair's tenants who sent a friendly welcome and helped me check in speedily. The room itself was spacious and the accommodation had everything a traveller would need. While it may seem a bit far from the Austin Convention Center (for SXgoers) it was the perfect proximity. Once out the door, you're only a few steps away from the tail end of 6th street and the flagship Whole Foods. The Downtown Mansion was at times a nice retreat for a busy traveller. I recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,"Blair was a great host and made me feel very welcomed in his home. I came with the intention of having a relaxing getaway and staying at the Blue Room Mansion certainly delivered. You can spend a day just looking at all the artwork, chilling by the fireplace (check out the frolicking devils) and having a nice relaxing bath. Definitely will be back."
,,,,,,,,"Blair's place was gorgeous and very full of character (the number and variety of paintings he possesses really needs to be seen to be believed)! As a host, Blair was also very warm and friendly, and easy to reach for small housekeeping matters.

The room we were in was a little dusty, but nothing too bad (plus the bed, though not a real, full-sized one, was comfortable). We found the claw foot bath tub challenging to use, but then again we are definitely more used to modern showers.

Overall, the location was good for Downtown Austin; the house is historic and gorgeous; and Blair warm and approachable."
,,,,,,,,"Blair made my husband and I feel very welcome, it was like staying at a friend's place. His house is in a quiet and beautiful residential area that is two blocks from 6th...location couldn't be better. Highly recommend if you need to be near downtown. We did not need any taxis or public transport, we walked everywhere. Futon was actually really comfortable and the claw bathtub was nice too. As Blair makes clear in the place description there is no shower, your bedroom doors are sliding (but they lock) and there are other housemates and guests there--but we felt we had good privacy for all that. Blair apologized for having a party one night but it was a very laid back paella and sangria party that I think ended by (URL HIDDEN) yeah, it was family atmosphere, not like it was an obnoxious frat house. These are mature hosts that know how to be courteous to guests. Towels were really clean. "
,,,,,,,,"Staying at the Blue Room with Blair was great.  The house is amazing, covered in art, photographs, it was exactly the kind of place we wanted to stay while in Austin. I enjoyed the bathtub, and we had no problems getting in or out. I would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was exactly as it is described on the listing. It's huge, beautiful and very accommodating! The pictures everywhere are amazing as well. Blair was the host with the most for sure. Anything we needed he was able to assist with. The room is just inside the front door and it's pretty darn quiet. The bed was super comfy and the location could not be beat! We were able to walk to everything we needed. Stayed here for ACL weekend one- 4 blocks from shuttle. 4 blocks from whole foods also and a bunch of bars and nightlife! We would def stay here again. When you leave things in the fridge def put your name on them as warned. I did not do this and I lost some delicious breakfast tacos- totally my fault as I was warned. This house was really cool and the paintings/pictures are simply captivating.. If you want a really cool experience stay here for sure. Thanks Blair! You are one super cool dude- and a great skipper!  Tami&Scott"

Blair was the consummate host and we felt safe, secure and welcome in his period mansion."

The house is filled with artistic, intelligent, and friendly people.  I felt at home in a place I had never been!  Staying here made my trip worthwhile!  Thank you to Blair and the rest of the house.  I couldn't have landed in a better place!

The interior of the house is filled with artwork, and makes for an amazing experience, on its own!

The room is large and perfect for one person or a couple to share.  The bed is extremely comfortable.

You should too!"

,,,,,,,,"Blair was a wonderful host and the space was delightful! The floor mattresses were extremely comfortable, the house is gorgeous (LOVE the claw foot tub, art everywhere, and the jasmine growing at the entrance that made everything smell heavenly), and Blair couldn't have been more welcoming. 

My only regret is that I was so tired from my conference that my introverted self needed 'quiet time' when I got back to the house, so I didn't get to know Blair and the other folks. Everyone I met seemed truly kind, friendly, and interesting. I highly recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,Blair was a great host and his house is amazing. I would love to stay there again in the future!

The room and home are delightful. It was a treat to stay in a residence with such character.

I was looking for a walkable, safe location to stay for the AFF and the Blue Room Downtown Mansion was a perfect fit. (I was especially delighted to be so close to the massive Whole Foods a few blocks away.)

Highly recommended host and home. Hope to be back soon!"

I could spend days looking at all of the art, I felt like I was in a museum.  The location is extremely convenient, right downtown.  You are very close to all the Austin has to offer, while being on a quiet, tree-lined street in a safe, very nice neighborhood.  Highly recommend staying at the Blue Room Downtown Mansion.  "

,,,,,,,,Brittney was awesome and always responded almost instantly. She told me how to get from the airport to her place since Uber and Lyft don't work in Austin (ugh) which was super nice. Her place was maybe a 10 minute walk to the McCombs School of Business at UT which was amazing. Great place if you want to visit campus and lots of food right around the corner as well
,,,,,,,,Clean and spacious. I would stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,"The place was very clean. Brittney was very responsive, and ensured that I had easy access to her place, as well as information about transportation, food options, and the surrounding neighborhood.

"
,,,,,,,,"Brittney represented the perfect AirBNB host scenario for when they cannot be there in person to get you started. Everything was set up super simple and intuitive. She has thorough documentation of everything that required a bit more explanation. Her apartment was terrific and was in a location that was easy to get to (and back from) the sweet spots in Austin. Brittney was also very very responsive in every stage of our visit. Lastly, she provided us with extra provisions that were just the icing on the cake. That icing would definitely be delicious chocolate icing, because she also left chocolates."

,,,,,,,,"Jason was extremely responsive and helpful. The information he sent about checking in, exploring Austin, and amenities made our stay stress-free and fun. As the photos demonstrate, this is a unique apartment with decor that wowed us with its creativity, but that also was very functional. Really comfortable beds, and a great layout for our family of 2 adults and 2 adult children. The location allowed us to walk to bars and restaurants and explore the city on foot. Parking space also much appreciated!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome spot. Just as described in the bio. Easy to get downtown. Easy in and out of the complex. 100% will stay here again for my next visit to town. 
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place was lovely, as described and conveniently located. As a host Jason was super communicative, helpful and speedy. We had a great time!"
,,,,,,,,"Overall our stay was great! This place was exactly what we were looking for. I loved the open concept and all the windows were great to an extent. I didn't realize by the reviews I had read previous to our trip how bad the homeless community would be, it was very very sad to see that everyday. Also I don't know what the upstairs neighbor does all day but you hear furniture moving ALL the time and it sounds like a woman lives up there because she wears heels ALOT at crazy hours of the night. I guess my only complaint would be the level of noise, that corner apartment is a hot spot for fights, car accidents and a lot of homeless people hanging around. But it is walking distance to everything."

Jason's place was perfect for (URL HIDDEN) would also be good for girl's weekends, 1 or 2 couples, and families with older kids.  City living at it's best!  You are 2 blocks from the best part of 6th Street with all it's eclectic shopping, nightlife and restaurants.  This place is a great value and offers a lot of privacy.  A great 2 Bedroom / 2 Bathroom layout.  If you forced me to list one drawback, I'd have to say it's that there are a few homeless folks nearby as you'd find in any big city.  No issues at all though.  Private, gated parking for 2 cars was also a plus for us!"

The space was perfect for two couples to stay - it was clean, comfortable, and safe and the location was perfect for to walk downtown or a short cab ride away from most parts of town. Jason was extremely helpful coordinating our stay and provided us with excellent information about the area and accessing the apartment. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was as described, a very nice experience!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our second time staying at Jason's place. It's as great as we remembered it. Jason provides all the info you need and check in and check out is easy-peasy.

The condo is conveniently located downtown, right on 6th but just across IH-35 to be a little more away from the rowdiness of 6th, but starts to get into the authentic side of East Austin and the great businesses, shops, restaurants located on this side.  

The place is always welcome during the hot hot heat that Austin gets and during our stay the temps reached into the upper 90s. Jason's place was a cool getaway from that. The views are pretty nice and soundproofing is pretty good â€” the highway noise is barely noticeable. 

As always, a great place to stay."
,,,,,,,,Beautifully decorated apartment with great views of Downtown Austin. Just a few blocks from the action on 6th Street and Rainey Street. I would definitely recommend a stay here! 
,,,,,,,,Nice place. Clean contemporary interior. Good breakfast taco truck nearby.
,,,,,,,,"Really cool apartment, good location. Host was very accommodating."
,,,,,,,,"Love the house! Nice, clean, comfortable. We were a little worried about all the homeless people but the never approached us or made us feel uncomfortable. Would stay forever if we could!"
,,,,,,,,"The listing was definitely accurate for the actual location and quality of the apartment. The apartment was beautiful and Jason made sure we didn't have any issues getting access to the apartment and provided lots of suggestions for us to visit, which was nice since we were only there for a few days. I would definitely recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"Couldn't have asked for a better apartment for our stay in Austin.
The location was perfect with great views of the city, and was really quiet. Everything  within walking distance, and also handy for the car spots as we had a car during our stay. 
The apartment itself was very spacious and having the two bathrooms a bonus.
Jason provided great information for us and checked in to make sure we had all we needed. 
Couldn't recommend this place enough!"
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay. The place was perfect and very clean and location was excellent. Thanks Jason. 
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was perfectly located, clean, and quite modern/nice. Jason is incredibly helpful and responsive as well. This is how a visit to Austin should be done. "
,,,,,,,,What a great place to stay and so convenient to everything downtown.  Jason was easy to communicate with and even checked on us on our first night in town.  Perfect stay!
,,,,,,,,"Jason's condo was great. Perfect location just blocks away from 6th street, and great food. "
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay in this modern flat. Great location. Jason was really helpful and responsive.
,,,,,,,,Jason was pleasant to work with and responded to my inquiry promptly. The listing was accurate and the home was as nice as the photographs posted. The location was ideal and the price point made this place even more valuable. 
,,,,,,,,Amazing modern appartment with a stellar austin skyline view. Jason is extremely good with communication and super easy to work with. Location is close to everything but the neighborhood is still up and coming with  a lot of homeless people in the area however the condo is a new modern gated complex. 
,,,,,,,,"Jason's home was beautiful and immaculate.  There was a high end coffee maker with an endless supply of excellent coffee, cold waters in the frig as well as other treats.  We just could not have been more pleased.  It all made for a wonderful stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Best listing in Austin hands down. Location is close to every nightlife activity. Definitely staying here again when i go back down.
,,,,,,,,Everything about this stay was great! looks just like the pictures. Accommodations were beyond expectations. I would definitely recommend to others and might even return for another stay! 
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at Jason's. Clean and stylish apartment in close proximity to plenty of entertainment. Jason communicated effectively. 
,,,,,,,,"I could not have asked for a better stay!!! The place is so clean and convenient. we did a girls trip for the weekend and felt like we each had our own suite with our own bathrooms and comfortable beds. It was a great place to come back and rest in after a long day of exploring in the heat! Thank you, thank you!
"
,,,,,,,,Loved it! Jason made sure everything was running smoothly. The place served perfect the two of us 
,,,,,,,,"What a lovely home!  Great location, beautiful, clean, nice extras, great AC, comfortable beds, wonderful shower, airy rooms and very well appointed!  We couldn't be happier, and Jason was a great host.  Getting in and out of the apartment was easy.  Don't hesitate to stay here."
,,,,,,,,The apartment was amazing with a panoramic view of downtown. It was very central to sixth street. Perfect locstion! The Host was easy to Get a hold of. I highly rekommandert a stay here!
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I stayed at Jason's apartment for 5 nights and we absolutely loved our stay. The apartment was very clean and conveniently located. It is at walking distance from the bars on 6th St., but far enough that we were able to sleep peacefully. A plus is the gorgeous panoramic view of Austin. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Very clean in an awesome location. We didn't rent a car and were still exploring the 5th day just on foot. Plenty of great food, any bar scene or music you could hope for. Host was great with excellent directions on how to get there and local suggestions."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Jason's apartment was a great experience. It is easily accessible, very comfortable, and tastefully decorated. It is very luminous and spacious. Jason made available to us all sorts of amenities, from Ac, TV and wi-fi, to coffe making machine, laundry, etc. The apartment was spotless.     "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic apartment for our trip to Austin. Jason was very helpful in answering any questions and letting us drop bags off earlier than check-in time. 
There are some interesting characters under the highway overpass on the next block, but the apartment complex was secure and it is a great location to easily get downtown and around Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Jason apartment is just great- modern design, clean and all is new. Having it own parking is also very useful.
I enjoy the stay and found it very convenient as I came for a conference at the Austin Convention Center which is only few blocks away."
,,,,,,,,"Jason's condo was well equipped and close to everything - and was ""as shown"". Being close to everything had its advantages and we rented bike's from ""Mike's Bike's"" and toured around the City for 2 days. The downside is the proximity to so much 'humanity'. Crossing under I-35 at 7th at night was a little 'sketchy'. But Jason's place was great. Jason was proactive in his communication and pretty responsive. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful apartment with a great view and a great location! Everything was very clean and setup to make are stay comfortable and easy. Jason even followed up with a quick message to make sure everything was going as expected.
,,,,,,,,"The view of downtown was beautiful and everything you could possibly want to do is in walking distance. The apartment was immaculate and Jason was a great host. He was quick to respond and check in/out was easy. He provided a coffee bar, water, and a bunch of different toiletries. We really enjoyed our stay!"
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at Jason's apartment! it is so perfectly located and wonderfully comfortable. I had everything that I needed, Jason was super responsive the entire time. 

I can't wait to come back and stay again, and I highly recommend this listing!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a great host. He was able to accommodate a very late check-in, and he even followed up with me during my stay to see if I needed anything. 

The loft was stunning - even better than the photos. It was very clean and well decorated, and there was plenty of nightlife within walking distance. I would highly recommend booking Jason's loft when you are visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,Our stay was wonderful! The apartment was clean and check in was easy. Location was perfect for getting around the city. Jason had everything we needed for our stay! 
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic stay! Everything in the condo was just as described and in mint condition. Not to mention the apartment is in a great location, only blocks away from the Austin convention center.  Jason is a great host and responds to requests very promptly. Great find."
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I went to Austin for her 30th birthday for a weekend and we absolutely loved Jason's place.  It was immaculately clean, loved the coffee pods for the morning, and was fully stocked so we didn't run out of any necessities.  As far as the decor, loved how he decorated, very artistic.  He was a great host, with great tips on what to do and the best ways to see the city.  Overall, we loved this place and will definitely be returning for trip 2! "
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment close to the centre of the city. Beautifully presented and well looked after, it was a pleasure to stay in. There are nice touches - the excellent coffee machine, proper sized bars of soap, power sockets in all the right places. Jason was careful to ensure we had everything we needed. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,The apartment looks even better in person - and incredibly clean (my biggest concern when booking on airbnb)! Jason was an excellent host with tons of recommendations. We couldn't have asked for a more convenient spot. We didn't want to leave! 
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a great host, we had everything we needed. A great location , gated parking and a wonderful all glass view. The decor was classy and festive! We would be happy to stay there a third time and more!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect! 
,,,,,,,,"Had everything we needed, the gourmet coffee pods were a nice touch!  Awesome decor, conversation pieces everywhere you look! "
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriends and I had a memorable first experience of Austin, Texas. I recently went to Austin for my 27th birthday. I must say Jason was a great host. He had thorough instructions, great tips, and was very accommodating. Jason's residence is modern and well kept. As a California gal, I felt at home and comfortable. Also the location of his residence was very convenient. "
,,,,,,,,Jason gave so much helpful information allow for a seamless check in and visit. His pad is very comfortable and location is perfect! 
,,,,,,,,"Jason's loft apartment looks great in photos and even better in person. I was also pleasantly surprised to find a tub in the spacious ensuite second bathroom and super comfy bed. His loft is conveniently located in East 6th just a few blocks from a ton of noted bars and restaurants. All are in easy walking distance or one can bike, uber and drive there in mere minutes. Though the exact block that the loft is situated on has some sketchy characters, as a female big city native it did not give me too much cause for concern. "
,,,,,,,,"My stay at Jason's place was incredible. The place is clean, quiet and very conveniently located! Walking distance to downtown and any night life you could want. Jason was very accommodating and his communication is impeccable. I would highly recommend his place to anyone looking to experience Austin!"
,,,,,,,,This was a very good AirBnB experience. Everything was as described. The place was in great condition and the location was perfect for what we wanted. Jason was helpful and responsive.
,,,,,,,,"Jason was very accommodating. He set us up with suggestions on where to go and what to do! The location was perfect too.  A short walk to all the happenings on 6th street.  Which is where all of the festivities occur in Austin.
Jason also supplied shampoo, conditioner, and soap for the showers! It was such a positive experience. I know where I am staying next time I visit Houston!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a great host. His instructions were very clear as to how to get into the apartment/complex. The listing was just as described and a very nice place at that. Extremely well kept and a comfortable home. We were pooped one night, so we stayed in, had pizza and watched some of the movies he has in his collection. The neighborhood comes off as a little rundown at first, as it is on the edge of downtown and residential East Austin. It seems as though it is being quickly developed. Regardless, it is 2 blocks from the happening 6th St strip, which was extremely fun and convenient. Great place and I highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,Great place. Great experience.
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is outstanding. Is beautiful, clean, has a tasty decoration and the location is unbeatable. He is also a great host, he covered all the details to make us feel comfortable during our stay, he provided very clear instructions for all the process and he also was ready for quickly answer my questions. I will look forward to stay at this place for my future visits."
,,,,,,,,This was my first experience with Airbnb and Jason's place was amazing! It was beautiful and in a great location. I recommend this place to anyone interested and definitely give it the highest rating possible!
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a perfect host. The apartment is gorgeous and in an incredible location. Jason could not have been a better host and the apartment is a dream. We even stayed in one night as we wanted to make the most of it, perfect! Jason is so communicative and helpful and polite, just great. x "
,,,,,,,,"SWANK! We had a great experience staying at this downtown loft. Jason's place is luxurious, clean and super comfortable. Loved being walking distance to restaurants and bars, too. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Great place in downtown Austin, directions for getting in were very concise. "
,,,,,,,,"Jason's downtown loft was perfect. Even though it came with two parking spots we chose not to get a rental. Most places were in walking distance. Uber was easy as well. The apartment itself was gorgeous. We had some friends over and entertained a few times before going out. Very clean and felt very safe, as it was a gated complex. I would definitely stay here again if I had the opportunity. There is so much being built in Austin right now I'd love to see how the neighborhoods continue to get developed. "
,,,,,,,,Jason was great and provided excellent instructions and made us feel at home. The location is excellent!
,,,,,,,,"We had a very nice time staying at Jason's.  The location was great and the space vas comfortable.  The balcony was really spacious considering the location of the unit.  The pictures were accurate.  Overall, it was a great experience and we would highly recommend.  We would also stay there again for a future visit."
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is amazing! Pictures don't do it justice. Jason keeps his apartment perfectly clean and has everything you need for your stay in Austin. A week before our arrival Jason sent me detailed instructions on how to access his place and any details we might need. He also provided a list of must see places in Austin which was super helpful! If we ever venture down to Austin again, Jason's place will be on the top of my list!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place was absolutely perfect.  It's in a great location with lots of fun and interesting places within an easy walk.  The view is spectacular and there's even a little patio/balcony area in which to look out over downtown Austin.  The bed's themselves are extremely comfortable and luxurious and lent themselves to several good night's sleep.  He even provided coffee and creamer for my fiance/wife and her two bridesmaids saving us an emergency trip to the nearby grocery store.

All of this is more or less readily apparent based on the photos and various reviews but it's worth reemphasizing how easy Jason makes everything.  Getting access and checking in was a breeze.  He offered us a fairly comprehensive list of recommendations on things to do, places to eat and so forth which I greatly appreciated and I considered over and beyond the call of duty.  Though there was absolutely no need to contact him it seemed very clear to me that he was there if we needed him and that his goal was to help, make sure we were comfortable and that we had a good time.

I would not hesitate for even half a second to stay there again and I highly recommend his place if you're wanting to explore the vibrancy of Austin.  Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Jason's place is the perfect location for folks visiting Austin.  His space is beautiful and centrally located to Austin cultural activities.  He was very communicative and swell to work with.  I'd definitely recommend his place!
,,,,,,,,Jason made check-in a breeze.  His communication was on point and the place was amazing.  It's within walking distance to all the great city of Austin has to offer.  I highly recommend staying at Jason's home if ever looking to book accommodations for future travel.  
,,,,,,,,"Jason's apartment is gorgeous. The decor has been updated since the photos were taken and the apartment is actually significantly nicer than shown. Check in was a breeze and Jason responded to messages instantaneously. Location wise, the apartment is situated about 80 feet east of i35, on 6th street. Very close to everything, although the immediate vicinity (as in, directly downstairs) is slightly removed from the heart of downtown west of i35. In the summer heat, we chose to take cabs everywhere, but these rides were short because the apartment is relatively close to everything. Overall the experience was great, and I would definitely stay here again. The place is awesome."
,,,,,,,,"This place was amazing! 
5 minute walk to downtown. Beds were supper comfy, everything we needed was supplied. I've already recommended it to a friend. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was great.  It was actually larger than expected.  Jason has decorated this condo well, and he keeps it clean and in very good condition.  The location is good as it was a quick walk to all of the restaurants and clubs on 6th street and in downtown."
,,,,,,,,"Loved this spot on east side of Austin! Right off 6th Street & Brushy, it was close enough to walk anywhere downtown. A great view of the skyline, the chill balcony area and the open, simple & sleek loft made our trip much more comfortable. We will definitely be using Jason's loft again in the future if at all possible! Everything was very clean and the decor was amazing! Absolutely no complaints here."
,,,,,,,,"We received our email with instructions for our stay about a week in advance. Jason was awesome and provided very explicit instructions for checking in/out, and an added bonus was that he provided some cool sightseeing and dining suggestions.  The apartment was immaculate. It also had an awesome view of the skyline. It was a perfect location for our stay, as it was just a few blocks to the 6th street bars, two blocks to a rental bike location, and had a cool food truck park nearby. Our stay at this apartment was awesome and we wouldn't have changed a thing. Thanks Jason!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason gave us all the information we needed ahead of time and we had no problems at all during our stay. The condo was clean and in a safe location - it was perfect for our trip. Also, the location couldn't have been better for our stay in Austin - it's right at the edge of the strip of restaurants and bars on 6th street, but if you go the other direction on 6th you will find awesome restaurants and bars that locals visit. I would highly recommend staying at Jason's!"
,,,,,,,," Outstanding!  Location, welcome instructions, description of property, communications for smooth arrival.  Everything about Jason's property exceeded expectations. I would highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,Jason was very helpful when I had questions leading up to our stay. He was very prompt in response and was very pleasant to work with. I highly recommend working with him and staying at this location.
,,,,,,,,Great apartment in great location. Easy to explore Austin on foot from here. Jason made check-in and check-out very simple. Will definitely return.

Thank you, Jason, for all your kindness, generously and hospitality! I'll definitely stay your place when I could go back to Austin again! 
YOU (and YOUR PLACE) are THE BEST HOST EVER!!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome apartment.  Really modern 2br apartment right in the heart of Austin.  Walking distance to a lot of bars and restaurants.  Jason was a great host and provided us with a ton of information in advance of our stay.  I would 100% rent from Jason again if I were visiting Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! I stayed in Jason's condo for ten days and didn't want to leave! You can read all the other reviews to understand how great the place is, and how excellent Jason's hospitality is, so I won't elaborate further on what's already been said. I will say that the location is perfect! I could walk to tons of restaurants and bars, and even an great donation yoga studio. We had several movie nights and dinners in because the view is better than at any restaurant in town. This is a great condo to just relax in. Oh, and the photos show a small two-person dining table, but now Jason has added a great four-person set. I am really picky about beds and bathrooms and loved Jason's place! "
,,,,,,,,"Great spot for downtown access.  Jason was a great host.  Clear, simple instructions to get the the unit."
,,,,,,,,Jason's place was amazing. It comes exactly as advertised and has an ideal location. Jason provided great directions for access to his condo and even provided helpful suggestions for things to do/see while in Austin. I would highly recommend this spot for your stay in Austin. You will not be disappointed.
,,,,,,,,"Jason sent an extensive letter prior to us arriving with complete details of how to find his place, how to get in, places to eat and visit in his area.  This loft is very easy to find and in a great location!  Plus, it was nicer then we had expected.  Love the dining table with attached stools!  The Kuerig Coffee maker complete with different flavors of coffee was so welcome. It was also wonderful to have the air conditioning already on when we arrived in 98 degree weather.

,,,,,,,,Terrific space.  Just across I-35 from Downtown.  Very good instructions and easy to get in and out of.  It was a two bedroom so it was way more space than I needed so I will probably invite a friend to share the space during the next conference.  Loved the coffee machine!!   
,,,,,,,,Jason was an amazing host. Very organized and helpful. The apartment is also excellent. This is one of the best rental experiences I've ever had. 
,,,,,,,,"First airbnb experience and couldn't have been better!  Great apartment, awesome neighborhood and Jason made the whole process seamless. A+"

A reasonable price and overall an excellent experience."

An AAA+++ experience. 
Would recommend to anyone looking to explore the downtown Austin area. 
The condo was in a great location, we walked to the 6th at nightlife. 
Condo was neat, clean and ready for guests. 

Jason was very understanding despite a mistake on my part about departure time. We stayed an extra 2 hours and he was very understanding. 
Thanks again!!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Jason's downtown loft.  The pictures are an accurate representation of the space, however, they don't do the location justice.  A great view of the Austin skyline from the windows inside as well as the outside balcony.  The condo is situated such that you walk out the door and you're just steps away from all the activity of 6th Street.  We never met Jason, but he provided all of the details needed for an easy check-in/check-out and a comfortable stay.  I would have absolutely no reservations about staying here again and will actually look forward to it."
,,,,,,,,"Jason's apartment was just perfect! We had two couples staying there, a lot of room, very clean and loved the ""coffee bar"" he has set up for guests. We felt like we were at home. It's also very convenient location to and from. We will definitely stay again!"

The location is ideal - easy access to 6th Street, RAINEY Street, the highway, and downtown.  Plus, it's only 15 minutes from the airport!  Highly recommend a stay here if you are looking for a fun week/weekend in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean and in a very handy location right on 6th Street. Well within walking distance of great food and places to have a few drinks, and also very close to congress. Great communication from Jason which was easy to follow so check in and out was a breeze. Also the ability to have offstreet parking was great, although we didn't use it as we relied on walking and public transport. Would definately stay again and would recommend to friends."
,,,,,,,,"Jason provided clear instructions re apartment and immediately resolved any questions and concerns we had with the property.  Jason is courteous, polite, and helpful.   "

Included with the apartment were all the essentials, linens, wifi, parking spot, sound system, etc.  Would highly recommend renting Jason's apartment. We had a blast!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect and as promised!
,,,,,,,,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it did not disappoint!  Jasons  place was amazing! Even nicer then the pictures and such a central location to everything you could or would want to do in austin!  
His instructions were spot on and his tips for the area were impeccable.   He was overly aaccommodating and very flexible. Good lordy the bed was comfortable too!  Can't wait to go back and stay here again"
,,,,,,,,We are SO happy that we picked this apartment for our stay in Austin! The location is excellent. You can go walking to many places and have easy access to main ways in town. The apartment itself was impeccable: very clean and comfortable. The views of downtown Austin (including the Capitol) are incredible. Definitely would love to stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"This is an amazing apartment- well worth the price. It's ideally located, the view and the balcony are amazing- super comfortable, fully stocked- you couldnt ask for more"
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a wonderful host.  He left a detailed message about his apartment plus coffee and water in the fridge.  His apartment had a great view, a nice balcony and lots of room.

Eric D"
,,,,,,,,"Oh wow. Where to start. 
First off, the pictures fully represent how awesome this place is. It's obvious the pride that Jason takes in his home. Which, is the reason I believe  he his place is so nice and comfy. I believe this to be an excellent value considering the location. Which brings me to my next point, holy crap the location! It is right on the middle of the famous 6th street. It is a short walk to so many wonderful bars, restaurants, and food trucks. It is also, a less than 10$ cab ride to most of he rest of Austin. 

This was my first trip to Austin and Jason's place helped make it perfect. The only downside of the trip is that I had to leave.   "
,,,,,,,,"Jason's was good as advertised, great place in a great location. I would highly recommend Jason's place to anyone visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time using airbnb and it was a really great experience. Jason checked in with me the day of to ask if we needed anything and also on the day that we were checking out. Really nice, relaxing, modern loft. I will be back if I ever find my way back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent!

- Great decor & amenities. Top notch. Looks exactly like the pictures.
- Great views of the Austin skyline
- Nice balcony for drunk-people-watching
- Easy check-in & check-out (no need to wait for someone to check you in & out)
- Great location (in the middle of 6th st). Everything is pretty much walking distance. There's a gas station & Wendy's next to the place if you need something"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was great and as listed. Everything was very easy and the accommodations were perfect.
,,,,,,,,Jason's home is top notch!   Large urban home with a balcony that overlooks the ebb and flow of 6th street.  Just an easy walk to all the different clubs and if one didn't partake in the trip on 6th sitting on the balcony people watching was at it's best!   The condo is very luxurious and comfortable.  There's a food truck nearby that makes decent breakfast burritos.   Check in and out was extremely easy.  I will recommend Jason's place to family and friends!   Top notch excellent host and home! 
,,,,,,,,"Despite my best intentions, I rarely review restaurants or accommodations, despite frequent traveling. However, I had to make sure that anyone that is visiting Austin to experience the city knew to stay at Jason's condo.

The booking process was very smooth, and Jason provided very clear directions on how to check into the condo. The location is absolutely perfect for those who want to experience the real Austin - you are able to quickly be in East Austin, as well as the famous 6th street area. Other great areas like Rainey Street are without an easy walk. U of Texas is an easy drive, and the condo is located right next to I-35 if you need to travel further. The condo has a gated parking lot, which is very convenient. 

Inside, the condo is very clean and tastefully decorated to match the modern style of the building. It also features a great view of downtown Austin. The two bedroom / two bath setup is perfect for multiple parties traveling together.

"
,,,,,,,,Stayed at the modern condo in downtown Austin walkable to everything - perfect getaway for a week - the host was very communicative 
,,,,,,,,"Can't say enough great things about my stay, Jason's place was so close to everything in the town (walking distance) comfortable, and upscale as well. I will most definitely be referring this place to anyone I know traveling to austin in the future."
,,,,,,,,Great apartment made for a great stay in Austin. Thanks Jason! 
,,,,,,,,"Jason's loft was a great find!  His place was clean, comfortable, stylish, creating a  very welcoming experience for his guests.  Walkable to the downtown core as well as to numerous trailer food parks in the area, I was happy with the location overall, even though upon arrival, the neighbourhood looked a little sketchy.  I felt very safe once we settled in.  Jason was a truly great host -- great communicator, easy to work with, paid attention to detail.  This was one of my best airbnb experiences yet.  Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,What a great place to stay. The location was perfect and made it easy to walk to many downtown locations. The apartment was clean and spacious and was a relaxing place spend our down time.   Jason was accommodating and easy to correspond with. I would definitely stay again and recommend this loft for others to stay.

,,,,,,,,"Jason's place was SPECTACULAR!!!!  It is within walking distance of downtown fun.  Our son was on military leave for the holidays and we were able to celebrate a family Christmas that reminded him of home.  Jason has a full kitchen.  We were able to cook our traditional Christmas meal, communicate with family over the internet, and watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation as we do every year.  The loft is as great as the pictures.  Jason was a GREAT, very responsive host and he made everthing so simple for us.  I definitely recommend this loft.  The kids loved it, my husband and I loved it, and we had a great time.  If I could give it more than five stars, I would.  

Thanks, Jason!  "
,,,,,,,,Jason was very helpful. His home was beyond beautiful. Definitely go back as soon as possible. 
,,,,,,,,"Both this property and its owner, Jason, were amazing! The condo was beautifully furnished, perfectly clean, and stocked with everything we needed from a Keurig coffee maker to hair conditioner! Additionally it had an AMAZING VIEW of downtown!!! Jason was available by call or text for any problems that we could have encountered. Jason also accommodated several personal requests. My fiancÃ© and I had just gotten engaged, and Jason provided a bottle of champagne. He also personally reviewed a list of things to do in Austin that we sent him ahead of time and provided suggestions. He even let us use his personal printer when we needed to print off something unexpectedly. Finally, we accidentally left our coats in the condo. We contacted Jason right away and he happily agreed to mail us our coats! This was an amazing place to stay close to downtown. We would definitely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason is a pro.  Not one detail left out, very clear, very cool person.

The place was great, exactly as advertised.  Very urban feel, near some cool things (taco trucks and brew and brew are by far the best 2 things).  2 bedroom worked fine for my business partner and me.

Gated condo development near downtown.  Would strongly recommend."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location, had all the things we needed. Would definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,This place is exactly what my wife and I were looking for. We were able to walk to sixth street or hop in the car and go exploring without any hassles. To us it just doesn't get any (URL HIDDEN) awesome place ant an awesome host. We will be back!
,,,,,,,,"We spent two nights at Jason's apartment in late October. The apartment itself is exactly what it looks like in the photographs. The apartment was extremely clean and Jason left bottles of water and coffee for us to use which was a nice touch. The apartment is beautiful, well air conditioned and it is a five minute walk from the bars at 6th street. We found it very convenient especially given that Jason had secured parking spaces for us to use inside the premises. Jason's instructions and mini-travel tips for Austin were easy to read and were very useful. Jason was also contactable at any time. I will definitely try to stay here when I come back to Austin! Thanks Jason."
,,,,,,,,Cool mod apartment. Stayed with another colleague for a business trip. Great location - walk dowtown / run on town lake trails. Easy parkng situation.
,,,,,,,,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay & explore Austin. It's not only a great, comfortable space but convenient to 6th st, Congress & Downtown.  Great Experience from arrival to departure!!!  "
,,,,,,,,"Simply great! Everything was set up perfectly, the location in relation to everything in Austin was absolutely convenient! I do enjoy the fact that our host, Jason, does a great job of sending over information that you might need during your stay. He also gives you a few recommendations to check out in the area, if you are at a loss on what to do in the downtown Austin area. And the fact that he also includes water bottles, little bottles of toiletries, and an abundance of towels to use is definitely top notch! Loving the selection of K-cups coffee in the morning is always a plus. The pictures say it all and more. If you're staying in the downtown Austin area to see the sights and sounds, this place is the perfect place to feel like you're home away from home. I'm definitely coming back to this apartment, whenever I am coming back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great condo w/ a fabulous location Easy walk to all the 6th
Street and surrounding areas. Class A in all respects!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place was awesome.  Great spot for vacation in Austin.  In addition, Jason was prompt in answering our questions and facilitating the entire process.  I would definitely stay there again on another visit."

The space itself is well-appointed with great art, details and lots of room for two people. It'd be great for two couples as well. 

Lots of nice details â€”Â shampoo/conditioner/soap, towels laid out, Keurig coffee maker, impressive TV system, and just overall, that boutique-style, modern and hip style that beats all of the hotels in the area. "
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is amazing. Huge loft style space with massive open kitchen/lounge. Both rooms were very spacious and really nicely finished. It reminded me of something from a boutique hotel. The balcony was great with a liquor store only feet away!

Perfectly located on dirty east. About 10 minutes stroll straight down the road.

Jason was great to deal with. Easy instructions on how to access the apartment and some great recommendations for restaurants and bars.

Highly recommend. If I'm ever in Austin again I would definitely stay in Jason's"
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is IDEAL for anyone wanting to visit Austin in truest unique style. Everything from the decor to condos central location was above and beyond any expectation.

Thanks Airbnb, thanks Jason and thank you Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Jason's apartment exceeded all expectations. The location and layout are ideal for any traveler.  Walking distance to every downtown location. I will always search availability for this apartment before heading to Austin.

,,,,,,,,"Jason's apartment is really fantastic:  very spacious, well-appointed, and he goes to great lengths to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  As a former Austin-ite, I loved the location, too.  It's very close to everything to see and do in the city--you can even walk to a lot of places downtown.  Overall, I highly recommend Jason and his apartment."
,,,,,,,,"The place was conveniently located, spacious and clean. We had a great experience staying in Jason's loft. Will recommend others too."
,,,,,,,,"Great two bedroom apt close to everything. I had a conference at the Austin Convention Center/Hilton, and it was only a five minute walk door-to-door. I had a car, and Jason let me use one of the parking spots in the gated lot. The kitchen was well equipped for cooking all types of meals. Jason had a nice Keurig with a great selection of coffee to get going in the morning. Easy to communicate with via email and text messages. Would stay again. Make sure to go swimming in Barton Springs Pool in the morning and bring a mask and snorkel. There are some big bass down in the deep section!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is amazing!  The pictures definitely do not do it justice.  The entire apartment is amazing laid out incredibly well and the balcony has a wonderful view of the Austin sunset.  He was an incredible host and had all the amenities a person could ask for!

We barely had to drive anywhere since there's so much to do within walking distance and when we did, his location was so central to everything that we never had to drive very far.

I had a great time staying there and I highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment. It was just as the pictures showed and described. We were very comfortable and we wanted for nothing. It was a great place for us to relax, particularly for the nights we stayed in.
Jason was a great host - providing thorough details to get to the place, instructions re equipment, even providing water & beer (great touch). 
Thanks for the suggested activities - Alamo Drafthouse Cinema was a highlight!
We highly recommend this apartment to other air bnb users."
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is great!!!! The best view in town. It was Very clean, temp. was great during the summer,plenty of extra towels. soaps,
shampoo and more.
He really takes care of the small details! The condo is walking distance from ""the hussle and bussle"" of downtown Austin! The condo is 2 blocks from "" FRANKLIN BBQ""
We had a late flight back to Los Angeles, and Jason made arrangements that we could stay longer then Check out time"
,,,,,,,,"Awesome!  Everything is as pictured, just gorgeous and very comfortable stay.  Will definitely stay here again.  Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at Jason's was definitely one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. The place was beautiful, even larger than the pictures indicate, and very, very clean. Jason was also kind enough to leave coffee, plenty of water, and great bathroom amenities. The balcony was the perfect place to unwind at the end of the day, and the location is great -- not only because of all of the cool places you can easily just walk to, but also as a starting point to getting almost anywhere in the city. Additionally, Jason was very communicative and friendly from the start, provided excellent information and instructions before we arrived, and really went out of his way to help us out. I also appreciated that Jason has a ""grown-up"" kitchen, with all that you need to prepare great meals if you choose. I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend Jason's place to other Airbnb users."
,,,,,,,,I've been here a few times this is an amazing place amazing location and amazing host everyone would love to stay here
,,,,,,,,"This place rocks. Totally clean, totally sleek, the perfect bachelor pad. (Note: I don't know what the perfect bachelorette pad looks like, but I imagine women would also enjoy this apartment.) 

The location is perfect: striking distance to the crazy part of 6th street, but right in the cool, more relaxed part of the sixth street. Also, Jason is some sort of motocross champion and has decorated the apt with his trophies, so it's fun to imagine that YOU are a motocross champion while staying there. Vrooommm!

If it's in your price range, you won't be disappointed by this apartment."
,,,,,,,,"Jason's loft is incredible! The space is immaculate. Seriously, I have never been in a cleaner or tidier apartment. And the location is prime-- minutes from a lot of hot spots on 6th street. Fresh water and Keurig-brewed coffee were at our disposal, as well as cable tv and some seriously great water pressure. 
Plus, a few days before our arrival, Jason sent us a guest letter that had everything we needed to know and more in it: info on getting into his apartment, where to park, and tips on what to see and eat in the city. Jason's place will be first on my list should I ever make it back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was beautiful, and looked exactly as it did in the pictures. Walkable to tons of bars, restaurants, etc, there was never a shortage of things to do. Also, the balcony was great at night!

Will be recommending :)"
,,,,,,,,Jasons place might be the most beautiful place I've stayed in. The pictures don't do justice for just how large the loft is. The view from the living room of the Austin skyline is quite a sight to see itself. Everything was perfect and Jason was extremely accommodating to our needs. Hands down best place to stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"You would be hard-pressed to find a more incredible spot, with this much room and amenities.  A few minute walk has you in the heart of sixth street restaurants and night life.  Jason was a great host, he immediately responded to any communication and I would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason's loft was a great place to stay.  Loved the decor as it fit in very well with my own design esthetic. Very centrally located, great views of downtown.  Gave lots of info about town ahead of time.  Would definitely stay there again if traveling to Austin. Thanks."
,,,,,,,,"Jason is a fantastic host, with a loft just as good.
Before arriving he gave us a sheet full of stuff to do and directions to his place.The checkin process was super easy and straightforward.
His Loft is very close to the midtown action in austin, a very easy walk to restaurants and clubs.
We stayed for the V8's at the C.O.T.A. and it was super easy to get to from here, about a 20min drive.
Thanks for a great stay Jason and highly recommended!!!"
,,,,,,,,"All of the positive reviews regarding Jason's place are spot-on! This place is ideal for visitors who wish to ""experience"" Austin in a non-traditional tourist-y way. It's truly in the heart of the East Downtown bar/restaurant scene (walking distance to Eastside Kings - a must!). At the end of our days of venturing throughout the City, this place felt like we were going ""home"" and looked forward to being there. His place is spacious, very well-kept, clean, modern, creatively inspired, and felt like a five-star accommodation. We were grateful to have the opportunity to stay there and look forward to booking it in the future."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome property, great view, classy appointed, great location with easy access to airport & walking distance to downtown.   Really enjoyed staying here and the owner Jason was great to deal with.  Top notch all the way.  Highly recommended if you get the chance to stay here while in Austin.  I know I'll be checking availability here first next time I visit Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"My recent stay at Jason's place in Austin was nothing short of AMAZING!!  What a class act from start to finish.  The directions, access, and communication was great and effortless.  The condo is perfect!  2 great bedrooms, 2 amazing bathrooms, views of down town from every window, kick ass stereo and kitchen.  The place is located within walking distance of just about everything you need - from great restaurants to the crazy bars on 6th east.  There is a great wine store just up the street - funky food trailers all around, public transit at the door if you need it.  Jason provides some great personal touches to your stay like coffee and water waiting for you, shampoo and conditioner and soap for you.... I would recommend the place to anyone!  I will so be booking when I need to head back to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a fantastic host that made our first time visiting Austin such a breeze.  His loft is beautiful and is walking distance to the attractions on 6th street.

,,,,,,,,"From start to finish our stay was perfect! Jason sent great instructions on how to get to his place and get in.  His home is clean, modern, and comfortable and is perfectly located close to everything. The view is amazing, the bedrooms and bathrooms are large and comfy. The TV set up was great for movie watching. It was really the perfect place for our stay. We had a great time. It was my husband , my brother, his wife and I.  We are all busy parents who wanted to get away and relax and we couldn't have picked a better place!  Thank you Jason!"
,,,,,,,,"I can't say enough good about Jason, his lovely loft and the city of Austin!  We didn't end up renting a car, but because the loft is located on the edge of downtown, we were able to walk most anywhere.  When we did want to get out a bit further we just hopped a bus right below our unit on the corner.  How's that for convenience!  The bus system in Austin is great ($2.00 / 24 hour ticket) and the limited stop bus from the Convention Center out to the airport worked great on our way out of town as well. By using the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Map app for bus info made getting around super easy!   
Jason's is a top-notch host with top-notch accommodations who promptly answers any questions you may have about his place.  No need to hesitate here!  "
,,,,,,,,"Jason's loft was beautiful, clean and had GORGEOUS views of the Austin  skyline. The location was perfect for a night on 6th, a quick jog to the lake and was easily accessible from the highway. Jason's place also has all the convenience of a high-end hotel as he leaves little bottles of shampoo and conditions for guests as well as bottled water in the fridge and other amenities. We felt so at home here. I HIGHLY recommend booking a stay the next time you are in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Emma and I canâ€™t recommend our Austin accommodation enough. Jason is a fantastic host. Heâ€™s helpful, responsive and organised. Everything from initial contact to checking in and out went really, really smoothly. And his apartment is amazing. If you like what you see in the photos, youâ€™ll love what youâ€™ll find when you check in. Itâ€™s beautifully furnished and immaculately looked after â€“ it feels more like a five-star hotel than somebodyâ€™s house. Location is great too. Itâ€™s really close to Rainey Street which has some amazing bars (look it up). Itâ€™s also really close to 6th Street if thatâ€™s more your style. 

Emma and I only have one regret â€“ we should have stayed longer. Austin is an amazing city and we really didnâ€™t do it justice in the three days we were there. Jason â€“ you may just see us again someday. 
"
,,,,,,,,"Best place to stay in Austin! Jason's listing is a super comfortable,safe, and swanky place and walking distance to 6th St.! Jason gave us a great document on how to get to his place, as well as fun things to do around town. I couldn't recommend his place more if you're looking to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,A couple of my girlfriends and I spent the weekend in this condo and it was perfect!  The condo is very clean and in a great location to walk to 6th Street bars / restaurants.  Jason was very responsive and helpful.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
,,,,,,,,"Jason's loft is perfect. Very clean, bright and within walking distance to all the best east side spots. I will definitely be staying here again next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Jason was very communicative. Getting to his place was a piece of cake with his detailed instructions. He even emailed us to make sure that we got there safely our first night. His place is great:clean, spacious, and comfortable. And it gets bonus points for being only 0.3m from Franklin BBQ. "
,,,,,,,,"Jason's loft was the perfect place to stay because of the clean and spacious layout, great location and excellent views of the downtown skyline.  Jason was a very gracious host and we definitely plan on staying here anytime we are in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is great! Huge, light, airy, great decor, comfy, good location. And Jason is super helpful and easy to deal with. "
,,,,,,,,Jason's loft was amazing. Great location and extremely clean. Jason left precise directions for easy entry and was glad to answer any questions. The little extras like travel toiletries and Keurig were provided and very much appreciated. Will definitely use again! 
,,,,,,,,"Stayed here for 5 days/4 nights with some friends for the ACL festival and the apt was AWESOME.  Beautifully decorated, great amenities and perfect location.  Apartment was spotless and just a wonderful place to call home while staying in Austin.  Can't say enough good things about it!
"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed at JasonÂ´s place for 3 days during an business trip in Austin. It could not be any better. This place is just awesome, very comfortable, clean and way better than staying at a hotel. Just a few blocks away you will find many restaurants and great bars on 6th street and the convention centre is also very near. I can highly recommend JasonÂ´s place and definitely would love to come back, when IÂ´m Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a great host - timely on communication, great instructions on getting in and helping with a great weekend for us.  The place was very clean, fresh and as advertised.  Our small group loved the location, the views, the ease of getting in and out and the overall experience was very good.  We will book again if we head back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a great host giving us plenty of advice on where to go and the place was amazing. Perfectly in the center of 6th street with plenty of food trucks and bars nearby. Jason even left us mini toiletries in each bathroom and stocked the frig with waters. My buddies and I were in Austin to celebrate a bachelor party and all of us couldn't have been happier with the choice we made to stay at Jason's loft. If I am ever back in Austin, this is surely the place I will book! Thanks."
,,,,,,,,"Jason was responsive and extremely accommodating. His place was better than advertised and better than any hotel we could have stayed at. Its location, just blocks from 6th and a 10 minute walk to Rainey Street was so convenient, we were able to walk most places when we couldn't cab it. If you're thinking about staying anywhere else in Austin, don't. You're going to want to stay here. I'd recommend this to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"The perfect place to stay if you are going to check out the local hangouts! Walking distance to 6th street. The warehouse district is a quick cab/pedi cab away. South Congress, barton springs, Town Lake running trails and paddle boards are so close, and of course there are awesome restaurants around every corner. Jason's place rocks! Immaculate with a beautiful view of the Austin skyline. Very cool furnishings and artwork. We will be staying here again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"Jason was a great host.  Every thing was clean and ready for us.  He offered some water bottles and coffee for us to use. He is extremely thorough in his information every base is covered.  Couldn't ask for a better experience. 

 Jason we will be back, expect to  hear from us soon!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying in this apartment is like being inside a beautiful snowglobe placed in the center of Austin with views of downtown and the surrounding area. It's also comfortable, with every amenity you can imagine. The apartments gets a little too bright in the late afternoon/early evening, so we draped a scarf over the window. Overall, it was delightful. "
,,,,,,,,The place was great! We will be staying here again! 
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is absolutely fabulous. It is exactly as it appears in the pictures, so wonderfully decorated, and super clean. The location is perfect, it's right in the middle of 6th St, with great bars, restaurants and live music either side. Despite being near the highway, it is still pretty  quiet. Jason was readily available and responsive at all times, and goes out of his way to provide special touches, like leaving toiletries and even a toothbrush! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this place to anyone venturing to Austin (which, may I add, is a brilliant city in itself!!). Thanks Jason, I'll be back! "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic place, great location near all the East 6th attractions, and wonderful host.  Jason made everything extremely easy and was great to deal with.  Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Jason has an absolutely fantastic place, well placed, well situated, well stocked. Good communication too."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great host. Easy access, centrally located, clean and fresh on the inside - would not stay anywhere else. Thanks Jason!"
,,,,,,,,Place was lovely and very accessible to downtown. Very nice with modern appliances. Jason was helpful and responsive. Thanks for an awesome stay! 
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! The instructions for arrival were easy to follow. The place is spacious, easy to be 2 couples. Lots of appreciated perks--bottled water in the fridge, toiletries in case we forgot. Parking very handy since we could walk to many locations and still feel ok about leaving the car. Modern, clean. Would go back."
,,,,,,,,"Blown away by everything about this place. The location was great, it was super clean and it had about everything you needed for the kitchen/bath. I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in downtown Austin. From my family and myself....Thanks Jason!!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great experience at the loft apartment- the apartment is beautiful, has great bedrooms and common area. Loved the coffeemaker and the location. We walked to just about everything in central Austin including great bars just around the corner.  Jason made check-in and check-out super easy."
,,,,,,,,This place is amazing and Jason is a great host.
,,,,,,,,Beautiful view. Very clean. Fun decor. Comfy beds. Fully equipped kitchen. The best water pressure I've ever experienced. Convenient to downtown. Across the street from a great wine bar. We hated to leave.
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful experience in this downtown loft. The loft has a great view of dt, and let's in a good amount of light, so u don't feel closed in. The 2 bedrooms were clean comfy and cozy.There were Great special touches, like toothpaste, waters, and coffee. 

This place is close enough to walk down to 6th street for some night life.
We visited Pete's dueling piano bar, and had a blast. Your also close enough to the food trucks and restaurants. We visited uncorked, which is literally a hop, skip, and jump away from the loft. The food and atmosphere were fabulous. 

I will definetly be staying at this loft again. : )"
,,,,,,,,"Immaculate! Interesting architectural and decorative touches. Excellent, secure location with easy access to Interstate 35 and 6th street. Quick stroll to some great restaurants. Nice view of Austin skyline from livingroom windows and balcony."
,,,,,,,,"I want to leave a poor rating...just so no one rents and the space will be open for when I return to Austin! However, I could never do that to Jason. He was a great host. Although we never met in person, he was as helpful as can be via e-mail and over the phone. The day before my arrival, Jason sent an e-mail with all of the instructions and information. Coffee and water was offered to me while I stayed, as well as access to a DVD collection. In the bathroom(s), in case I forgot toiletry items, travel-sized  shampoo, conditioner, and shaving cream were waiting on top of a fresh supply of towels. The place was clean, beautiful looking and just plain awesome. Rent away -- except when I want to come back."
,,,,,,,,"Everything was amazing!! This was my first airbnb experience and it lived up to my expectations and exceeded them. Jason was super nice and helpful; and was easy to get ahold when I had questions. The loft was gorgeous and in walking distance to everything. We only used my car twice, only because our destination was too far to walk. If I'm ever in Austin I will definitely go through Jason again. "
,,,,,,,,"What a wonderful experience for a first time airbnb user!  

Upon arrival Jason showed us around, also pointing out that he had some toiletry items in case we had forgotten anything (I did end up using some of his sunscreen and a toothbrush).  He had 2 sets of keys for us, told us we could help ourselves to the coffee, and gave us the remote control for the autogate in the parking area.  He was so incredibly friendly!

Now the most important part, the condo, it was fantastic!!!  Very contemporary with a huge flatscreen tv, great speaker system that we could plug our ipods/phones into for music, comfortable couches, and a great deck.  He had towels/washcloths set out for us as well.  The place was spotless and the beds very comfortable. 

We could not have asked for a better location.  If we werenâ€™t in town for a wedding and needed to drive outside of town, there would have been no need for a rental car.  We walked absolutely everywhere in Austinâ€¦ South Congress, Dirty 6, West 6, Campus.  Everything s really at your fingertips from this location.

If I ever go back to Austin I will for sure see if Jasonâ€™s place is free!  Thanks! :)"
,,,,,,,,Jason was an excellent host.He was ready to please us anytime.The place was faboluose.Excellent location.Close to everywhere at Downtown Austin.Very clean and comfortable!We do recommend Jason and his property withouth any hesitance.GOD Bless Him!!
319759,5,10,10,10,9,10,9,"Great place, great location, even better hosts! Perfect place for big groups. "
,,,,,,,,"Great space for a big group. For our first time in Austin, we could walk everywhere and enjoyed some places recommended nearby from our hosts."
,,,,,,,,The overall experience at this property was fantastic. It truly is a great location being on 6th street. There were ample toiletries and the house was stocked with everything you need. At night the view from the roof was great. The only issue that we had was with the hobos around the property. I believe this is something that you can definitely look past due to the solidity of the property and the security on the property!
,,,,,,,,"GREAT communication from booking through the stay. Check in was a breeze, everything was keyless and the host was extra accommodating with beds to ensure each person in our large group had an individual bed. Place was clean and just as pictured. Plenty of bathrooms and common area. They even left us some ""party supplies"" the previous party had left behind. Bonus, our group left behind a few loose items and they even mailed them back to us - amazing stay, great service, thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was easy to reach and super helpful.  The house was awesome - so large, you can easily sleep 15 people.  Funky, cool decor.  Beds were comfortable and roof deck was large! Walkable or easy cheap fastens to everywhere you want to go. They even left us some local beer and champagne.  The key code was awesome with so many people coming and going. Great spot - will be back!"
,,,,,,,,Great house for a big group! Very helpful on arrival!
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing experience here! We were greeted when we arrived, and were told all relevant information about the area and the house. We had a party of 16 people and there was plenty of room. We can't wait to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Took 11 guys from California on our annual trip and had a an absolute blast. This place definitely lives up to the expectations in the photos and did not disappoint. Thank you so much!
,,,,,,,,House was incredible
,,,,,,,,"10 total guys 30ish stayed for 3 nights for a bachelor party.  Clint (property Mgr) met us promptly when we arrived and gave us the scoop on the place and surrounding areas.  I reached out to Clint a couple times on the trip (small leak in downstairs bathroom) and every time he answered right away and sent someone over to fix.  So... Hosts are great!  The place is great for a bachelor party...10 guys and we all had our own bed.  If you don't want to share beds, I wouldn't recommend more than 10.  House is walking distance from all 6th St bars and Rainey st.  We walked everywhere... Super easy.  It was raining so we didn't get to use the top deck.  Lots of towels, clean sheets, stocked with everything you need.  4 out 5 stars ... A little more attn detail on the house would creep it closer to 5... Again.. Great spot for Bachelor Party..."
,,,,,,,,"The place is huge and is perfect for a large party! Me and 14 friends were here for a bachelor party and there was not shortage of space or things to do around the area. There is a converted garage on the first floor filled with beds. The second floor is the living area with a kitchen, living room area with a sound system and TV, and a patio. The third floor has two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Finally the private rooftop deck!

Kristen and Clint were also great! There are plenty of suggestions and tips that were provided for things to do/see and for using delivery services to stock up the house with food and beer. Everything was great! We had a great time and definitely would recommend this place to others!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great stay at the Swanky Townhome. We rented it for a bachelor party of ten guys and everyone was more than comfortable. Clint was very helpful upon arrival and always quick to respond to any questions we had during our trip. The location was ideal as we could easily walk to any number of bars, restaurants, or stores. I would highly reccomend staying here, it will definitely enhance your Austin experience. "
,,,,,,,,Our group had a great time at this place. The hosts were extremely accommodating and were easily reachable if needed. If you're coming to Austin with a large group this is the perfect place to stay.
,,,,,,,,"Upon arrival Clint made us all feel really welcome and gave a guided tour of the building. We were in awe as the place was even better than we expected, the pictures do not do this place justice.
Being so close to 6th street was great for our group as we wanted to enjoy our 4th July break. "
,,,,,,,,Overall my experience in the Swanky Town House was amazing. I stayed here with a group of 12 for a bachelor party and the space could not have been better. The location was perfect and the roof deck was an awesome feature. Clint and Kristen were the perfects hosts and I would definitely recommend the Swanky Town House to anyone planning an Austin vacation.
,,,,,,,,"I traveled to Austin with what was originally going to be 13 guys for a bachelor party. We ended up losing 2 the morning of as we were heading to the airport (their loss).  In the end it was probably better we lost the 2 because the place can accommodate our 11 better than the 15 that was stated it can accommodate.  Clint and Alexandria were great hosts and were very helpful. Alexandria met us at the home and was waiting for us to arrive. Any questions we had they answered for us quickly and everything went smoothly.  Upon arrival, it was a little different than I expected from the pictures, possibly smaller? And also the neighborhood it was in.  The house was clean like the pictures shown which is very important to me. The neighborhood has A lot of homeless people across the street right in front of the place and on your walk to  the 6th st bars. I know it's a city and homeless is expected but we were not told in any of the reviews about this and it was a little disconcerting to us at first and also unpleasant sight. One night they were knocking on the door and garage door which was kind of annoying but other than that they stayed to themselves. On the walks to 6th, they would do the normal things homeless people do, sleep, talk and beg. It is a city after all.  

The house has tons of towels and the neccesities. The only thing it really was missing (which would of been great) was the umbrella upstairs that was pictured in the ad. That would of been helpful in the Texas heat for sure. So really the upstairs was used at night time or else you would bake. 

Overall, it was a great experience and a very fun city (new Orleans style).  If this place was 2-3 blocks closer, it would of be unreal and you would of been in the center of it. The house was great overall with those few things I've mentioned as the not so great part 
-the accommodation of ""x"" amount of people, because even with 11, someone had to sleep on the couch. Didn't find the air  mattress either
-no umbrella upstairs on the deck as the pictures show there is one.  Could of used an awning (that would be even better)
-the neighborhood it was in. Little different than expected and what was shown. 
-overall , I'd recommend this place Bc it had great hosts and it's very good location to where all the fun begins. We walked everywhere. "
,,,,,,,,"The Swanky Townhome was an ideal property for my bachelor party that comfortably slept 11 of us. The location made it easy to walk to the bars and restaurants on both East 6th Street (up and coming, hipper area) and Dirty 6th Street (fun, touristy area with mechanicals bulls and live music). Rainey Street was only a short 5 minute cab ride away. The property itself set the mood for a fun time -- comfortable but with an edge. The main living room / kitchen and upstairs roof deck were ideal gathering spots. 

A few bonuses: The market and taco food trucks across the street; ping pong balls; some complimentary vodka from and beer; blue tooth speakers on roof deck and Apple Play for the living room.

In all, we had a blast. Thank you Kristen and Clint!"
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing time staying here for our Bachelor Party experience. The place was clean, well-stocked, and one of a kind. In Cahoots couldn't have been more helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get a full Austin Experience."
,,,,,,,,"I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for my visit to Austin.  We had a group of 15 guys and everyone was able to sleep comfortably.  The location was spot on - about a five minute walk to 6th ave.  Clint greeted us at the townhouse by showing us the entire home/rooftop and answered any questions we had.  I will 100% be contacting Clint/Kristen if I make it back to Austin in the future. 

Thanks for a great trip, 
Eric"
,,,,,,,,"We had an awesome time staying at the townhome. Clint met us as soon as we arrived at the property to give us a tour and answer all of our questions. He also gave us recommendations for dinner places, day activities, and nightlife- all of which were spot on. He was readily available throughout the trip to answer any questions that came up. He couldn't have been a better host!

The house was in great shape. Comfortable beds, updated amenities, enough sheets/towels for everyone. We had a big group but could comfortably hang out in the main floor or on the roofdeck. 

The location was perfect for our large group. Everything we needed was close by- grocery store, coffee shop, taco truck, beer/liquor store all within a block. It's a very easy walk to nightlife but isolated enough to avoid the craziness of ""Dirty 6th"" if that's not your scene. 

I will be recommending this property to any friends traveling to Austin in the future. We really couldn't have asked for a better stay or a better host!"
,,,,,,,,"Came here for a bachelor party with 15 guys and had the best time! Everything about this townhome was perfect. The location was great....there's a gas station and a liquor store across the street and we were walking distance to the 6th Street bars. Also, the private rooftop deck has great views of the city. I would definitely rent this townhome again."
,,,,,,,,hosts were very welcoming and informative
,,,,,,,,"Clint and his team did an excellent job.  We loved the house and it was perfect for our bachelor party.  I was the best man and they made everything so easy for me.  The house easily fit our group of 12 and if you wanted to double in a bed, you easily could have fit 2-5 more people.  Thank you for your hospitality!"
,,,,,,,,AMAZING !!!! Came for bachelor party 17 guys all together and we had a great time . The house was perfect ... Location was right in the middle of all the good spots to go . And the hosts were very helpful and attentive ! Thank you again
,,,,,,,,"Clint and Kristen were unbelievably helpful! We were a bachelor party of 11 and this place was perfect for us. Rooftop was great, plenty of room and excellent location. Would recommend this property to anyone! "
,,,,,,,,"Great modern, clean house. Close proximity to all spots in Austin ($10-15 uber ride max). Rooftop is great, as advertised. Would certainly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"I traveled to Austin with a group of 9 for a bachelor weekend. This property was everything we needed and more. It was clean, beds were superbly comfortable, and cabinets/fridge were stocked with alcohol which we were free to indulge in. Kristen, Clint, and the Inn Cahoots team were prompt and professional in responding to any questions we had. They also provided us with a list of local bar & restaurant suggestions. I would certainly recommend this property to friends!"
,,,,,,,,"Definitely an excellent decision to stay at this place as it was spacious enough to accommodate our large bachelor party, but also very convenient towards getting food or going out. I highly recommend as the hosts are quick to respond and are great towards explaining the nearby area and help with anything should the need arise. The fridge was packed with local beers which was awesome as well."
,,,,,,,,"The house was PERFECT for our large Bachelor party. The hosts were VERY helpful as far as the best of Austin and flexible with check in and check out times, not to mention the fridge already had local Austin beers stocked. The rooftop is a HUGE plus and something you won't find in other hotels. This is THE place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"House was awesome, everything as advertised.  Hosts were really helpful and the house being stocked with beer when we arrived was a nice touch."
,,,,,,,,"What a great location and an ideal place for a bachelor party!  Clint was awesome during the walk-through explaining the area and the house.

I would highly recommend this place for a large group bachelor party.  "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great and professional.

Location Location Location was superb!!!!!!

Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.

Long Live the King!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place for a large group-- we had 12 and there was more than enough room.   Staying here was miles better than being separated into a bunch of hotel rooms.  Clean, nice view, and easily walkable to a lot of great places on and around 6th street.  Beyond the place itself, the hosts were very quick to respond to any questions, really flexible with our check-in, and went above and beyond as far as recommendations and making sure we enjoyed ourselves.  Would definitely recommend to anyone traveling with a group.  "
,,,,,,,,"Epic. Location is amazing.  Walk-able to 6th, Rainey and the college are super easy.  Ubers/Lyfts super easy to get to the house if you need to go somewhere else also.   House was just as pictured.  Great party pad.  We have 14 and were plenty comfortable with tons of room.  100% would recommend this place and stay again.   Great hosts who were constantly in contact to make sure we were having a good time and had everything we needed.  Couldn't have been better!"
,,,,,,,,"The Inn Cahoots team did a great job for us for our stay in Austin.  They were flexible on times and offered to make some airport runs.  The apt was great and perfect for our purposes of a 13/14 person bachelor party.  The location was also ideal as it was close to downtown, not far from ACL and has a liquor store, gas station convenience store and a Wendy's right there.  Solid food trucks were just around the corner as well.  We had a great weekend and I would highly recommend this property and the Inn Cahoots team."
,,,,,,,,"Great place, perfect for a big group. Everything was clean, comfortable, and walkable to bars and restaurants on 6th Street and Rainey Street. The rooftop deck was a great place to hang out and has an awesome view of the city and a lot of foot traffic. The hosts were very accommodating and even stocked the fridge with a few cases of beer to get us started. "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent accommodations - perfect for our bachelor party (13 guys).  House was clean, spacious and everything was as advertised. Location was super close to all the nightlife and bars.  Our hosts were responsive up to and during our stay.

Towels and shampoo was also provided.  Would certainly recommend to my friends and would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Overall this place is pretty ideal for bachelor parties in terms of short distance to bars/downtown Austin, # of big beds, and all the other essentials bachelor parties need + some.  We texted our host when we landed and he met us 15 minutes later at the house.  We had no major issues with the place, and even the minor issues, were taken care of by the host without hesitation.  They even provided us with some Austin beers to kick off our weekend.  Overall worked out perfect."
,,,,,,,,"The hosts were all extremely kind and helpful.  The condo was amazing - plenty of room for all 14 of us, amazing roof deck, and the beds were super comfy!  Clint was really helpful in letting us know the ""hot spots"" that we must go to in Austin.  They were also very understanding and flexible about the check in/check out times since we all arrived/left at various times at the beginning and end of the weekend.  Overall, we had a fabulous weekend!"
,,,,,,,,"This is by far the best house to rent for large groups! We had 12 guest for a bachelor party and everything we needed was in walking distance to the house which saved us a top of money on taxi's and Uber costs. We met with the property manager Clint who was over accommodating and all around a cool guy! The rooftop was great for sunsets and I give this whole experience, from booking to checking out, 10 out of 10! Will definitely be referring this house to friends and family who plan on visiting Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location and space for a bachelor party (group of 6). Clint was very helpful in showing us around when we arrived. The selection of local beers was a nice addition. Overall, I would recommend for a large group. "
,,,,,,,,"This townhouse was everything we could have asked for and more.  The location is perfect, and the amount of space was great.  We were here for bachelor party and had plenty of beds to house everyone. Clint met us right on time, and provided lots of different local beers for us to try out.  The house was fully stocked with linens, towels, and toiletries.  Location is ideal for walking to anywhere on 6th street, and you can't beat the views from the roof deck.  

I would definitely recommend this house for anyone looking to have a great time in Austin.  Kristen and her team were great throughout the whole process."
,,,,,,,,"A group of 12 girls came to Austin (most for the 1st time) and stayed at Kristen's place. Our experience could not have been better. The townhouse is the perfect place to stay... the location is close to everything and the setup of the house was more than expected and slept everyone very comfortably. The house was stocked with everything we needed, even keurig coffee cups :) Clint worked with me from the time of booking to check out and was THE BEST HOST I have ever had. He is truly an expert when it comes to Austin day & night life. He gave us the best recommendations for exactly what we wanted. All in all, this was the best Airbnb experience I've had and we would definitely stay there again if we go back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The Swanky Townhome on 6th does not disappoint!  The Inn Cahoots team were all incredibly accommodating.  They were cordial, inviting and this townhome's location is an easy walk right onto 6th.  We were a team of 11 and this place was the prime location for everything.  

They were readily available any point before, during and after the trip, were willing to be flexible with our schedules.  They offered plenty of recommendations and could not be more top notch. This team and location could not be more better!  

They also welcomed us with beers and K-cups for our visit. Uber is vibrant in Austin and there are plenty of drivers to get you to and from places and will drop you off right in front of your unit.

If we come back to Austin, this is with whom we plan to go with once again!  Thank you guys for everything!"
,,,,,,,,Stayed here with 10 other guys for my brother's bachelor party and I must say this was EXACTLY the house we were looking for. Very conveniently located and perfectly accommodating all of our needs for a very reasonable price. Thanks Kristen!
,,,,,,,,"Rented this place for a bachelor party of 15 guys and it definitely made the trip. Prior to arrival Kristen was able to answer any questions we had in a timely fashion. Upon arrival, there was someone at the place to greet us, shows us around, answer any questions, and see if we needed anything. They had local craft beer for us to have which was a nice addition. There was plenty of room for everyone in the place to sleep and get ready. It was great to not have to bring towels and showering supplies as the place already had everything. The place is in a very convenient location, can easily walk to 6th and Rainey St. Also there are a lot of really good food places nearby. Kristen and her team are dedicated to making sure that you have a great time on your trip to Austin. Would definitely recommend this place to future groups. "
,,,,,,,,"I rented this house for my bachelorette party for 13 girls and it couldn't have been more perfect.  It was exactly as depicted in the pictures and had plenty of room for all of us to have our own space and so many different areas to hang out.  We tended to congregate on the roof the most because the weather was so nice and the view of downtown was awesome!  Clint met us there and showed us around and made sure if we needed anything he was readily available.  They had gotten us all sorts of Austin beers to try, which was really nice and above what most hosts would do.  The place was clean and the beds were really comfortable.   Everywhere we went was 10 minutes from the house, it is in the best location!   Couldn't have been happier with the service, location and home itself.  I'd definitely rent it again if I went back with a large group!"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen is a pro.  She was available to answer all questions before arrival.  When we got to Austin, 2 helpers were available via text 24/7 to let us in, give us a tour, and answer any questions.  

The place was fully stocked with goodies. Local beer, booze, snacks, even a box of cupcakes which was a nice touch.  Soap, shampoo, cleaning supplies, etc were all fully stocked too.

The place is near the street/ partially on the ground floor, which you wouldn't imagine in photos.  Specifically the big 6-bed room, which is a converted garage.  It wasn't an issue at all. Assuming you're tired out by the sun at the end of the day, it won't matter.  It didn't bother us.  If you're a family, and you're there for peace and quiet, it might be a little noisy.  

Overall, an amazing setup. Perfect for us. Thanks Kristen!!!"
,,,,,,,,"A great place and even better hosts. Very conveniently located close to all of the action in downtown Austin. Perfect for big parties that want to all hang out together rather than rent several hotel rooms. Excellent roof deck!

Kristen and her team checked on us several times, left a few thoughtful gifts and were highly responsive."
,,,,,,,,"The place was in a great location, and our bachelor party of 8 had plenty of room. The complimentary bottle of scotch was very nice, and the rooftop deck with Bluetooth speakers was also fantastic. "
,,,,,,,,"This house was exactly as advertised and we had such an incredible stay there. The decor is awesome and funky but still functional - and the house is very clean. Kristen was communicative and helpful leading up to the trip, and her colleague was on call 24/7 to answer all of our questions throughout the weekend. The rooftop was AMAZING. beautiful views and the bluetooth speaker situation was awesome. The beds were so comfortable in all of the rooms, and we honestly loved every single part of the experience. There was a liquor store across the street which was so convenient and the location was perfect to access all different parts of the city. We stayed there for a bachelorette party and have friends there staying for a bachelor party this summer. Recommend it for any type for group stay!"
,,,,,,,,"The location of this condo is perfect for experiencing the entire city by walking. We had 12 girls stay at the house for a 30+ year old bachelorette party and it fit everyone well.  There are two bedrooms upstairs each with their own full bathroom complete with shampoo/conditioner/soap, one king bed and one with a queen bed and a twin. The middle floor has a really cool kitchen and living space with a cool view, a half bath and a smaller deck. Downstairs is a large room (used to be the garage it seems) with 6 double/queen beds, all with comfortable bedding. There is also a full bath downstairs. We felt very safe. The beds/linens were extremely comfortable, it has a cool vibe to the place and everything you need in the kitchen to cook. The roof deck is large with nice furniture and an awesome view! Kristen and her team were very accommodating and came running if we needed anything at all! I would suggest this for a large close knit group that doesn't need a lot of privacy, especially for the downstairs set up."
,,,,,,,,"The house was awesome, especially the roof. The neighborhood was awesome. We couldn't have had a better time. Highly recommended for anyone taking a large group to Austin. Jessica was really helpful when we arrived, and she even brought us some beers. You won't be disappointed!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great weekend at the townhouse. It is well maintained, clean, and had plenty of space for a party of 8. Great location and an awesome rooftop deck. Kristen was very responsive and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking for accommodations for a group! "
,,,,,,,,"This house is like nothing you've ever seen before.  It is in a perfect location within walking distance to the 6th street bar scene as well as Rainey Street.  I went down to Austin for my bachelor party and this house fit 14 of us very comfortably. 

Kristen is the best host you could ask for.  She made sure to have someone at the house when we arrived to welcome us and followed up to make sure we had everything we needed. 

Don't look any further, this is your place if you're in Austin.

-Ahmad"
,,,,,,,,"Stayed here for a 13-guy bachelor party and it was all we could have hoped for. Kristen was so responsive, helpful, and accommodating throughout the entire process. It was a great experience.

Townhouse: Very impressive. Even after seeing the website of the photos, everyone was really impressed when they arrived at the apartment. It had the space to accommodate a large group comfortably and the 3.5 bathrooms were really clutch. The rooftop was really nice and had outdoor Bluetooth speakers and plenty of room.

Location: Great. It was a short walk to all the fun on Dirty 6th street, Rainey Street, breakfast taco trucks, etc. The only time we used a cab all weekend was to/from airport and to SaltLick BBQ which was a 30 min drive away. 

*If you have a large group and need transportation anywhere (gun range, SaltLick BBQ, airport, etc.)  ask Kristen or Jessica for the contact info for Travis. He operates a group van and was great and was very reasonable."
,,,,,,,,"Host: Kristen was great. She was very responsive, nice, and left great suggestions. She is also extremely accommodating. 

Apartment: The apartment was amazing. Huge rooms, clean, plenty of space, great for small parties or big parties. All of my buddies enjoyed the place. It also has a very nice rooftop. 

Location: the location is perfect. Very close proximity to all the major bars. There is quick and good tasting food across the street, as well as this awesome bar/coffee shop a block away. "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was the perfect host! From meeting us at check in with a delayed flight right through to leaving she was most accomdating. 
Apartment was perfect for oue stay and highly recommended! Perfect for parties and close to everything you need in Austin! Coming all the way from Australia it was great to have such a perfect stay with no worries at all! And a fully stocked bar was a hit!"
,,,,,,,,Great time. Kristen was easy to work with. The place is even better than it looks online and the location is perfect. There was plenty of space for 6 friends and the stocked bar was unnecessarily kind. Great Texas experience.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen and her team were great! After a quick text when I landed in Austin, I was greeted at the townhouse when I arrived, given a tour of the place and enjoying the case of beer we were greed with! Everything I needed to know was spelled out in the information card in the kitchen and the weekend was a breeze. Just to note, there were 11 of us staying here for the weekend. We were all very comfortable and there was plenty of roo for everyone. There were plenty of linens, kitchen ware and other small items so we only needed to shop for some groceries. "
,,,,,,,,Great location.  Fantastic rooftop deck.  Hosts were very helpful with local information and welcoming us on the first day.
,,,,,,,,Great neighborhood in a central location. Kristen was very accommodating and the place was beautiful.
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely loved the house - this was our second stay at the Swanky Townhome on 6th street. Everything was well organized and clean and accommodating for our stay over the weekend. Instructions were very clear on how to leave the property too. 

Kristen does a fantastic job of making sure there are ample items of luxury for guests and I really recommend this property for groups visiting Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen (and the condo) were fantastic!   Location is ideal for those wanting to experience downtown... beautiful views from the living area and rooftop.   For both check-in and check-out, I was impressed by the flexibility in timing, which was a huge help.   I only have positive things to say.   We never had to think about anything lodging related and due to having a large group, the communal spaces were such a bonus compared to hotels.  "
,,,,,,,,The house was perfect for a trip with friends. It's walkable to bars and barbeque. Everything was as described and the hosts made sure everything was ready and very helpful getting us everything we needed. Will stay here on my next trip to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Kristina and Brian were great hosts and made us feel very welcome! the place is really nice, nicer than we had imagined.  We had a few hiccups along the way but our hosts were quick to respond and make sure our stay was perfect."
,,,,,,,,My stay at Kristen's place couldn't have been better.  The place is exactly as advertised - right in the heart of Austin with easy access to the entire city.  Kristen was extraordinarily helpful and hospitable before and during our stay.  If I'm ever back in Austin I would not hesitate one bit to stay at this great townhome again.
,,,,,,,,"Overall the place was accommodating and we had a great experience! 
"
,,,,,,,,"The place is amazing! Kristen & Brian are very nice and accommodating. 
We were 10 people for a bachelor and there was more than enough space for everyone to sleep in a bed. Very convenient location for going out at night as well."
,,,,,,,,"Landed in Austin on a hot Thursday evening and were greeted by Kristen's work partner Tasha.  She checked us in, showed us all around and answered any and all questions we had.  The Loft itself was AMAZING!!!  Perfect for large parties and right in the middle of both parts of Austin.  And like stated in other reviews... it was perfectly clean and had a fully stocked bar to our amazement.  On Saturday Kristen and her husband Brian stopped by to say hello, hung-out for a couple hours and even brought us another nice bottle of scotch.  They were amazing to work with and always available to answer any questions we may have had.  Our group could get a little rowdy and noisy at times but they were always cool with us and let us know when to take a down a bit.  I would HIGHLY recommend their place to anyone traveling to Austin for any occasion.  It was the ""Perfect"" place for my best friends bachelor party bar-none.  Out of every place I've booked using AirBNB... this was by far the best experience I've had.  They have set the bar!!!"
,,,,,,,,Kristen was fantastic. She made the stay very seamless. She constantly went out of her way and checked the mailbox for us since we shipped something to the house for our long weekend. The condo was spacious and perfect for us. We comfortably fit 13 people in the condo for my brothers bachelor party.
,,,,,,,,"Couldn't have asked for a better weekend in Austin for my friend's bachelor party and this condo was a HUGE reason! We had a group of 10 from California experiencing Austin for the first time, and the proximity to liquor stores, amazing food, and countless bars made our trip unforgettable. The hosts greeted us when we arrived with a fully stocked liquor cabinet and plenty of information about the city. Very helpful. I highly recommend this place to any fun group looking for a great weekend getaway. Rooftop is top notch!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was everything we expected, the location was perfect, and the host Kristen was super accommodating and responsive (she even sent cookies and a bottle of scotch our way!).  The house is literally just minutes (walking) from all the action on 6th, and Rainey street is only a short walk from there.  The house accommodated our entire group (18 total).  It was our first time to Austin and we couldn't have asked for more.  Such a fun city and a great place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 117 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Everything was fantastic with the Swanky Townhouse on 6th. The townhouse itself was everything a group of 15 guys could possibly want for a bachelor party. The place is stocked with some booze and food which is a fantastic touch. The roof has a fantastic view of downtown Austin and the walk to wherever you want to go is a quick one. Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Austin with a large group. Dealing with Kristen was a breeze as she and her friends were available for any help or questions we had along the way. A+!
,,,,,,,,"Awesome spot for a large group in Austin. The house is perfect for relaxing in between activities in Austin, many of which are walking distance from the house. Kristen and company were great hosts and they were very responsive to every question we had. I would highly, highly recommend Austin itself, and this house in particular to anyone interested in a large group trip!"
,,,,,,,,"This condo worked out perfectly for our group. The location is great, 6th street is an easy walk, it's in a safe area, and there is a liqour store/gas station within throwing distance. Everything in the pictures is exactly as advertised and the rooftop area alone is worth the rental. The host was extreamly accomodating and always easy to get in touch regarding questions or problems. This townhome is perfect for a large group of people with the lower bunk rooms and more private upstairs bedrooms. The views from the rooftop were incredible and you can see the entire downtown Austin from either the second floor balcony or rooftop. "
,,,,,,,,Amazing house in a great location. Walking distance to everywhere. 15 minutes from airport. Huge rooftop deck was a big selling point. Would rent again!
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was so responsive and easy to work with from day one, providing tons of suggestions on what to do for a large group in Austin. She was extremely accommodating with the check-in time and the changing number of girls in our party. The house was perfect for our large group of 17 and the location is walking distance to some great food trucks and bars on 6th. I would highly recommend this place for a large group weekend getaway!"
,,,,,,,,"This house is awesome and perfect on all levels.  Very unique in layout giving plenty of space and functionality for a large group - I was there with 15 guys.  staying in this house for a bachelor party brought back the good old days of being away at college.  The location is perfect-walking distance from east 6th, west 6th and rainey street - as well as some legit tex mex spots for breakfast.  Kristen is totally cool, helpful and always available without whatever is needed at any time.  This house comes stocked with a full liquor cabinet, food and coffee.  The highlight of the house for sure is the private roofdeck,  Having no one on either side of this spacious deck complete with a beer pong table is the perfect way to spend any afternoon or late night.  This will be where I hope to stay for my next Austin trip."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place to stay in Austin.  On the East side of 6th, and very easy to walk to wherever you want to go.  The condo is perfect for a large group, from the dorm in the basement to the beds upstairs and plenty of bathrooms.  Fantastic rooftop to hang out on during the day and at night.  Kristen is a perfect host, checking in to make sure things are going well and dropping off breakfast tacos in the morning.  If you're going to Austin with a bachelor or bachelorette party, this is an idea choice. "
,,,,,,,,Kristen's apartment is awesome! We had 9 girls staying there for a bachelorette party and we had a blast. The location is perfect for going out on 6th Street and the Rainy District. Awesome food spots and great shopping. Kristen was so helpful and nice! Definitely recommend this spot! 
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place in a fantastic location! Love the nest thermo stat
,,,,,,,,We rented Kristen's house for a bachelor party.  The space and the location were great.  Kristen was very helpful.
,,,,,,,,The house was great for a bachelorette party. We had 15 people and fit perfectly. Kristen was super responsive and available all weekend for anything we needed.
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a GREAT time at Kristen's home. She was very welcoming, accommodating, responsive and the place had everything needed, and it was close to everything! (But not too close ;)  My only wish was that we had better weather so we could have used the rooftop more!  This was really one of my favorite of many Airbnb stays :)"
,,,,,,,,Had an awesome time. Great condo and very gracious hosts. Can't wait till our next visit.
,,,,,,,,"I have nothing but great things to say about our stay at the condo as well as Kristen's hospitality!  We were a bachelorette party of 13 and the house was perfect with plenty of room!  The added bonus was the roof deck with two chair swings, which we made use of several times.  Kristen was extremely helpful leading up to our stay there as well, giving us great restaurant recommendations and things to do!  The neighborhood behind the condo seems to be up-and-coming and has lots of great food trucks and bars...all within walking distance.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was great, very accommodating and flexible. Awesome place and location. Only downside is that most of the beds in the place are pullout couches."
,,,,,,,,"This condo is perfect for a medium to large group, looking to experience the hip Austin restaurant/bar scene. We had a group of 7 guys visiting from all over the country and the place could've accommodated several more.  Awesome location, you can walk to loads of cool bars, restaurants, and food trucks. The roof deck is a highlight. And Kristen and her husband are great hosts.  Highly recommend this place and will definitely book it for our next trip to Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"I would highly recommend this place! It was very nice, spacious, and close to all the action! The host was amazing, very helpful, and even met us with a partying gift!  Thanks! 
"
,,,,,,,,"We rented Swanky Townhome for a friend's bachelor party. The location is fantastic, right on the 6th St strip. Kristen was super friendly and helpful with suggestions of things to do. And, the view of downtown Austin from the roofdeck at night is killer.

p.s. be sure to try the taco truck in the lot across the street."
,,,,,,,,"This house is incredible. We rented it for my brother's bachelor party -- had a large group of guys visiting from all over the country and this place was the perfect Austin headquarters for us. Awesome location, plenty of room for everyone, the roof deck and interior are so (URL HIDDEN) basically a Real World house. 

Kristen and her husband are the coolest -- they were totally accommodating and made us feel right at home. This awesome house played a big role in a very successful bachelor party."
,,,,,,,,"Kristin- Loved the condo.  Fantastic location.  We looked forward to staying there next time we are in Austin.

Thanks"
,,,,,,,,"This place is awesome! Great view and roof deck, plenty of beds for over a dozen bachelor party-goers and you can't beat the location. As one of the other reviewers said, my only concern is that by telling others how great it is I might not be able to rent it again. Kristen was a wonderful host."
,,,,,,,,This place is amazing. Exactly what we were looking for. Close to 6th street and the rooftop area is awesome. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and Kristen was very friendly and easy to deal with. The only downfall was we didnt stay long enough. Would be glad to reccommend this place to others and I know we will be staying there again next time we are in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was fantastic! The perfect stylish urban retreat. It has quick access to all the life of the city on 6th street, and can be a quiet oasis from the outside world when needed. The graffiti in the living room was a nice touch, as was the city skyline and sunset providing an inspiring ambiance in the evening. We used the rooftop deck every night - getting a view of the city at night, and getting a little fresh air before crashing for the night. The apartment was well appointed, with all the tech setup you'd need (Apple TV, Cable, really strong WiFi, etc.).

And we liked how flexible the place was - from handling our small team of 6, to accommodating a party of 25. The place didn't skip a beat!

Next time we're in Austin, we're staying here for sure. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to experience all Austin has to offer from the heart of the action!"
,,,,,,,,"The house is a good house for larger parties, but be aware that a majority of guests sleep in the ""hostel"" room which is basically a converted garage with 5 pullout couches stuffed in the room.  The house also advertises a stocked bar, but we only found almost empty bottles and one wine bottle. The location is easily accessible and within walking distance of many fun areas. On a weekend night the gas station across the street had quite a few sketchy characters hanging around, and felt a little unsafe with a large group of girls in the house."
,,,,,,,,Kristen was great to work with!  We had a great time.  The place is very nice and had plenty of room!
,,,,,,,,What a great experience!  The house is amazing and right in the heart of Austin's action.  The roof deck can't be beat and the rest of the house is perfect for any large group.  Kristen was very responsive and very friendly.  Absolutely recommend to any group.
,,,,,,,,"We could not have asked for a better place to stay in Austin. The condo is AMAZING - it is in a great location, could sleep our group of 11 ladies more than comfortably, and had plenty of space to hang out in during down time. 

Kristen could not have been more accomodating for us - she even stopped by a restaurant to pick up someone's luggage so that she didn't need to bring it out with her. 

If you're looking for a place for a large group within walking distance to downtown, this is it!"
,,,,,,,,"Rent. This. Place. 

That's all I can say about that. Kristen was an extremely gracious host - greeting us at the place, telling us what and what not to do, and even stocking the place with Shiner Bock and other sundry items. It's perfectly situated between East and West 6th street and it has a great roof deck. 

You are not gonna find a better group spot for the money and if I had to do it all again I absolutely word. 

Bravo, Swanky Townhome. Bravo. "
,,,,,,,,"Look at the photos and read the other reviews, this is a fantastic place to stay!! The location is tops for a night out on the town. Close acess to just about everything you would want to do while in Austin. Kristen was easy to work with, and extremely nice in person. Even though we had a large group, everyone had a great place to sleep. We had nice weather and really enjoyed catching some sun on the roof. All around this place cannot be beat. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and very nice house. The hosts really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and even gave us a map of the city. I'd recommend it!
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a fantastic host and was easy to work with. She helped us with dinner/bar recommendations and had the fridge stocked with beer and snacks for our arrival. The townhome is in a great location, right on 6th street and walking distance from all the Austin nightlife. Hands down my favorite part of her place was the private rooftop deck overlooking the city. Kristen's townhome was great for my group of 12 guys, plenty of room for everyone. Would definitely book with Kristen again."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen and her house were amazing. It was in a great location, had plenty of room, and was ideal for our bachelor party. Kristen was incredibly helpful."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen and her husband, Brian, were perfect hosts! They were incredibly accommodating to our large group that was visiting Austin for my friendâ€™s bachelorette party. Whenever we had questions or needed help with anything, they were just a phone call away. The apartment was ideally situated â€“ and allowed us easy access to 6th street and beyond. The roof deck was great for hanging out at night or sunbathing during the day. Would highly recommended this apartment owned by the sweetest couple for any big group travelling to Austin. They showed us some real southern hospitality!"
,,,,,,,,Excellent house. Excellent location. My only fear in giving it a good rating is someone else taking it when I want to rent it again. 
,,,,,,,,"Gorgeous place, amazing roof deck, ideal location to 6th street, incredible host.  Could not have been better for our group of 15 for SXSW."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was the perfect host, and the townhome was perfect for our group. It was big enough to house the whole group comfortably, and the location was great for hitting the town. Not to mention the private roof was a great place hang out.

I would definitely book this townhome again for a large group."
,,,,,,,,Just stayed here this past weekend for my bachelor party. Place was amazing. Great location in between main 6th street and east 6th. Had eleven total guests. Plenty of room for everyone. Would highly recommend this place to any large party heading to Austin for a good time. We had a blast!
,,,,,,,,"Great house! Everything was organized and the host was very kind and available, we were a big group and fitted just fine. Definitely would recommend it!  "
,,,,,,,,"Great space for a big group, fun kitchen, convenient location, nice amenities. Kristen was super helpful with setup and our entertaining needs, went above and beyond with helping with logistics. Top deck area is beautiful with a great view of downtown, perfect for entertaining. The big garage/dormer area worked well for our crew! "
,,,,,,,,"Our group of 15 stayed in Kristen's town house, and it worked out perfectly. The home is large enough to comfortably fit a big group, and is in a great location for walking to restaurants and bars. The beds were comfortable, and Kristen was kind enough to stock the fridge with beer and mimosa makings for our group. This was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had to date. I definitely recommend Kristen's home! Thanks for the hospitality!"
,,,,,,,,"You will have a tough time beating this condo and its owners for any Austin experience.  The central location is one-of-a-kind, the view is extraordinary, and Kristen and Brian go out of their way to make their guests feel welcome.  The place will comfortably accommodate a pretty large group, too.  We will be back without a doubt, and this will be our location of choice."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's town home is awesome, and Kristen is a wonderful hostess!  The place is very fun for a large group.  The location is spectacular--walking distance to tons of great restaurants and bars.  Kristen gave us great recommendations and our group had a wonderful weekend exploring Austin.  She even provided us with snacks and drinks which was a very welcome surprise!  I would recommend this town home to any of my friends and family.  It's great!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was perfect for our group of 8 guys.  It's a short walk to tons of places downtown. We had a great time and Kristen was a great host.  She was very helpful in providing lots of suggestions for things to do and places to eat.
,,,,,,,,We had a bachelor party weekend and Kristen was such a great host. She was very attentive to questions and gave us a ton of great suggestions. Austin is an amazing place to visit and i would recommend staying here if you have a large group. Great outdoor spaces and walking distance to a lot! 
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place was ideal for our group.   Lots of space to hang out, numerous comfortable beds and an incredible roof top deck.  Also, the location is great for downtown - walking distance to everything and very easy to get in and out of.  
Finally, Kristen is an incredibly gracious host.  She went out of her way to accommodate us, including little things from having lots of spare towels to providing wifi and phone chargers.  "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is phenomenal! It's perfect for a small or large group since the place has a lot of flexibility and amenities. It's in a perfect location - close enough to the highway and Downtown Austin (6th street) so getting around isn't an issue at all. Best part about this place - the roof deck! It's a perfect way to start or end any day - beautiful views of Downtown Austin. We highly recommend this place for any sized group, and appreciate the hospitality from Kristen! Thanks again for making our weekend so great. "
,,,,,,,,"Wow, this was the perfect spot for a big group. Even with 13 guys we had plenty of room to stretch out.

The place was spacious and the upstairs patio was incredible. Walking distance to all 6th street has to offer. Kristen even made us fresh guacamole upon arrival and was incredibly hospitable. Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a tremendous, accommodating host. We had a great time staying at her townhome!"
,,,,,,,,"We booked Kristen's townhome for employees in for a company meeting and although I did not stay there, the 7 people that did stay there were very happy.    Everything was clean and prepared and ready.   Kristen is a great hostess and was wonderful to work with.     If you do have a larger crowd, be prepared for more communal sleeping quarters, and if that goes over well with all guests, then this wonderful townhome is perfect.    Thank you Kristen!!!!"
,,,,,,,,"I HIGHLY recommend staying here if it suits your needs. Kristen describes her townhome as ""swanky"" and she does not exaggerate. This swanky townhome is perfectly located just a few short walking minutes to the thick of 6th street. Kristen herself is amazing and made our stay extremely comfortable. If I come to Austin again I know who's door I'm going to knock on!"
,,,,,,,,"Kristen was a wonderful host, and her apartment is really cool. Easy to walk to the action downtown, cool roof deck, plenty of beds. Perfect place for a big group."
,,,,,,,,"10 of us rented this place together for a conference at the Austin Convention Center. The location was great. Kristen was extremely accommodating, and very responsive to all of our queries and needs. 

We ended up having 6 people in the two bedrooms upstairs, and 4 in the garage. The people in the garage had to go upstairs to shower, but it wasn't a problem. The beds were great, even the fold-out ones!  There was plenty of space for all of us to hang out and work. I pretty much finished my dissertation sitting on the recliners there.

The place has a lot of character - fun lighting, electric reclining couches, graffiti art, retro-nouveau furniture. And, despite the week of thunderstorms, we managed to hang out a bit on the roof and the balcony.  The view of the thunderstorms over the city from the balcony was amazing."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Kristen's place.  7 people (everyone in my company) came down for a conference and I wanted a larger place to stay - something more intimate than hotel rooms.  Kristen put out 10 beds for us (some queen sized beds).  Everyone loved the place and much preferred it to hotel rooms.  Kristen was great with communication - as evidenced by the fact that we got there a day before her wedding day, and she was still in touch to check everything was okay with us.  It's a really nice play and I'd definitely recommend staying again."
,,,,,,,,"This is great place in a great location in a great city. Kristen and her husband were incredibly accommodating and helpful in every way. The roof deck is awesome as is the view from the master bedroom. If you are looking for a swanky place with a lot of room in downtown Austin,do not hesitate to rent this couple's beautiful home."
,,,,,,,,"Kristen's place is truly amazing!  It is really spacious - across 3 floors and has 5 beds to sleep on.  The place is perfectly located on 6th street - away from the mayhem but walking distance to it.  There's a lot of great food places nearby, including this taco ruck right opposite.  She had also left towels behind and a detailed list of where to eat / things to do.  In short, really the perfect host. 

The only flip side for us was that 7 of us rented her place, and while 4 people slept in the 2 lovely bedrooms, the other 3 were relegated to the garage converted to a bedroom.  The beds are nice and the garage is super spacious but there's no curtain there so it makes it hard to sleep in.  The place is really ideal for 4 people.  "
,,,,,,,,A stunning place in an amazing location. Kristen is the perfect host. Very thoughtful and communicative. The roof terrace is just the best... 5 stars for that alone!
,,,,,,,,Kristen's place was easily walkable from SXSW events and a great base for us during the event. The large roof deck is a highlight so long as the weather cooperates. 
8327772,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Had a great time and loved this condo. Super clean, easy check-in, central location and easy communication!"
,,,,,,,,Place is perfect!
,,,,,,,,Great Airbnb.  Location was great and the included parking was a huge plus.  Especially since we had to pay to park in most places.
,,,,,,,,"Great place next to Whole Foods and South Lamar. 30 min walk to east 6th or Rainey, cheap rideshare to get anywhere. Very convenient for going out and about downtown area!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place - clean, convenient, and modern. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place in a great location in Austin!  Everything was as described and very clean and comfortable.  I would recommend to anyone and will be looking to stay here again on a future trip to Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Exceptional communication, location and accommodations. Would certainly stay here on subsequent visits. "
,,,,,,,,"Centrally located in a great neighborhood within walking distance of an amazing amount of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc... the apartment itself is very new, clean, and spacious for two people.  We were able to kayak the river, relax in Zilker Park, and even play a round of BYOB mini golf - all within walking distance.  Highly recommend.  Hosts were super responsive and professional.  "
,,,,,,,,Steven's home was perfect.  He was easy to communicate with.  His home was clean and close to a great running and biking trail on the Colorado River.  A short walk to 6th St and great restaurants.  A must stay.
,,,,,,,,Everything was just as described.  I would suggest this to anyone as a great place to call home in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Steven's apartment.  The apartment was very clean and spacious...and the rooftop pool was pretty amazing.

Not only that, the location is perfect.  A pretty quick walk to downtown, Barton Springs and jogging paths along the river.  

Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was perfect. We stayed for the Austin City Limits weekend. The location couldn't have been more central. Easy walk to Zilker and downtown  The building is a brand new development with all the latest amenities. 

The apartment is perfectly laid out well furnished with modern furnishings. Very comfortable.  Fast wifi. Perfect launch pad for the weekend. 

Steven was a fantastic host and easy to contact regarding check in details."
,,,,,,,,"Great communication with Steven leading up to my stay.  The location is perfect for getting in a run and is walkable to the South Congress area.  Restaurants nearby that I'd recommend checking out are 24 diner, True Food and Winflo Osteria (great pizza)."
,,,,,,,,Steven was great host.  No issues across the board.  Would recommend to a friend for sure. 
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I really enjoyed staying at Steven's place. It is in a great location in Austin, walking distance to coffee, restaurants, and groceries. If you want to visit some of Austin's Landmarks (UT Austin, 6th street, the Capitol, South Congress) you are only a 5-10 minute ride away which was excellent. The apartment unit was clean, safe, and comfortable. Steven was very diligent, making sure to provide us with everything we need upon arrival and throughout our stay. His recommended list of restaurants and bars by Austin neighborhoods were especially thoughtful and handy.  "
,,,,,,,,"Steven's listing was everything his description promised. Clean, new, stylish and well-appointed, it couldn't have been in a better location. It was easy to access all parts of Austin from there, and access in and out of the building was equally easy. Dining, shopping and entertainment were all within walking distance if I didn't feel like driving. Steven was available and accommodating in every way both before and during my stay ."
,,,,,,,,My parents came to visit me in Austin and we decided they should stay in an Airbnb opposed to a hotel. It was a great location and Steven made it very easy to get them settled in. There was a manual that had helpful guides to the city and easy directions for the stay. They really loved their first Airbnb experience and it made their visit very enjoyable!
,,,,,,,,"What a Fantastic place, located close to anything you could ever want and just an absolutely great experience and great hosts.  Thanks for everything! "
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in the heart of downtown. Steven was very responsive and a great host. Would recommend highly.
,,,,,,,,Steven's place was a great getaway for us! It was very clean and well appointed and in a fantastic location. Steven was a very responsive host. We would gladly stay there again! 
,,,,,,,,Our stay at Steven's Apartment in Austin was perfect. The place is exactly as advertised and is centrally located. We particularly enjoyed the rooftop pool and gym. The check-in process was really simple and Steven made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was perfectly located, clean, and just a nice place to stay! 0 bad things to say about it, several good things!"
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay at Steven's apartment. The location was perfect to visit Austin (I strongly recommend the BCycle to ride around town, there is a station right in front of the building).
Steven was a great host, very responsive and accommodating with the checkin/checkout time.
The apartment was very clean and super functional. I would definitely come back. Thanks !"
,,,,,,,,Stephen's place was a wonderful little spot in a superb location in Downtown Austin. I recommend.
,,,,,,,,Steven was brilliant as a host!
,,,,,,,,"An amazing location and a really lovely, clean and comfortable apartment. Many thanks Steven, you are a wonderful host. "
,,,,,,,,"Outstanding downtown location near Lady Bird Lake, with a bikeshare station nearby and just a couple blocks to Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. Steven is a great host and the apartment is adorable."
,,,,,,,,"Steven's apartment was exactly what we were looking for and more! It was clean, modern, safe, and everything you need is steps (or a bike ride) away. Trader Joes is super close for groceries. There is a beautiful rooftop terrace, pool, and gym with views of the river and the city. Right out front is a bike station (b-cycle) which was amazing and our main form of transportation around the city on our trip. You can ride over the river to explore beautiful parks, Barton Springs, or the SoCo district, or go the other direction to see the rest of the big city. It's not all walking distance but a bike ride or uber will get you there. We couldn't be more happy with the place, the location, or with Steven's hospitality. He even leaves a detailed catalogue of all the best spots to visit in the city. It was our first time in Austin and we hope to be back and stay again! "
,,,,,,,,"Steven's apartment was amazing!  It was spacious, clean, and modern.  We even enjoyed the rooftop pool and gym with a view!  The building was safe and located in a great part of downtown that was very accessible to Town Lake and a short drive from all destinations that we wanted to check out throughout Austin.  It was also helpful to have a bike-share station right outside the building."
,,,,,,,,"This is a great stay for anyone looking relax off the beaten path, but still be in walking distance to everything.  Super nice place, just steps from Trader Joe's, good food, etc.  Couldn't have asked for a better place to lay my head.  Thanks Steven!"
,,,,,,,,"Steven's place was great!  Absolutely perfect location.  Close to everything Austin has to offer - bars, restaurants, bike trail, etc.  The building's amenities were second to none - the views from the rooftop are spectacular.  "
,,,,,,,,"Nice apartment in the West side of Austin. Very close to the river, downtown, West 6th street, etc. Comfortable sleeper sofa, bedroom does not have a door. It's on the first floor, which is convenient since the back door is on Lamar, but is a little noisy since Lamar is a busy road. The rooftop pool is very nice with a great view. Note: there is a pool attendant, one day we were told to leave since the resident was not with us. Overall a great place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"My wife & I enjoyed Austin and the apartment. It was clean and as described.  Very convenient to the walking/biking trails and to the downtown areas.  We walked everywhere.   

Uber & Lyft departed Austin a week or so before we arrived, however we found local variant ""Get Me"" and it worked fine for longer trips to restaurants etc.

Austin is fabulous."
,,,,,,,,"Excellent location - everything walkable, groceries and bike rental just outside the door. Easy checkin and checkout procedure. Apartment is as described, with nice extras like pool, gym, and even a cinema room in the shared space. Highly recommend it (in particular for the location; that's hard to beat in terms of convenience)"
,,,,,,,,"Steven was very responsive and we enjoyed the location very much. Please be aware that there is no door on the bedroom, and there are windows to the living room, so it's hard for 1 person to be  in the living room and not wake up the person in the bedroom. Also, if you are sensitive to noise, please be aware that the apartment is on the ground level of a bustling road. "
,,,,,,,,The apt was in a great location. It was neat and clean. Steven met us there and gave us all the information we needed to navigate the city. Communication with him was excellent.
,,,,,,,,"Steven was hospitable, professional and accommodating.  This is the second time I've stayed at Stevens place and will do so again in the future.  The place was clean and well located; can't ask for anything more "
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed our stay at Stevens place. The location was absolutely perfect, and most of the places we wanted to go were walkable. The apartment was very comfortable, and the rooftop pool was awesome! I highly recommend this spot."
,,,,,,,,Steven was a fantastic host! He was both helpful and  responsive throughout my stay and went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable. Also the place is fantastic! Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Steven was very communicative and helpful with instructions into how to get into the apartment before and during my stay.
He left a guest manual on the counter which was very helpful.
He was also very accommodating when I said I was arriving an hour earlier than check in and let me check out an hour early.
I appreciated his hospitality.
This is a great little spot if you just want to crash somewhere at the end of the night.
We spent most of our time out on the town despite the rain.
"
,,,,,,,,"Communication with Steven was just as expected.  And, while the directions to the building and instructions for getting the keys seemed confusing they actually were very straightforward.  The apartment was clean and well-maintained and there were no big surprises.  Very quiet for being surrounded by other apartments.  The location was good and there really isn't any place too far away (try the Raddler drink at Liberty Kitchen!).  The apartment was missing some simple staples in the kitchen, but the Whole Foods flagship store is just up Lamar so it's easy to get anything you might need.  Additionally, the living room area is a bit dark and could use the inclusion of a lamp.  All in all, though, it is a nice place and would recommend it for a stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,It's a genuinely lovely place in an incredibly convenient location with super solid wifi. I have zero issues recommending this spot.
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great in the apartment, everything you need, everything worked as it should.  Place was very clean and comfortable, supreme location to everything.  Will totally stay there again next time I'm in Austin.

Only thing to note that I don't remember seeing in the description is that it is a ground floor unit, if that matters to you.  It didn't make any difference to us, just closed blinds when I needed to."
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I had an awesome time staying at Steven's place. It had all the accommodations you would need while staying in Austin. And man, the location...just perfect. Short walk to both the city and the scenic. We will definitely be staying here when we return next year. "
,,,,,,,,"Steven was a fantastic host! Very friendly and helpful. The apt is very neat and clean, great modern decor. The location is perfect. We walked all over downtown as well as along the lake. There is also an awesome pool deck to relax on that has a view of the city to one side and the lake on the other. I would absolutely recommend staying here and hope to again."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Steven's apartment in Austin for two nights.  Here are my positives and negatives about the place / renting from Steven:

Positives:
-Steven was always prompt in getting back to me and very polite
- The place is well stocked, clean, and decorated
- The location is great.  The BEST Whole Foods is just down the (URL HIDDEN) well as the wonderful Waterloo Records / The Book People  A short 15/20 min walk you are to Barton Springs pool

Negatives (these two things keep me from rating this place 5 stars)
- Not very accommodating with check in times.  I was in town at 11.  I shouldn't have to walk around with my luggage for a couple hours to follow a ""standard check in time""   You're renting your own condo, not running a hotel! Why am I paying over 100 dollars a night only to cart my luggage around for a few hours !!  I've had Super 8 Motels be more accommodating. (no joke)  To Steven's credit, he did work it out with his cleaning lady to let me in to drop off my luggage early.  Too bad planning wasn't done ahead to have the cleaning lady there earlier so the whole issue could have been avoided.  

- The insulation of the unit is poor.  The street that the unit is bordering is Lamar which has become a very busy street (Austin has really gotten built up)  If you are a light sleeper, you will not sleep soundly
"
,,,,,,,,"Truly amazing place in Austin to stay in. Everyone we spoke to (locals) said that this location was a great place to stay in.

Steven was prompt in communicating via Airbnb about steps to check in and check out. There were full amenities which we unfortunately did not get to use all of, like a pool and gym. The apartment was very clean, and perfect for a couple looking for a fun long weekend getaway. Near W. 6th bars, the river, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes. Easy to Uber/Lyft everywhere else. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect option for my stay in Austin. Steven was helpful leading up to my stay and communicated throughout my stay, as necessary. The apartment provided everything that I needed and was in a good location - easy access to the lake trail, nice amenities in the building and close to grocery and retail shopping. The walk to downtown was easy and enjoyable too. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is just as advertised. Clean, comfortable, and close to stores and restaurants. The building is upscale and quiet. The river is close by and makes for a scenic walk. Downtown is also walkable. We enjoyed our stay and would certainly return."
,,,,,,,,Steven was great and very responsive! The only thing I regret was not staying here longer. This place is right where you wanta stay to enjoy downtown Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Everything was fantastic.  Perfect location where we could walk to downtown.  No trouble finding parking on the street if you don't want to risk parking in the garage.  The place was clean and really cute.  Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Everything was just as described!
Very clean, awesome pool and gym. 
Perfect spot for an Austin visit. Would definitely return! "
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay in Austin - great downtown location, and easy access to everything I needed. Steven's place was the perfect home away from home during my work trip."
,,,,,,,,We had an awesome experience at Steven's place. The location was so perfect for us and the view from the roof was amazing. The apartment is immaculate and Steven was so quick to respond and answer our questions. We would absolutely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was in a terrific location and just as advertised. Very well decorated and comfortable. Steven was easy to reach for any questions that I had, and the building was very secure. Very close to restaurants, lady bird lake, and Zilker park. We had a terrific time in Austin. Would absolutely stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Steven and Andrew were amazing hosts, extremely communicative and quick to respond. The place was exactly as advertised and we loved it. Will stay when we visit Austin again!"
,,,,,,,,"Steven's home was great! Super clean, well appointed, and in a great location. Steven was responsive to quick one-off questions and a very welcoming host."
,,,,,,,,"Steven is very friendly and responsive. I didn't meet him in person but I still felt like he really wanted me to have a nice stay in his apartment. 

The apartment is close to everything in downtown Austin. Everything is exactly as described. I was in Austin for business and Steven's place was a perfect launchpad for me. "
,,,,,,,,"Steven's place was great! He was super helpful prior to check-in and extremely responsive after check-in. He even created a very informative booklet with local restaurant and entertainment recommendations.

The place itself is great! Very modern, extremely clean and comfortable. 

The apartment is centrally located and we pretty much walked everywhere we went. Also had a few very nice runs out by the lake/river which is just steps away from the apartment. 

The next time I'm in Austin I will definitely stay at Steven's. I highly recommend it."
,,,,,,,,"Steven's place was better than advertised!  It was right in the heart of the restaurant and entertainment district and was an immaculate place to stay.  Steven was courteous and responsive.  I'll stay again!
Roy"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location and very satisfied with accommodations, other than the bed not the most comfortable.  Pictures were consistent with the furnishings when we arrived,and apt nice and clean. Very pleased with the instructions and communication between Steven and myself. Would definitely re-visit."
,,,,,,,,"Nice apartment complex at good downtown location. Had good gym. Apartment had bedroom, bathroom and sitting room / kitchen (with granite counter tops). Had iron which worked well. Didn't use kitchen items nor TV."
,,,,,,,,Steven's place was perfect. Cleaner and more comfortable than a hotel and walking distance to just about everything. His instructions were very clear and his response time was very quick. I would absolutely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"Stevens place is great...clean and amenities for 1-2 people.  perfect location if you want to be steps from the lake, short drive to any part of town.   Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,Good location. Very nice and modern apartment. Steven provided all we needed. I would recommend it!
,,,,,,,,"Stevens apartment is in a new area of Austin near the Power Station and conveniently, near the river path for running or walking.  The apartment is convenient to Trader Joes or walking distance to restaurants and bars.  I didn't use much of what the building had to offer (workout etc) but parking is covered and plentiful, the building is new and very quiet.

The apartment is efficient and worked well for my visit.  There is some road noise from Lamar but I suspect that might be the case anywhere in the city.

Wifi worked great.  Steven was very responsive but in general it was zero dramas!"
,,,,,,,,Great apartment that is located downtown Austin. It was easily accessible with parking - Great for someone with a rental car - Hop onto Mopac or a quick drive over to 35 from apartment. Trader Joes and Whole Foods are a short walk away. Very well lit apartment; consider bringing a sleeping mask as the light fills the bedroom in the AM. Super easy check in and check out. 
,,,,,,,,"Location was great, parking was easy.  Apartment had everything we needed."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great, very clean and nice. It's location was ideal and Steven was a good host. This is a beautiful property with optimal location that fits anyone's needs when staying close to downtown. 

I only had one issue come up, I reported to Steven as soon as i arrived that his bed frame was bent, when I sat my things down I realized it wasnt even so I quickly notified him. It did not hinder my ability to sleep so we were both ok with the situation. 

I would recommend this apartment to my friends and family"
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience! The apartment was great, and the location was even better. You're close to the water and within an easy walk to Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, restaurants, Book People, etc. "
,,,,,,,,They were very accommodating when i had questions. Location is great. 
,,,,,,,,"Steven was super helpful and answered any questions I had right away. The place was clean, convienent, and in a nice location. First time using Airbnb and it was a great experience. "
,,,,,,,,This apartment was very well kept. The photos were very accurate. The one surprise I had was that the apartment was on the first floor so you could hear some street noise. This didn't affect my sleep but this is something light sleepers may want to consider.
,,,,,,,,"A great place, in a great part of the city.  I had an excellent stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is an absolute Gem!  

Easy access to everything by foot (restaurants, park, transportation), and excellent parking  if you drive in to town.

Impeccably clean,  high ceilings, double doors to outside balcony and open floor plan gives the space a roomy feel, despite the single bedroom size.  Full kitchen open to living room keeps things airy, and over-sized bathtub and high-end fixtures throughout speak regal.

The building sports a fantastic rooftop pool with great views of Zilker Park, seating nooks if you seek privacy and adjoining community room with fireplace, flat screens and card tables discretely placed to give the feel  of ""personal"" living space vs. shared accommodation.

Perfect for business trip or pleasure, comfortably fits a single or couple, and an overall great space to use as your hub while in Austin.  Steven & Andrew were perfect hosts,  always reachable but otherwise respectful my privacy.  I'm thoroughly looking forward to returning often.
"
,,,,,,,,Cool apartment in a good location. Steven was a great host and would recommend staying with him if you're looking to visit Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Steven's place was great. Well-located, clean, simple checkin. Steven was prompt responding."
,,,,,,,,"Great location for the price. The roof top pool was excellent. Steven was very quick to answer any emails that I sent.
"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great apartment"
,,,,,,,,Great place.
,,,,,,,,"Steven made me feel extraordinarily welcome in my temporary home of Austin! I would have stayed much longer in this abode if it weren't booked up for the rest of the month due to ACL.

The Wifi was very fast, which I appreciated a lot, and the views of Austin from the roof deck pool and gym were incredible.

Walking distance from Whole Foods, Trader Joes and other awesome places in Austin. 

I highly recommend staying here!"
8356445,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Really well kept home in a great neighborhood and a very accommodating host! Highly recommended if you're planning a stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience staying at this AirBnB. The house was precious and had such a unique and charming historical feel. At the same time, the house had a modern touch. I booked this for a girls weekend for my sisters bachelorette party and it was a perfect fit. The location was perfect and central to everything we needed. I have only been to Austin a handful of times, so this was a great location! We all loved it! It was a very comfortable and homey stay. "
,,,,,,,,"This home is very close to a neighborhood park with swings, slides and lots of room to romp. The nearby Zocalo Cafe was enjoyed by all. The home is well taken care of and Sunee is welcoming and easy to work with."
,,,,,,,,"Sunee is an amazing host. The house was clean and wonderful. The location is great- walking distance to hip restaurants and downtown and still in a quiet neighborhood. The detached ""loveshack"" is surprisingly nice, and feels like a trendy studio apartment. The 6 of us really enjoyed our stay and Sunee is extremely responsive to all our needs. Simply awesome. "
,,,,,,,,We had a group of nine of us for a quick bachelorette weekend. Had a great time and the house fit all of us perfectly in a great location. Sunee was a breeze to work with and super flexible. Highly recommend! 
,,,,,,,,"Sunee was a great host!  There were drinks waiting for us in the fridge and a nice basket of snacks.  The place was clean and in walking distance of many delicious restaurants, a grocery and liquor store.  It's not in the hub of the city but we really liked the location.  We had a great visit!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was absolutely perfect for me and my group of friends. The floor plan is very open and inviting. The beds, pull out couches are very comfortable. The big table in the back was an awesome spot to sit and socialize. There was 10 of us there for the weekend celebrating my Birthday and it did not feel crowded at all. There was plenty space for everyone. The back house is like it's own hotel room. Keyless entry very convenient. The location is prime as well, 6th is walking distance or short cab ride. Theres some good food spots around the neighborhood. I also asked her for a later check out time and she was completely fine with it. Whenever we come back to Austin, and we definitely will. We will absolutely book this place again if it's available "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed here for ACL and truly enjoyed the house. It's close to west 6th and zilker park. Getting in and out of the house was easy for a large group as they have a code (not a key). Allowed us to leave and get back whenever without the worry. There is a main house and a small back house with a little back yard. Lots of space, nice neighborhood and Sunee was very easy to work with. "
,,,,,,,,"Sunee was so wonderful to communicate with and her home was just the most beautiful space for our ACL weekend experience. Perfect location, within walking distance of great food and the festival. The house itself was amazing and Sunee was so helpful and quick to respond. We would 100% stay here again! LOVE! "
,,,,,,,,"Great location and beautiful home with comfortable furniture and beds.  

Sunee was a great host and was an ease to check-in and out.  

The welcome basket was a nice touch and very much appreciated - highly recommend this home for AirBnB trip."
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfect for the group of 8 of us. 4 bedrooms, plenty of living room space, well designed, close to downtown - we loved it. Sunee went above and beyond with snacks and drinks, as well as details of the area and recommendations. Highly recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"Sunee was very communicative and accessible in the entire lead-up to our stay as well as during the stay.  We had a couple of issues with the bathroom and Sunee went out of her way to remedy them as quickly as possible, even sending a friend over while she was out of town for the holiday weekend.  The house is comfortable and charming, and is exactly as advertised."
,,,,,,,,"Sunee was very helpful and welcoming. Her place is adorable and in a wonderful neighborhood that is a convenient walk from cafes, restaurants and sites! Loved it!"
,,,,,,,,Such a great place and conveniently located!! Quiet neighbor. Perfect!!
,,,,,,,,"We loved staying in this cute house! The neighborhood is adorable and close to everything. 

The house was decorated comfortably and super cute. The beds were so comfortable! Only drawback I can think of is the blinds don't completely block the sun in the morning so sleeping in can be tough. Bring an eye mask if you are sensitive! Also if you do have 11 people, the bathroom situation could be tricky. 

Sunee was an amazing host! She was very responsive and accommodating. It was so sweet that she left us snacks and treats in the kitchen! 

I would definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,Absolutely wonderful home! Great location and very spacious!  Perfect place for a girls weekend! Sunee was accessible to help with anything we needed and the snacks were a wonderful touch!
,,,,,,,,"A great place to stay, Sunee is understanding and made the whole process very simple and straight forward. I would highly recommend this place to stay."
,,,,,,,,"I was in Austin celebrating my sister's upcoming wedding. Our group of family and friends loved Sunee's beautiful home. It is conveniently located in the beautiful Clarksville neighborhood within walking distance of everything we could need. The home is very welcoming, clean, well-decorated, and very comfortable. Sunee was helpful, quick to respond, and easy to work with through the entire process. I would definitely stay at Sunee's gorgeous home again and I give it my highest recommendation!"
,,,,,,,,Sunee was was a great host. Available for a call at anytime. 
,,,,,,,,"lovely place, very well kept.  clean, lots of natural light, gorgeous modern furniture, tons of thoughtful extras and conveniences, awesome patio btwn house and in-law unit out back.  k cup machine w/ individual and carafe options, snacks, dish soap, laundry detergent, etc.  we had five women there so we had 3 of us w/ our own bedrooms and 2 sharing the bedrm w/ 2 twins, 4 bedrooms in all (sleeps 11 b/c of many pull outs and queen beds for couples etc).  the main house has only one bathroom but this wasn't a huge issue, for morning showers, half of just went to the in law unit w/ it's separate bathroom/shower.  

cute, quirky neighborhood, felt very safe, walking distance to grocery store and liquor store.  very happy w/ this rental, would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Sunee was awesome. She left some snacks and drinks for us to enjoy and was always reachable when needed. 

The house is beyond beautiful, cozy and comfortable. We loved the house and we were able to fit great.

As amazing the neighborhood is, the neighbors are unreal. We respected the Austin noise ordinance and the rules previously discussed with Sunee, however the neighbors complained for everything and reached out to Sunee making up stories (They had a noise complain at 7pm on a Friday night, when we were outside hanging out and listening to music on a Bluetooth portable speaker).

We loved the house and Sunee's attention, but be careful staying up past 9pm because the neighbors might complain. "
,,,,,,,,"Sunee's place was a quaint spot in a quiet neighborhood in Austin, only a 5 minute drive to downtown. The house slept us all comfortably. She was very accommodating with our check in and check out time. Overall, we were very happy with our time at her property."
,,,,,,,,*This was a business trip* The house was great. Perfect for what we needed. It was clean and roomy. Sunee was very helpful and responsive.
,,,,,,,,"I would 100% recommend staying in this home. Sunee was such a gracious host, very flexible and made the check-in and check-out so easy. The neighborhood and house were even better than we could have imagined. Sunee was also very responsive during our stay if we needed questions answered, etc. Hands down I will suggest this listing to other visitors and would stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Sunee's house is awesome. Clean, comfortable, great for groups and literally ten minutes or less from any place in Austin. She is a marvelous host who makes you feel at home upon arrival, and is attentive and respondent if anything arises. She also stocks a mean fridge :) 

The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, it transports you out of the city with the added benefit of amazing restaurants and coffee shops just a few blocks away. It's a true home away from home."
,,,,,,,,Sunee was the perfect host. She made sure everything was in order before we got there and helped out with questions throughout the trip. I'd definitely stay there again.
,,,,,,,,This was honestly one of my best AirB&B experiences. The house was great. The beds were fantastic as well. Sunee was super responsive and left treats for us which were awesome. She worked with us on the times so we could drop our bags off early and was just a great host overall. Couldn't say enough good things. Thanks. 
,,,,,,,,"The house was great and worked because of the private guest house in the back.  There is one bathroom in the house and one in the guesthouse, but we were six woman and made it work!  Sunee is wonderful, clear communication leading up to rental and house instructions were perfect once there.  Thanks Sunee!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay. Spacious, had all the mod cons that one would need. A lovely common area, a peaceful outside space to enjoy a beer with some friends.
"
,,,,,,,,Our visit the o Austin was a huge success and we had so much fun. Sunee was a great host and made sure everything we needed was taken care of from the very start. I would definitely book with her again.
,,,,,,,,"Four of us, 60+ year-old high school girlfriends, had a wonderful reunion in Austin. It was great to have 4 bedrooms and difficult to decide which was the most cozy. I can second all of the great reviews that Sunee has received. Wonderful kitchen filled with treats for us upon arrival. 
The beds were great and everything extra clean. The backyard is very nice and the neighborhood quiet. When the coffeemaker died, Sunee was there right away and took care of it.  Can't recommend this place highly enough."
,,,,,,,,"We had such a wonderful time at this house.  The owner was super responsive to any questions I had.  The location was in a safe neighborhood but so close to downtown.  We walked to restaurants, a tavern, a grocery, a neighborhood park and the drug store.  I would surely stay here again.  The place was big enough for us to invite family over and have a nice BBQ dinner together.  We also loved her complimentary treats, bagels, coffee, etc.  Wonderful!!! "
,,,,,,,,"This was the nicest airbnb property that I have ever stayed at. The pictures could hardly do it justice. The furniture is all up to date, modern and in great shape. There was plenty of room for my group, and we hard everything we needed.

However... This home is listed as being in a quiet historic neighborhood, and that is also spot on. We quickly learned after one night that the neighbors have zero tolerance for noise. Instead of asking us to keep it down, they instantly called the cops. What a buzzkill. If you are travelling with a large group to Austin to have fun for the weekend, I would say this is not the place for you to stay. If you have a family group, who will not make any noise then this might be the place for you. We kept it down for the remainder of the weekend by staying inside, keeping the radio turned off and keeping our voices down. It wasn't the end of the world, but I wouldn't stay here again."
,,,,,,,,What a great house. Close to everything and really well laid out. Sunee had the house stacked with great Bagels and a fridge full of beverages. Couldnt be happier. 
,,,,,,,,"This may have been the easiest booking/coordinating I've ever done on AirBnB. Sunee  answered my questions when asked (about the area, check-in, check-out) in a very prompt and friendly matter.

The house itself is great - lovely yard with a table for 6 to sit at, open and lit interiors and even a 'snack basket' left for us in the kitchen, which included donuts, plus all the coffee pods we desired. I came with a group of 8 and it was perfect for our stay and a starting point to explore the city.

Neighborhood is great - safe, quiet, within walking distance to a park and the famous Austin graffiti wall and a very short drive to the huge flagship Whole Foods for groceries. Otherwise driving to east Austin restaurants, Rainey St, 6th St, were all about 15 minutes away, very easy to Uber which is what we mostly did. Loved this place and our stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Sunee knows what she is doing! The house was in great condition when I arrived. I had no issue getting into the house and she had EVERYTHING explained on paper so anytime I couldn't find something, I had an answer. The house was PERFECT for the 11 girl weekend trip. I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay at Sunee's immensely!  The house has everything you need, is in a great location, and was super comfortable for our group of 10. We really appreciated the ease of check-in and check-out. Most of all, as the group leader, I very much appreciated how easy Sunee made it to book her place and how quickly she responded to all of my questions and concerns.  I would definitely book with Sunee again. "
,,,,,,,,Great place!  Enjoyed!
,,,,,,,,"It was an amazing experience staying at Sunee's property in Austin. We were there with family and friends the days leading up to our wedding and we loved everything about the house. She had snacks prepared for us and the house was very comfortable. Many of our friends and family said that it felt like home while we stayed there! She even let us stay a little later than the official checkout time to allow our wedding party enough time to get their hair and makeup done.

It was overall an amazing experience and we would not hesitate to stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"This stay far exceeded our family's expectations. Everyone was happy. I was amazed to find a welcome basket plus an amazing assortment of supplies. Checking in was a breeze. We found a booklet describing the house and the neighborhood. We had a sense of being in a home. 

The house is meticulously clean and was outfitted with everything we needed and more.  I described this place to my friends who agreed that we had hit the jackpot with this reservation.  This is the perfect way to enjoy family time away from home. 

I can tell that Sunee is a meticulous, caring and very hard working person. Great job. 

The neighborhood was very quiet. "
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful time in Austin. Four families got together for the first time in 6 years and the house was perfect for all of us. the location was really close to all we wanted to do downtown Austin and for the college. Everything was really close. A wonderful food basket and some drinks in the fridge were great for helping us settle in. Thanks for a wonderful welcome !
,,,,,,,,Very clean and Sunee was super accommodative to our group. She also had a welcome basket and fridge of goodies which was a great way to start a fun weekend in Austin. The location was ideal!
,,,,,,,,"Sunee was great from the initial planning process to check out. She was very quick to respond. She greeted us with some local treats which we snacked on all weekend. The place is exactly like the pictures and descriptions, actually even better. It was very clean and the furnishings were very tasteful. My family and friends were very impressed by how nice it was and the awesome unexpected amenities.  Most of my friends and family have never stayed in an airbnb and were skeptical of me booking it, this rental has totally changed their minds! Overall, great experience and I highly recommend Sunee's home."
,,,,,,,,"We loved this house, location, host, snacks, walkable restaurants, cheap Ã¼bers, close to the river and so much more!! Host let us check in early and stay a little later. Great spot for our girls weekend and we slept 8 people comfortably!! Highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Sunee was wonderful to work with. I had three colleagues in Austin for a week and they loved the home, the location and the very sweet gift that Sunee left for them. I almost took the credit for it. ;)

We will definitely utilize this space for future Austin events."
,,,,,,,,"We had a big group (11 people!) come down for the Austin City Limits music festival, and we all loved the house. Everyone had comfortable sleeping arrangements and getting in and out of the house was a breeze. Also, we were all pleasantly surprised at how well stocked the house was with the essentials - coffee with all the fixings, some snacks, tons of towels, and plenty more. We're thinking about going back down for SXSW and this house is at the top of our list!

As great as the house was, our host Sunee was even better. She was in constant communication with me throughout the entire process, even on short notice (I had previously booked a house and was canceled on 3 weeks before the festival). Any time I wrote Sunee a message, she would get back with me within 2 or 3 hours with the exact info I was looking for. Also, she was incredibly accommodating with our group's needs, and absolutely went above and beyond to make our trip as hassle free as possible. I couldn't have asked for a better host! Thanks Sunee!"
,,,,,,,,"The home was gorgeous, large, spotless, and exactly as it was represented. 

I was able to comfortably fit a group of veterans who came together for our Non-profit event, and it was beyond perfect for what we needed. It even came with a welcome box of goodies for us to snack on. 

"
9755230,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"The place is located near everything you would want to see- downtown, south congress, zilker park, etc... it's a very clean place with lots of space for a couple. I would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,Excellent stay in Austin. The balcony and rooftop bar are amazing. I would stay here again any time. Thanks! 
,,,,,,,,"Thivanka and Monica's home was perfect! It's a very modern building, and between the gated access to the garage, keyed elevators, and the concierge/doorman, we felt very safe. The area itself is nice and safe as well! 

The apartment is really close to Cesar Chavez, which has all kinds of cool cafes and restaurants (and a cate cafe!) so it was the perfect launchpad for our explorations of the city. 

While in the apartment, we were very comfortable; the apartment is very up to date and nice and comfortable. Having an ensuite laundry was great for us, as were the beautiful views. We'd definitely return!"
,,,,,,,,"Very clean, modern, comfortable and centrally located apartment.  Monica was very responsive and made us feel very welcomed.  Only downside was the bar next door had live music until late in the morning.  It was a beautiful place and we really enjoyed our stay."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was beyond awesome. Great location, close to everything.  Prompt communication with Thivanka and Monica. Thank you for an amazing stay"
,,,,,,,,"We love Thivanka's place and would book it again! Check in and check out was easy, T was very responsive to questions, the place was immaculate(I'm 9mo pregnant and slept great on the bed..that's saying something), the amenities were wonderful(great view from the lounge, super relaxing and fun pool, etc), and parking was easy! We felt very welcomed and comfortable! Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Great spot and location.. Just what we were looking for.  thivanka was very accommodating and responsive to any questions we had!  
,,,,,,,,Great experience in a great location. Hosts were so helpful and accomodating. would stay again any time.
,,,,,,,,"We loved the place. Very nice and clean, and at a great price. Only have good things to say about it. "
,,,,,,,,Really beautiful and comfortable apartment in a convenient location! Thivanka was prompt in his communication and there were no issues. 
,,,,,,,,Gorgeous apartment located conveniently right in the heart of downtown. Ample building amenities make the stay more than comfortable.  Thivanka is very communicative and made me feel very welcome in his home. Thank you for an amazing stay - I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a place conveniently located in Downtown Austin. 
14488162,,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great Apartment. Great Location. Great Host. Highly recommend!
11480675,,10,10,10,10,10,10,Nick was such a great host! He pointed me to the best restaurants & coffee shops in the neighborhood. Provided me with routes for navigating the city and gave additional suggestions to make my trip enjoyable beyond what I had planned. Totally would stay & recommend this location!
2467428,4.5,10,10,10,10,9,9,This was a great place in downtown Austin. Communication was fast and the place was great. I couldn't ask for anything more. 
,,,,,,,,Great place. Close to EVERYTHING.
,,,,,,,,Description was accurate. Super convenient location to downtown Austin. I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"This was our first experience using Airbnb and it was great! Smooth process, host was responsive and the apt was just what we had expected. The location was perfect, two blocks from 6th st with all the bars and restaurants, very convenient! Building was good, definitely can tell a lot of people rent these units out, but it was perfect for us. Two minor complaints the couch was not very comfortable to sit on, but the bed was great, and also during our stay they were doing plumbing work and shut our water off for a few hours at a very inconvenient time, but that's not Erica's fault, just annoying. Would definitely recommend this spot though, and would stay here again, if for nothing else than the great location! "
,,,,,,,,"We were felt welcome, received several emails with information and there was quick response to all questions and requests for items after we were in the condo.l  The condo was exactly as described and as seen in the pictures.  The sofa as not that comfortable to sit on and definitely did not make a comfortable bed for 2 adults  We used an air mattress we had  brought and put the sofa-bed mattress on top of it and had a comfortable bed.   We were in the middle of downtown, lots of hotels (charging $30-$40 for parking), restaurants, convention center 1 block away.  Felt very safe walking every where. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was a great find.  It was beautifully furnished and spacious and felt like home, and was only about a 4-minute walk to the convention center.  On weekends the adjacent pool was full of laughing 20-somethings during the day, and the noise made it hard to work in the apartment during the day.  However, there was no noise after 10pm, and there was also no noise on weekdays.  The bed was perhaps the most comfortable be I have ever slept in, and the air conditioning worked well, which was important in the hot and humid weather.  The apartment is an easy walk away from drug stores and small grocery stores, so it was easy to get things I needed or had forgotten to pack.  It seemed like most other apartments in the building might also be airbnb-like apartments for short-term rental."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was clean and spacious, and the complex is conveniently located within downtown without being noisy at night. TurnKey was very easy to deal with over the phone and when there was a problem with another car parked in our spot, they quickly resolved the issue. "
,,,,,,,,"We very much enjoyed our stay at this downtown condo. The location is central to everything, so we were able to walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to go (though it was really nice having a covered parking space when we did need to go somewhere). Check-in was easy, the photos and description matched the listing, and because this is owned by a rental company, I had a number I could reach them at anytime of day if I needed anything. Both the bedroom and living room were spacious, and the queen bed was VERY comfortable. The sofa bed was...about as comfortable as you'd expect for a sofa bed. We brought an air mattress as a backup and ended up using it instead."
,,,,,,,,"Easy check-in, and a great place to stay in Downtown Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"The location for this place can't be beat -- it was a short walk to the convention center (where I needed to go for work) and to an impressive array of snacks and entertainment as well. Management was organized and very responsive (including fielding a late-night request).

The only disappointment was the wifi; the unit appeared to have dedicated internet but most of the time the service was too slow to be useful for much."
,,,,,,,,"This was a great stay. It has a fantastic location in downtown and is a spacious one bedroom. It was incredibly clean, well furnished, very comfortable. Despite being on the second floor it was not noisy. I was there for business and it was a perfect spot. I was sad my circumstances did not allow me the opportunity to stay over and enjoy a weekend as it would have been a lot of fun. I can't imagine returning to one of downtown's hotels as long as this location is available. "
,,,,,,,,"The Airbnb was perfectly located for SXSW and was super convenient.  While the location was great, there were some negatives that were unfortunate in light of the cost.  The apartment was not clean (my guest wore socks inside which were black on the first night from walking around.  The floor was very sticky and the bathroom floor was covered with dust/dirt.  This one bedroom also came with a pull out couch which was extremely uncomfortable for my guest which pretty much resulted in no sleep.  I wouldnâ€™t recommend this in the future.  "
,,,,,,,,"This small condo was perfect for my stay in Austin. I enjoyed having the comforts of home while staying here. The Austin Convention Center is right down the street. Dining and music are all just a quick walk away, too. Thanks for the great stay!"
,,,,,,,,Everything was great! Access and communication was a breeze.  The place was clean and tidy.  
,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy to get in - good communications.  As described.  Location is great - conference 1 block away, favorite jazz place (Elephant room) was two blocks away and 6th Street was two blocks away.  Off street parking for a rental car. Kitchen nicely equipped"
,,,,,,,,"Appartement bien situÃ© et trÃ¨s pratique pour les confÃ©rences car  Ã  deux pas du convention center. Proche de la 6Ã¨me avenue, qui est le quartier des bars de Austin.

Je le recommande fortement."
,,,,,,,,"Didn't get to meet her but everything worked out nicely! Easy to get in, etc"
,,,,,,,,"Great place, close to convention center and downtown hotels.  Seems like lots of other airbnb units in the complex - makes for fun atmosphere."
,,,,,,,,The description of the apartment was accordingly and the apartment was very good. Very recommended!
,,,,,,,,"This small condo was perfect for my stay in Austin. I was in town for a conference, and it did the job perfectly. Amenities were hotel quality, and I really liked having the comforts of home while on a business trip. The location is perfect - the convention center was literally across the street, and shopping, dining and music was all just a quick walk away. Thank you for a great stay!
"
,,,,,,,,Perfect location and very clean rental. Erica was very responsive to all my inquiries and made my stay a breeze. Checking in and checking out was easy.
,,,,,,,,This was a great place to explore Austin! I would definitely go back and stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"This was a great apartment! Very clean, and well stocked. I would say that it fits two people comfortably, not 4, because the pull out couch wasn't very good. The other two people ended up sleeping on an air mattress we brought. Other than that, there were plenty of towels and amenities. Just bring ear plugs for sleeping - the windows are a little thin and sound carries. "
,,,,,,,,"Excellent One bedroom with pullout sofa in the heart of downtown Austin.  Stayed for the 2015 US MotoGP weekend.  It is located on the second floor of a very clean and quiet, three story building and has a dedicated parking space. When you arrive, find a place to park or drop someone off to go up and get the remote for the parking area which is located behind the building.  The building has an entry gate and the condo has a push button lock, and both codes will be provided prior to your arrival. The unit numbering is a bit tricky so a pro tip â€“ use the gate on the east side and the condo is just above the pool. 
The condo is very well kept; everything was clean and in working order. There is a washer/dryer and full kitchen.  Ton of restaurants and nightlife within 2-3 blocks. Royal Blue Grocery is one block south and open from 7am to midnight.  It is boutique, so youâ€™ll pay a bit more but they are a great resource for food, wine, and other items you need. 
I recommend this condo to friends and would stay again while in Austin. 
"
,,,,,,,,"This was the perfect place for my girlfriends and I. The location is fantastic. Super walkable to everything in Austin. The size is great for 3 people but I wouldn't recommend any more than 3. It's a really cute condo and there are lots of friendly neighbors, some residents and other travelers. "
,,,,,,,,The rental went exactly as per communications and per expectations.  Communications were generally efficient except for the details which were informed a little late.  Place was very well kept and clean and well appointed.  More hangers would help.  Happy to rent again here or elsewhere.
,,,,,,,,"The room was just as advertised, which was great.  The team that manages all of this was excellent. My flight was canceled on the day I supposed to check in.  TurnkeyVR helped was able to work with me on making up the lost day even though they have ""strict"" refund/cancellation policies on AirBnB.  Overall positive experience."
,,,,,,,,"There was a problem with my rental before I arrived, but Erica called and let me know. She moved me into another unit in the same building, which was good. The unit was very nicely decorated, modern, and fresh.

I had no issues with door codes, or gate codes. All Erica's communication was great. 

I would recommend this to anyone. "
,,,,,,,,"The price was amazing and the location was absolutely perfect! The little apartment was nicely furnished and cleaned. The sheets were clean and fresh and the towels were too. WiFi was awesome and they had a little Samsung tablet for us to use. The vacation rental service was very attentive to any questions I had.

There were only 3 issues we had with the place. First, the smell. Either the former tenant or the neighbor above/below smokes menthol cigarettes and loves the smell of Freesia. The unit smelled like my grandmother. Second, the email I received with all the rental information listed the wrong parking spot number. Luckily they have a 24/7 phone # and were able to give me the correct information after calling. Lastly, (and we are getting picky now) the latch strike on the door handle needed maintenance so getting into the unit required wiggling and finesse and several tries.

I will definitely recommend them and not hesitate to use the service again the future. "
,,,,,,,,The unit was as described. Very easy going experience. 
15758951,5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Had a great time. Thanks Molly
,,,,,,,,Great place that is perfectly comfortable!
,,,,,,,,We really loved staying here! Very close to downtown and cozy. We felt like it was our own space! Check in was simple and Molly provided recommendations for area attractions. We would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Molly was really kind and responsive to my phone call, as needed. The place is nice and cozy. Nice place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Overall place was great. Molly was amazing - responded fast with any questions, was super accommodating with absolutely everything. She even let us stay past check out time which made for a much nicer trip for us. Molly also left some fruits and snacks for us which was so sweet. Location is THE BEST!. I have visited Austin many times and never stayed at a better location. Its in a quiet area where you can actually walk around and enjoy some greenery but also its only 10-15 min walk from the party on 6th street. I mean amazing! Restaurants are super close by, there was a great coffee/bakery place only 6-7 min walk and clubs only another 10 min walk. I dont think it can get any better if you are coming for a visit to downtown. I also think Rainy street would have been walking distance (30 min or so) but we did no try. Anyway with the no uber situation this place was really a gem. Bed was also pretty comfy. Only couple of things on the more 3-4 star. Place is kind of old.... so I think Molly had it clean and towels and sheets were clean but just because the place was old it made it look not so ""shinny"". Also there was just a bit too much furniture, but honestly if you want to fit 4 people in there its great :) Basically depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for the 5 star roomy, sunny and shinny experience then move on. If you are looking for a place to crash while exploring the city at an AMAZING location and price (seriously amazing price) then this is it. I can guarantee you will enjoy the place and your stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Mollys place is super awesome!
It is very homey. Doesn't even feel like it's mollys place it feels like it's your own! Great location! Great snacks! The projector and laptop are perfect for movie nights and they come in handy. 10/10 alll the way! We love Molly!"
,,,,,,,,"Molly's place is exactly how she described it: Cozy, close to everything, and no frills.  Very easy to communicate with.  Molly even provides blueberry waffles for breakfast (or in my case late night after a long travel day!).  You can't beat how closely located her flat is to everywhere you wan to go in Austin!"
12946025,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,We had a great New Year's trip to Austin and Janet's place helped make it even better. Cute neighborhood and good place for morning runs through the city. Janet made us feel welcome and even left a bottle of bubbly to ring in the new year. Will definitely check out if Janet's place is available first when we return to Austin! 
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at Janet's apartment.  It was super convenient to Downtown and had everything we could have needed.  Janet set up the place with so much thoughtfulness!  It was super clean and cozy. We would definitely stay here again next time we make it out to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my stay! Janet was an extremely attentive and accommodating host. The apt is well outfitted, the bed was very comfortable, and I loved the neighborhood. I highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,I had a terrific stay at Janet's condo.  Her place was exactly as pictured and very convenient to downtown.  I was in Austin for a convention and was able to get to the convention center in under 10 minutes.  Janet was very easy to communicate with and has made sure her condo has every amenity you could possibly need for your stay.  Check-in and check-out were easy.  I would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Janet was an amazing host; easy to communicate with and extra hospitable. I loved her spot in Austin and would definitely stay there again when in town. Such a lovely spot!!
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect sport for a girls weekend. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed (even down to the little toiletries we forgot). If we weren't relaxing by the pool, we were walking downtown to all the restaurants and shops nearby. The apartment is also a quick 10 minute walk from the nearest bike share station and a Whole Foods. 

Janet was a wonderful host and was very responsive to all my questions. If we ever return to Austin, we will definitely stay at here again.  
"
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay at Janet's place! The apartment was just as the pictures and description provided. Janet was friendly and extremely accommodating - meeting us at the apartment upon arrival and even coming back to drop off pool towels for us! Her place was stocked with everything we needed for a weekend away - so thoughtfully organized and perfect for us. The location was in great proximity to points of interest including 6th Street, University of Texas and the neighborhood was quaint with a handful of great restaurants and cafes in walking distance. Everything was perfect and we would absolutely love to stay again! Our AirBnB experience was one of the highlights of our trip! "
,,,,,,,,"We visited Austin for the first time for the ACL. The apartment was in a GREAT location - a charming neighborhood within walking distance to the festival as well as downtown.  It looks just like the photos - really cute and cozy, perfect for one or two people.  It was immaculate and Janet provided such lovely and thoughtful amenities throughout. She is a very helpful and responsive host!"
15194730,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Excellent stay! Very clean, comfortable accommodations, close to many great restaurants and outdoor activities. Loved Austin! Aaron is a very accommodating, pleasant host. Thank you!!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great high design modern guest house in a neighborhood where the houses built are modern Farm style.  Very cool.  Aaron is definitely geared toward attention to detail.  House equipped with everything you could possible want.  High end kitchen and bathroom, nice propane grill if you so desire.  Beds are really comfortable with nice linen, great towels, flowers, etc. Also dog friendly with nice enclosed yard.  We used Austin Ride as Uber and Lyft are not in this town.  Met the most amazing, friendly  people and wait time was no more than 4 minutes.  Never been to Austin and was exactly what I hoped for.  Don't ponder this one book it as it will go fast."
,,,,,,,,"This is the most amazing place!  Clean, Modern, Quiet & Modern!
My husband and I stayed here for 4 days and I didn't want to leave.
Aaron was super helpful getting me in the place and was available for any questions but kept out of the space so it was private for us which is a plus to me.  My friend and her little dog were able to come over and hang out with us. There were dog bowls  and the dog run was pretty neat!
Aaron has great taste!  I loved all the little touches. Cool Austin artwork,
fresh flowers, french press, great glassware - he even had a cool Marshall speaker so we could listen to our own tunes while relaxing in this beautiful space. 
I highly recommend it!!  I can't wait to come back in the spring!"
,,,,,,,,Aaron was a hospitable host and his place was immaculate! We had a great stay in Austin and would definitely recommend the space :)
,,,,,,,,The apartment was just beautiful. Modern and clean. Very private in a great location. We walked to restaurants and bars. We were able to take our dog almost everywhere. It is a very dog friendly place. We only wish we'd scheduled more time in Austin. We will be back!
,,,,,,,,This place is brand new and extremely clean with all of the modern amenities you could ask for! Even though we have a baby that doesn't sleep well we felt very rested due to the extremely comfy beds!! Very central location to all Austin has to offer. Able to walk to several restaurants/coffee shops.  Aaron responded quickly to all of our questions and was super helpful in making sure we saw the best of Austin. He was even willing to purchase a Pack N' Play for us and future guests! 
,,,,,,,,"Aaron's guest house is wonderful and exactly as depicted in the description and pictures. The home is very thoughtfully laid out, with amenities that actually save money, like being dog friendly, having a full kitchen, dishwasher and full size washer/dryer. It has a really high quality grill outside, the interior is tastefully decorated and the beds are comfortable. And the neighborhood is a good location and very walkable. There are some fun restaurants, bars and shops nearby. 

Personally, we are a couple with a toddler and one dog. We were all very comfortable in the home. Aaron welcomed us warmly and was easy to reach via text (my preference) the couple of times we had questions. Overall, a superior rental! We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Austin- though I imagine this lovely spot will be continuously booked solid from here on out! Thank you for your hospitality, Aaron! "
,,,,,,,,"Aaron was a fantastic host, and his arrangement on South Lamar is outstanding! Through out my stay Aaron made sure that I had everything I needed.  He was very helpful and generous.  The spot itself is beautiful, everything is brand new and modern. I kept finding myself saying I wish I lived here.  The neighborhood is very nice, and you are a 5-10 minute ride from downtown Austin.  This trip was by far my best experience with AirBnB.  I highly recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"The guest house was absolutely prefect in every way! Spacious, well-equipped, easy parking, prime location. It's brand new and gorges and of course, very clean.

Aaron was a great communicator both before and throughout our stay and made sure that we were taken care of. He was flexible about us getting a package delivered and for late check out, which was VERY helpful on the day we had to board a plane to London with 8 suitcases, a dog, and a baby. Moving to a different country is stressful to say the least, but it was nice to have a comfortable place to stay."
,,,,,,,,"Aaron was there at the home when we arrived to greet us. He was great and showed us around the property then left to let us get settled in. The property is brand new and located in the rear of the main house. It's very nice, private, and quiet.

The street is quiet, just a short walk or jog down to The river, parks, patios, shops, and restaraunts. Couldn't ask for a better location. Very nice place we will definitely be back! Gourdoughs is awesome food and just a short walk. Browns BBQ is amazing and its right around the corner! "
14806636,,10,10,8,,10,10,"Although our host stated he was out of town on Thanksgiving weekend, he was totally responsive to any text or email.  Access to unit was very easy, location was wonderful and in the heart of it all. Pool area was right off the patio for a nice view.  Kitchen was very well stocked as we fixed a nice Holiday meal for friends. We would return to this great location. "
4814446,5,10,10,10,9,10,9,Pallu was a wonderful and responsive hostess. The house is roomy and great with all the amenities. We were very comfortable. I highly recommend this rental to all y'all out there! 
,,,,,,,,Good communication. Place neat and clean
,,,,,,,,Absolutely fantastic place. Perfect location close to Rainy Street and downtown convention centers. Definitely would stay again.
,,,,,,,,This home is a chic home convenient to Rainey Street. The master bedroom could use blinds or curtains in the upper windows and there is some freeway noise in the master bedroom but the location is great and the home was clean and worked great for our group of six.
,,,,,,,,What a great place to stay in Austin. Walking distance to many bars and restaurants. Simple access to I35. Host was very accommodating. It is a clean and modern two story house. All bedrooms (3) are upstairs. One jack and Jill bath and one master suite. Kitchen is very updated and furnishings are comfy...
,,,,,,,,"This place is amazing and should be on the top of everyone's list of a stay in Austin! The house is adorable and modern with a cute and comfortable decor.  The space is great - the rooms are all large enough for six adults to be comfortable. The house is well stocked with linens and kitchen supplies for a comfortable stay.   The house is located sort-of between East Austin and Rainey Street, both are just a short walk away.  Pallu was a great host, she was communicative before we arrived and during the trip but gave us our space to have a great time. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place, would definitely recommend it."
,,,,,,,,Pallu was great in communicating details for arrival and the place was ready right on time. 
,,,,,,,,"Had a great time staying a Pallu's place! 5 minute walk to Rainey St., which had a grocery store right down the corner but was also quiet enough to not feel like you were in the middle of a crowded city. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,This was an ideal place to stay in Austin. The neighborhood was great - we walked nearly everywhere and the house was convenient in every respect. 
,,,,,,,,It was a great house!  Great location and very clean!
,,,,,,,,"There was a welcome basket waiting for us upon arrival complete with a directory of nearby bars and restaurants. We were in town for ACL and Zilker Park was a quick bike ride on the river away. Rainey Street is about a 4-5 minute walk. Perfect location, great house!"
,,,,,,,,"Pallu is a fantastic host. I've used airbnb several times, and Pallu is by far the best host I've experienced. The house is wonderful and in a great location. Pallu has stocked the house with all the essentials like towels and toiletries. I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,We had a group of girls for a bachelorette party and Pallu's place was fantastic! Everything we needed was provided and she was quick to make sure we were comfortable. Austin was awesome! Definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Pallu had such great communication from the start which was much appreciated. She was very accommodating for check in and check out. The location of the house was perfect, we walked to Rainey street and to get coffee. The house was exactly as pictured, plenty of room for our group and towels galore. "
,,,,,,,,"Hands down the best Airbnb experience. Pallu was super helpful and responsive before and during our stay. I made this stay with 5 of my coworkers for our visit to Texas for our sales trip. We enjoyed two night here and enjoyed the cozy home. It was a perfect space, very clean, comfortable, close to everything.  I would recommend anyone to stay here. Thank you Pallu ! "
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was awesome in getting us all of the information we needed to have a great stay. Everything from the early access information provided to the welcome gift in the living room made the arrival process a breeze. She was very communicative throughout the stay, asking us if we needed any help with any house-related issues. We never had any issue with the house or the neighborhood and it was the key part of an incredible weekend."
,,,,,,,,"The house provided a perfect way to relax in Austin. The neighborhood was quiet, clean, and within walking distance to a few food trucks, restaurants, and a brewery! I was particularly impressed with the master bathroom - it was huge!

We had all the necessities: lots of clean towels, stocked kitchen, and a nice bottle of wine to welcome us to the city. I was also very appreciative of the sunscreen for guests which we used before we went to the lake; it was a very nice touch.  

"
,,,,,,,,This was an overall wonderful experience. Pallu was extremely kind and accommodating. Her place was situated in a great locations. Could not have asked for a better place!
,,,,,,,,"Great house, easy check-in and check out, very nice!"

Great place in a nice neighboorhood.
Walking distance to center (10 mins to Convention Center) and Rainey street.

Everything was clean, the bedrooms offered a lot of space and the kitchen was fully equipped.
Love to come back again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic stay for my group and me. Pallu was very friendly, and made the arrival process super easy. The house is super nice, modern, comfortable, and clean. I was very happy with the whole experience and would absolutely recommend staying with Pallu."
,,,,,,,,Fantastic house. You can't beat this location. Very communicative host. 
,,,,,,,,"Had a terrific stay at her place in Austin. The living space was clean and  comfortable for 6 people. The bathroom and bedrooms were spacious and adequate. The front door has a keypad lock which makes logistics much easier with big groups. 
The highlight is the proximity to Rainey Street with the night life and restaurants. Highly recommend to other travelers. "
,,,,,,,,Pallu was very nice via text message.  Simple and easy.  The way is should be. 
,,,,,,,,The Global Getaway was beautiful and exactly what I was looking for when planning my sister's bachelorette party in Austin! The location was great and easy access to Rainey St. by foot and downtown by cab. Pallu was in contact each day to make sure things were running smoothly and made us all feel very welcome. The lock system at the house is very efficient and so helpful when people are arriving at different times. We will definitely be back!
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I stayed here for a bachelorette celebration. Pallu was very accommodating and easy to communicate with before and during our trip. The house was clean and had all the essential needs available in the kitchen. We have a comfortable, relaxing stay here. It is located just about 15 minutes from the airport and close to Rainey and 6th St if you are looking to go out. There are many restaurants and food trucks available nearby as well. Thanks Pallu!"
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed our stay with Pallu. The location is perfect walking distance to bars but still peaceful and quite. 
,,,,,,,,Pallu was very responsive to our questions prior to our arrival . Her suggestions about restaurants in Rainey Street were a hit with everyone. 
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was an excellent host.  She reached out a few days before we arrived, gave instructions on check-in.  She also offered information about the area, where to eat etc.

The place was exactly as described, bright and new.  And it was in a great area.  A quiet street, but a 5 minute walk to Rainey Street.  We also walked downtown to Congress street and 6th street.

We were 7 people, and fit comfortably.  This was a great place, and Pallu was an excellent host, we absolutely would stay here again if we visit Austin."
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriends and I had the best time in Austin staying at Pallu's!  There was 8 of us and we all slept comfortably, the house was very clean, much bigger in person than in pictures, and is in the perfect location. Pallu was very responsive and accommodating from the moment we booked her home until we checked out. She tracked our flight to ensure we could check in as soon as we landed, stocked the fridge with some treats, and gave us with many amazing recommendations. Next time I'm in Austin, I would definitely stay at Pallu's again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great house for a group with three couples.  Plenty of space to hang out together, three separate bedrooms and three bathrooms.  Nice location in an up and coming area with lits of cute houses and easily walkable to Rainey Street (5-10 min) and the rest of downtown Austin (20 min to 6th).  Also very close to the trails along Lady Bird Lake.  Pallu was very responsive and available prior to and during our stay."
,,,,,,,,"Great house.  Modern, nicely decorated, and clean.  Great location.  Not too far to stumble back from 6th St.  Close to the freeway entrance.  Pallu was very responsive with her communications.  I would definitely try to book again for my next Austin visit.  "
,,,,,,,,"I shared the house with 4 other men. 2 shared the master bedroom (one on the bed and the other on the fold out cushion). 1 person slept in each of the other 2 bedrooms. I slept on the couch.  with 2.5 baths we had no issues at all getting up and out of the house at the same time.
We were in town for a conference at the Hilton which was a quick walk or 5 minute uber ride. We were all happily surprised to see how close we were to Rainey street- easily the best area to eat and drink in ATX.
Pallu is great, she kept me informed on a regular basis. 
We loved it."
,,,,,,,,"This trip was so great! We came here for my sister's bachelorette party and it was pretty perfect. Pallu was so helpful and accommodating. Getting to the house, getting settled and checking out was really easy. Also, there are three beds that are big enough to share and two bathrooms, which makes it ideal for a group of up to 6 people. Definitely spacious and did not feel overcrowded at all.

The house itself is so close to Rainey Street, which is a really fun place to explore on the weekend, and everything else was a super quick Uber ride away.  I highly recommend this place! 

The only complaint we had (and this is so minor): a bunch of girls and no full length mirror! ;) "
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was an amazing. We arrived and there was a nice welcome package for us. Spent a short weekend in Austin for my bachelor party. The house was impeccable, in a great location and was super clean. It was hard to ask for more. I would def repeat when I come back. "
,,,,,,,,"We stayed in Pallu's lovely house for the last weekend of SXSW and could not have had a better time. The location was perfect, allowing us to easily walk to downtown Austin and avoid the awful traffic that gridlocked vehicles for hours. Pallu's house is freshly maintained as if new and the master bedroom is spacious and airy with tons of natural light. Pallu was communicative and frequently checked in via messages, and the welcome snacks and bottle of wine were a sweet gesture of hospitality. And there is free parking! "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time in Austin at Pallu's place. I stayed with a coworker for SxSWedu. Perfect for two coworkers, since there are two ensuite bathrooms. The house is beautiful, well-equipped, clean and in an up-and-coming neighborhood that was only a $5 Uber ride from the Convention Center downtown. It's super close to Rainey Street (we recommend G'raj Mahal!) and a very cute community garden is in walking distance. I don't think I'd want to walk home from downtown by myself late at night under the highway overpass, but that's just common sense. Otherwise, I felt safe in the area. All in all, totally recommend. A great SxSW choice! "
,,,,,,,,I couldn't say enough great things about the place. It was in a perfect location and easy to explore the city. Pallu was very easy to get in touch with and kept in touch throughout the whole trip. Only thing that I would note is that it sleeps 6 comfortable and 2 mattress for people to sleep on the floor. On my next trip to Austin I'd 100% stay here.  
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay in Austin! The space was awesome and it was great to have three bedrooms and three bathrooms available for my group. Pallu was very responsive and made us feel at home. She left us snacks and coffee, some beer, and plenty of towels, blankets, and extra mattresses, making our stay super comfortable. There were also Roku TVs set up and a speaker available, which was great. We had an easy walk to Rainey Street and a bunch of other great restaurants and cafes, and super cheap uber rides to other parts of the city. (We didn't realize until after, but there are also folding chairs and a cooler at the house, in case you decide to wait in the Franklin BBQ line like we did.) I can't recommend this space enough!"
,,,,,,,,Fantastic. Place is beautiful. Great location. Perfect for our large group. 
,,,,,,,,Pallu was great. She was so responsive and helpful and the house was perfect. There were 6 of us for a ladies weekend and we had more than enough room and there was a great living area to hang out in.  Close walk to Rainey Street for great restaurants and bars. 
,,,,,,,,The place was fantastic and Pallu was very responsive and helpful.  The house was well maintained and was even stocked with some basic foods that Pallu welcomed us to eat.  Neighborhood was a little dark but still was safe.  Very accessible to the main parts of the city via Uber or driving.
,,,,,,,,"We very much enjoyed our stay.  The house was very clean and up-to-date.  Pallu was very responsive and great about checking in and making sure everything was okay and made us feel very welcome.  Great ROKU TV too!
"
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was incredibly accommodating and so quick responses. The house was even better than it looks online, it was within walking distance of everything. Couldn't have had a better place for our couples weekend in Austin! Would highly recommend this listing. "
,,,,,,,,The check in process was very simple and easy to follow. The house was as described and we were able to walk to Rainey street and lady bird lake. The washer and dryer was also a nice touch. 5/5 would stay there again!
,,,,,,,,"What a hip, clean place to stay! We were all comfortable and relaxed in this lovely home. Pallu was so sweet to leave us with some welcoming gifts. Such a great host with excellent communication skills (thumbs up all the way)"
,,,,,,,,"This is my second time staying at Pallu's house in East Austin.  It's a great place to stay and has everything that you need.  Also, for those that are runners, you are just a few short blocks from an amazing run around the lake.  Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was very communicative before and during our stay. It was easy to check in late at night, and the place seems brand new and very clean! Short walk to all the great places on Rainey St. We had a fantastic stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This is an excellent place to stay when visiting Austin. Easy access to anywhere, just moments away from downtown or South congress. The house is well maintained, clean, spacious and comfortable. I highly recommend staying at Pallu's and I would stay again when visiting Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We wanted to visit Austin for my 30th birthday and Pallu's house was the perfect spot to stay in. The location was fantastic - a 5-10 minute walk to everything on Rainey Street and a short Uber ride away from 6th Street. The house was also fantastic - it had a very modern look, new appliances, comfy beds, nice bathrooms, etc. - we were very comfortable there. 

Pallu was a great host - she met us at the house and gave us a tour and made sure we had everything we needed. She also left a lovely welcome gift of a six-pack of beer in the fridge for us! She checked in throughout the weekend to make sure everything was going well. I would highly recommend staying at her house and I would definitely stay there again myself! "
,,,,,,,,The property is in a great location and so close to Rainey Street. House itself is just like pictures showed. Pallu was easy to communicate with and we had a great stay. Thanks for a great experience in Austin.

"
,,,,,,,,Great Stay! Awesome location with many local spots within walking distance.
,,,,,,,,"What a great Austin experience!  My friends and I came to Austin for a long weekend to watch the Formula 1 race so we needed something in a great location.  Pallu's house was modern, clean, and beautifully located in East Austin.  Pallu made everything easy on us from Check in to Check out and dropped us a text everyday to make sure we were having a great time.  She's as a nice of a host as you can ever hope to have and her house is awesome.  If you're coming to Austin, this place will definitely not disappoint!  "
,,,,,,,,This was a great location with a very hospitable host. Easy to communicate with and easier check in/out details. Beautiful home that accommodates plenty of folks and we walked in and out of downtown Austin easily. Would definitely recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Enjoyed a wonderful weekend in Austin with my husband and six grown children (two in laws included in that count).  The house was perfect for our group.  Pallu was very easy to work with.  The house was exactly as described.  Situated in a perfect location for our weekend family wedding.  A quick Uber ride to any place downtown. 
Would definitely stay there again.  Thanks for a great weekend!!
Terry 
"
,,,,,,,,"The house is really spacious and spotlessly clean. Master bedroom suite is massive but all bedrooms are good doubles. Lovely open plan lounge, dining and kitchen area makes for good communal atmosphere. Host Pallu is attentive and looks out for you if you need her It's a place you need to have a car as its a bit away from any amenities. Really well positioned for I35 but you do get some freeway noise as a result. Overall it's a really good house with all the things you'd want. My only warning would be that the master bedroom needs more blinds as its too light to sleep in and the lounge area needs an additional blind to have real privacy from the street.  "
,,,,,,,,Nice spot. Fun space. Good location. Easy access and accommodating host. Yay!
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great!!  We were able to walk to breakfast, lunch or dinner or an easy uber ride to shopping etc.  The unit is nicely equipped, clean with cool finishes.  Pallu was so helpful and always available to us.  We will definitely be BACK!!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great location within walking distance of everything we needed. House is beautiful, and came with everything we needed. Very excellent host. We definitely would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at this property while in town for a family wedding. The house is new, clean and ""connected."" It easily accommodated six adults and we enjoyed spending time together in theater open kitchen/living room area. A short walk to Rainey St, Easy to Uber to other spots downtown.  Overall a great property and experience with Pallu!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a terrific time at the Lambie Street house.  It was perfect for our group of 5, close to all, within walking distance of great restaurants and bars!  Pallu was very organized and we had everything we needed for a weekend stay.  I think everyone in our group was ready to move into the house and stay forever!  Thanks Pallu!"
,,,,,,,,Pallu's home was perfect for our family during our wedding in Austin!  Great location near downtown and Rainey Street.  The home is beautiful and slept 7 people comfortably!
,,,,,,,,The house was absolutely perfect for our bachelorette party trip... 8 of us and the house never felt crowded. Pallu is a great host. Very helpful after booking and throughout the stay. Will definitely stay here again if in the area. 
,,,,,,,,"The house was great, as described with plenty of available parking (huge plus in Austin). I had a group of six, everyone loved their rooms. Only drawback is that the master bedroom is extremely bright in the morning, but it helps to get you up an going, so all in all the house was perfect for our group. Extra bonus is they accepted the dogs and the loved having a little side yard. I would definitely recommend and stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"
Pallu made sure that we knew exactly how to access the property and left us a note and book full of information about the area. The home was located wonderfully for getting to the convention center and back. We all agreed that when we come back to Austin we will be staying here again. "
,,,,,,,,Pallu was a great host! She was very responsive to any questions we had and made the experience super easy. The house is in walking distance to lots of things around town and close enough to the interstate to get anywhere in under 15 minutes. We were there celebrating a 30th birthday and the house was perfect to fit all 6 of us.  This was our first time using Airbnb and we will definitely be using it again after this trip! 
,,,,,,,,"Our family of 6 (plus 1 child) loved this airbnb.  Super nice, bright and spacious!  Pallu was willing to meet us as soon as our flight arrived into Austin, which was very convenient. The bedrooms are big enough, and 2.5 bathrooms makes sharing the space easy.  Street parking was a breeze, and the house is conveniently located by the highway and with easy access to all parts of Austin.  Neighborhood is nothing fancy, seems ""up and coming"", but close to LA BBQ and a few other cute spots (Cenote). All in all, great stay and would definitely stay again if we come back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean modern home, good location right by Rainey, convenient to everything else. Also, Pallu was a nice host :). We had an ant issue the second day unfortunately.  Hopefully that gets taken care of. I would stay here again nonetheless. "
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was an incredibly gracious host.  He was very communicative prior to our arrival, making sure everything was to our liking. The house was beautiful and conveniently located with a short walk to Rainey Street.  The beds were very comfortable and the house was well equipped with everything we needed (i.e. wifi, TV, towels, etc.). I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anybody else."
,,,,,,,,Great house. Great host. Highly recommend staying there. Location is ideal. 
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was a gracious hostess.  Before we arrived, she was eager to give us suggestions on fun places to go while we were there. She also met one of us upon our arrival and to give a quick rundown of the space.   

Space: The description of the space was spot on and the pictures advertised were true to the feeling of the home.  With the HOT Austin sun the space was bright, but the AC was sufficient to keep us cooled down when we were ""home."" The only issue our group had was that the master bedroom was a bit too bright in the morning, beyond that the place was perfect. 

As for location, it couldn't have been much better.  We were a 5-10 min walk from Rainey St. which is full of restaurants and bars.  (Clearly, this includes some of Austin's food trucks!)  When we couldn't walk, Uber was a $5-10 ride from everywhere where we wanted to go in town including South Congress. 

I'd definitely stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,She was communicative and made it easy to get in and out without a hitch.  The house was great and the beds were good.  We really enjoyed the house during our stay and would recommend it for people visiting Austin for sure.
,,,,,,,,Pallu was an incredible hostess and the house was absolutely perfect for our stay in Austin!  The house is gorgeous and in a prime location. We were just a short walk to Rainey Street and downtown.  Pallu was in contact with me several times throughout our trip to make sure everything was going okay.  The house was stocked with all the essentials for our stay and she even left a few welcoming goodies for us!  I highly recommend staying here for a visit to Austin.  Can't wait to come back!
,,,,,,,,Pallu is a wonderful host! During our stay she made sure we had everything we needed and checked in daily to see if there was anything else that we needed. Her home and hospitality are wonderful and I would stay at here place again and again. 
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was welcoming, great over the phone and very responsive. The home was lovely and was in a very pleasant location. "
,,,,,,,,Pallu's house is absolutely amazing. It is in the perfect location to explore Austin and especially rainy street. Pallu is an experienced host and I would 100% stay there again!! 
,,,,,,,,"Pallu's house is incredible.  It's clean and very well designed.  The experience went perfectly smooth.  The location is a 2 minute walk from Rainey street, and a 5 minute Uber from anyone else in Austin you would want to go.  We had 3 couples using the 3 rooms, and it was beyond comfortable.  Next week I'm traveling again and paying more for a small hotel than we did for this entire 3 bedroom house.  The price is a steal.  The master shower is amazing.  If you're coming to Austin with a few friends I can't imagine finding a better house to stay in than here."
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was an amazing host! Her home was in the perfect location and she gave great recommendations for things to do and places to see. She made sure we had what we needed for a comfortable stay and was very accommodating for a group of 7. The neighborhood is walking distance to Rainey Street and close to the freeway for a quick drive/uber ride to SoCo or downtown. The house was quiet and cozy, this place really makes you feel at home. I would absolutely recommend this place to my friends and family. 

Thank you, Pallu, for the hospitality. I cannot wait to visit Austin again! "
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was wonderful and made us feel so welcome in her home.  The place was beautiful, clean, well appointed, and very well located.  Walking distance to Rainey street, a short petty cab from 6th, and close to local coffee shops and restaurants.   Pallu's home was decorated very nicely and created a comfortable place for my family to gather.  Pallu was in communication with us before, during, and after our stay to ensure everything went well.  I would highly recommend this property and will rent here again."
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was the perfect host and made us feel at home from the beginning. She left clear instructions for us and was also flexible with check in and check out times. She left a few treats for us as well as a welcome binder which was very helpful.

The house was clean, updated (wood floors/marble finishings), and perfect for 8 girls. There was also a parking spot, fresh towels, clean dishware, etc which allowed us to settle in quickly and make use of all of these amenities. 

The house is a 5 - 10 minute walk to all of the bars on Rainey St. and a 15 minute walk to 6th st. I recommend this house to anybody visiting Austin and/or visiting for a bachelor/bachelorette party. "
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was an exceptional host. She kindly met us at the home as we arrived and was diligent in making sure we were enjoying our stay. The house was very clean, well kept and had lots of open space so it was easy for my group of seven to get comfortable. I offer Pallu the highest marks available and would gladly stay with her again.    "

Location is very close to Rainey St bars & restaurants.
House feels brand new and has cool modern architecture.


"
,,,,,,,,What a great spot! Just spent the weekend here for my brother's bachelor party and can't imagine having stayed anywhere else. A short 5 minute walk to all of the bars on Rainey St. and a 10-15 minute walk to 6th st. The place fit Pallu's description to the tee and was able to accommodate 8 guys with ease. Pallu was a fantastic host. She was at the house waiting for our arrival and did everything she could to ensure we enjoyed our stay. She even went above and beyond helping us ship a large item back to DC after we left. Highly recommend this spot to anybody visiting Austin... Except for when I'm back in town because this is where I'll be staying again! Thanks again Pallu!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic experience!  Pallu was the best host we could have asked for. The check-in/check-out process was super simple and she was immediately accessible for questions, etc. She made us feel very welcome and had great recs for things to do in the area. The house itself is gorgeous and was perfect for our group. We had plenty of space. Rainey Street is a close walk and downtown and the airport are both a quick cab or uber ride.  Wouldn't have changed a thing!  Can't wait to plan a return trip to Austin and stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Pallu was very attentive and helpful before and throughout our stay at her home. She left a very nice care package in the house for when we arrived, which consisted of some snacks and local brew. The location is super close to the Rainey street bars and restaurants whilst being tucked away in a super quiet, residential neighborhood. "
,,,,,,,,"Couldn't have asked for a better house, better location or better host. Pallu went out of her way to accommodate me and my friends during our visit to Austin.

We stayed for SxSW and it was perfect walking distance (d could want. The beds are incredibly comfortable and the shower off the master bath is absolutely huge and luxurious. This was a top notch experience and I will not stay anywhere else on future trips to austin. 
,,,,,,,,"The house was absolutely wonderful and Pallu was a fabulous host. The location is perfect, couple blocks from Rainey street and a quick walk to down town Austin. The house was spotless and spacious. Pallu went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were covered. I highly recommend staying here for your trip to Austin!"

There are 3 bedrooms and the master bedroom was really large and fit an air mattress with space. It was great for our group and the outside area was perfect for our dog. The house is walking distance to Rainey district and short Lyft to 6th street and downtown Austin. Working out the details with Pallu was really easy! I would definitely stay here again! (Already thinking about our next trip) and recommend it to anyone visiting Austin!!

Thanks Pallu!!!!"
15323762,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This was a great place to stay at -- close to everything (South Congress, 6th, Rainey) via walking or a short Fasten ride away. The apartment was great for three people: one for the bed, two in the living room on the couch and air mattress. Stephanie walked us through the complex and gave us a tour of the apartment on our first night -- highly recommended as the hallways can be confusing! She was easily accessible by phone over the weekend. I would definitely stay here again."

Two minutes away from the Hyatt Regency, which is on the river. Across the street from a great coffee shop. She provide parking. Murphy even made a list of her local favorites for us to visit. As a host, she is very reposive to any concern or question you may have. I would definitely go back to this place when I visit Austin again. "
,,,,,,,,Our time was great at the place. It was clean and in an awesome location. The home was nicely cared for and we really enjoyed having coffee on the patio in the mornings. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Murphy's apartment. The location was so excellent and well within walking distance of many of the things we wanted to see and do. Her apartment was cozy and comfortable, and she made us feel welcome with everything from biscotti for coffee to an extra parking pass so we could really feel and live like residents for our stay. :) "
,,,,,,,,"The place was great.  It's my first experience where the owner really does love in the space, so be prepared to live out of your suitcase.  The home is cute and clean.  Coffee press was awesome, and we enjoyed our coffee.  Owner has a pup which means she was fine with us bringing ours!  Also, within walking distance, but bike lanes goes right by apartment - would recommend for getting around."
,,,,,,,,"Murphy was a great host, when completing the process of picking her place i was asked to fill out why i was coming to Austin.  I wrote a few lines that i was going there for my girlfriends birthday with our dog.

Murphy was nice and left us a birthday bag with some treats out. And she left dog bowls for food and water for our dog. 

The apartement itself was very clean and extremeley close to everything. We were able to walk down south congress to homeslice/hopdoddys. 

Would definately come stay again"
,,,,,,,,Amazing stay! Murphy was so responsive and the location was perfect for walking everywhere. Easy check in and out!! Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Murphy's.  Her place is exactly as pictured, super clean, and very close (a few blocks walk) to central downtown locations and neighborhoods.  The apartment is quiet and easily accessible by car from the airport (20 mins).

Murphy is a great host leaving great insider tips and ways to spend your stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Murphy's apartment is perfectly located to explore Austin, walking up South Congress, 1st, to Zilker Park or even downtown is a great way to spend the day. "
,,,,,,,,Murphy was a great host. She was very helpful and friendly.  Her apartment was also great; it was very clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend both her and her apartment. 
,,,,,,,,Great host / property
,,,,,,,,"Stayed during ACL festival weekend 1. Great location - quiet, yet close to good restaurants/shops and Zilker park. Murphy was a great host! Provided delicious food recs and a clean, comfortable and safe place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Murphy left us a helpful note with suggestions on places to try around the area and we checked some of them out which were great! 

The location is wonder and around the places you would want to be when visiting Austin!

We had a great time and she was always quick to respond with any questions we had!"
15352438,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Kelsey's place was great! Super clean, easy flexible check in, and PERFECT location! We did not drive the entire time we were there because most things we wanted to do were in easy walking distance. We used to live in Austin and we love the area just off of west 6th. I would definitely recommend staying here! "
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I come to Austin often, and always use Airbnb. Kelsey's place was our favorite place to stay so far! Excellent location, we were able to walk everywhere, and a very bright, clean, and quiet space! We can't wait to stay again soon! "
,,,,,,,,"The communication with Kelsey leading up to the stay was amazing, and the apartment itself was even better. Great design, use of space, and very clean. I would most definitely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Kelsey's place was a perfect place to stay - it was my first time in Austin and the location was perfect as I could get around mainly on foot.

I loved both the city and the area I was staying in - and communication with Kelsey was perfect."
,,,,,,,,"Hey Everyone! 
This apartment was totally adorable in a great location and very clean.  Kelsey let us drop our bags off a little early which was a huge help and her recommendations for food and whatnot were spot on.  I highly recommend this place to anyone!  "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place to stay! Awesome apartment with cool Marfa touches with a good location. The binder provided with Austin tips and places to check out was very helpful too! Kelsey is a great host, and very responsive to questions. Would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome place! Clean and stylish! Perfect location! 
,,,,,,,,Kelsey truly has brought Marfa to life in this incredibly comfortable and convenient condo. I'll be back for sure ...only after she tells me where she got her sheets and ridiculously comfortable mattress :) five stars all the way!! 
,,,,,,,,We had such a great time in Austin!  The location was perfect--an easy walk to restaurants etc.  The apartment was clean and perfectly decorated!  Kelsey reached out before our stay so we were able to communicate and ask any questions!  We would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Kelsey was amazing host providing us things to do such where to eat, drink, enjoy life, etc.. while in town and was always available to communicate. The place was spotless very clean. My gf is a clean freak and couldn't stop saying how she loved how clean it was.  
Location is awesome centrally located in Austin. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
,,,,,,,,Kelsey's place was super cute and fun. We had a blast exploring the little restaurants nearby. Kelsey was a great communicator and was personable. We wish we could've stayed longer...
,,,,,,,,"Kelsey was a fantastic host. She was responsive all of our questions, gave clear check in instructions and did a great job of making me feel welcomed during my stay. The place was absolutely perfect in every way. Easy off the street parking, Great vibe inside, located near all the attractions  downtown but far enough away for a peaceful night's sleep. I wish I could have stayed a little longer but I look forward so coming back soon!"
,,,,,,,,I love this area of Austin.  This little apartment is perfectly situated and super clean and comfortable.  I appreciate Kelsey's quick response as I was finding last minute accommodations.  The electronic lock makes things very easy.  I loved all the great Austin travel books and recommendation list.  Hoping she adds a microwave for the next time I get to stay here.
,,,,,,,,"Kelsey's place is amazing and comfortable. She provided information for everything, with a list of recommendations for bars, restaurants and things to do. I'd definitely stay in her place again! 

"
,,,,,,,,"Conveniently located, clean, thoughtful amenities, comfortable bed.  Felt like I was at home while on a business trip. 10/10 would stay again. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Kelsey was so sweet and so accommodating. Her home was so inviting and comfortable. The condo is in a great location! She gave us tons of recommendations and had left us a book of restaurants/bars/things to do. Kelsey was the perfect host! 
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic Stay!!  I don't think it could have been any better.  The host is extremely welcoming and it is very clear that she wants her guests to feel at home and have a memorable experience. BTW, the bed was unbelievably comfortable!"
,,,,,,,,"Check in was super easy. Kelsey got me the access code well ahead of my arrival. The decor was perfect. One of the best vacations of my life was in Marfa, TX. It was a nice nostalgic experience and I enjoyed every second of it. Kelsey really knows how to welcome a guest, you have everything you need. Great hostess!"
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had an amazing stay! Kelsey was extremely nice and hospitable. She provided a number of gifts for us (water bottles, brain juice, soda, wine!!!) This was such a perfect location for Austin City Limits. Also, this location is relatively close to the downtown life of Austin (Dirty 6). I highly recommend staying here.

Thanks for a great weekend!"
2502263,4,8,9,8,9,9,8,"Very good location! Easily walkable to downtown and directly behind a coffee shop. Only issue was some odor in the kitchen, and as the house was old the plumbing was quirky."
,,,,,,,,Great first time experience. Everything was very easy and the location was great for a quick vacation in Austin. Thanks again! 
,,,,,,,,"The best thing about this place was the location. There is a really cool cafe next door with cats roaming around inside. There are also plenty of cool bars and restaurants (and food trucks) nearby. Also, the walk to sixth street is not bad at all. There was a small problem with the electricity going out, but it didn't inconvenience us too much at all. "
,,,,,,,,"Some time should be taken on the house before having people stay.  For example,  while sitting on the toilet with the very sparse bit of paper left on a single roll on the silver thing,  water dripped on my head from the leaky ceiling, and the walls were seeping water as well. Someone took a shower in the morning precluding anyone else from using the small,  leaky,  single bathroom. It was very cold."
,,,,,,,,This place is amazing and in a prime position to experience the amazing place that is Austin ! 
,,,,,,,,"This place is more of an unmanned hostel. The rooms have key codes to enter. Three rooms and only one bathroom. The walls are very thin and you can hear everyone entering and exiting the house from the front room where we stayed. Our first night one of the couples sharing the house were extremely loud very late at night. This place would be ideal if you could book with people you know, rather than chance it with strangers. Great location though. "
,,,,,,,,"Place was very nice. Clean, well kept, and in a great location."
,,,,,,,,Great stay as usual! 
,,,,,,,,Was easy to book.
,,,,,,,,"For the location, this is likely the best deal on the market. Since you're sharing with other house guests all the old doors in this house are fitted with coded locks so you don't have to worry about leaving your valuables. Consider that you may be sharing the single bathroom with 4 other guests. Also, there are little to no housewares, I couldn't find a cup or glass to drink water. I also couldn't get the heater to work in the main space (perhaps my own ignorance), but I had a great little room heater that kept me toasty. Just remember, you're getting a fabulous nightly rate. "
,,,,,,,,"Great value for the price. Was travelling on a student budget to a conference and this was a much better deal than a hotel. Stayed Mon - Fri.

Spacious room, comfy full bed, kitchen, living/dining room, and good bathroom. I briefly met the guests in the other 2 rooms, and they were friendly, polite and quiet. Front door and bedroom door both have push-button security locks, so you don't need to pick up or drop off keys. Very convenient! Also, the room has it's own heater and window air conditioner, and I used both during my stay. I did not meet the hosts; everything was automated.

I could have taken the bus to downtown in 3 mins, but I enjoyed the 20 min walk instead.

There's a nice Mexican food truck 1 min West on Cesar Chavez, and an IHOP about 5 mins West of that.
Overall, I recommend it for a cost-effective stay while visiting Austin.

I offered the hosts a few minor suggestions, such as a waste basket, towel hooks, face towels in addition to bath towels, and additional desk surfaces in the bedroom, plus more cups in the kitchen -- Very minor tweeks that would enhance an already good place.
Thanks for a great stay!

,,,,,,,,"It appears that you are going to a house to be met by a couple named Chris & Loni...but really no owners appear throughout the stay. It was essentially a hostel of 4 rooms (1 room being a Caravan on the lot outside the house) in a house but nobody there to greet you and entry and bedroom doors all key pad operated so no keys which questions the security of it all as we don't know how often the PIN codes are changed or have the chance to create our own PIN code. You will have a good stay depending on the other guests in the house as there are house rules but no hosts there to enforce it such as no noise after 11pm or parties from guests...We stayed in bedroom 1 which was closest to the entrance door so each time somebody entered the house in the early morning, we would hear the loud beeping of the key pad entry door and them walking through on the hard wood floors which echoed throughout the small house which disrupted our sleep a lot. Your only contact is with anyone but Chris & Loni as they use a guest service which communicate only using AirBnB message service. They also asked to leave them a 5 star review at the end of our stay. It will be interesting to see how they rate me given we never met anybody. Only non guest that appears in the house once a day is a cleaner. The whole operation is a little deceiving and I would definitely not describe the interior as chic. It was clean but not chic at all. Some people may like it, as a couple we did not. Location was okay."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place in a perfect neighborhood, very close by walk to the night life and a lot of great restaurant. 
Communication is perfect. And the room was very confortable and quiet. "
,,,,,,,,This location was very convenient and the hosts were easy to coordinate with. I would recommend this room to my friends!
,,,,,,,,I enjoyed my stay at Chris and Loni's. I especially appreciated their prompt communication. 
,,,,,,,,Close to la barbecue! Check it out.
,,,,,,,,A work in progress!
,,,,,,,,"A little hard to find the place at night but once you are there, everything works great. Chris is great with communicating promptly. Place is clean and comfortable."
,,,,,,,,Great location within close proximity to the city and plenty of local places to explore!!
,,,,,,,,"I had a place fall through that was a disaster (essentially a youth hostel) and immediately turned back to Chris & Loni (I had stayed there a night the week before, then my family came to town and then I was trying to stay in a different part of town for the experience)... and thankfully they had availability.  

Place is great.  Lock on front door, lock on bedroom door.  Clean. And clean bathroom. It's all I really need. "
,,,,,,,,The room was ok.
,,,,,,,,"Very clean, close to the convention center. "
,,,,,,,,"I highly suggest doing a street view before you book this.  It's defiantly  not peaceful and chic is not the first word that comes to mind about this space.  It seems to be an up and coming neighborhood but as of now it's a little scary.  I was planning to walk downtown with my teenage son but after passing the homeless, a guy with a big yellow sign saying ""AR-7 for $499"", and multiple people begging for money I decided against that. The space was very noisy, after a night at ACL I couldn't hardly sleep because of the traffic and other guest noise.  The inside was not near as nice and new as the pictures let on, it wasn't bad for the price but next time I will just book a hotel to feel safer, have my own bathroom, and secure parking. This was our first Airbnb experience and I must say I'm not impressed.  The hosts weren't communicating directly with me which was fine but I was given very general answers from whatever service they use when I asked about available public transportation near the house.  We ended up driving downtown and paying for parking.  Overall I would say if you can't find anything else and have a pair of earplugs this might not be a bad spot."
,,,,,,,,Clean & comfy room. Sort of felt like a hostel bc the whole house is used for air bnb and all the rooms have keypad locks. 
,,,,,,,,"From the description you might not be aware that this is essentially a hostel with private rooms. They have keypads on the front door and each bedroom door but I wonder how often the codes are changed. While a hostel isn't necessarily bad, you don't get the privacy you get from renting a whole place while also lacking the security you might feel from staying with a host. Kind of a lose lose in my opinion For example I woke up around 2am to get some water only to find someone had left the back door wide open. 

Also the only other negative was the use of a third party for all communications. When you book this place you feel like you're going to be staying with Chris and Loni. In reality you're talking to some person at a call center and Chris and Loni have nothing to do with your stay except accepting your money.

On the positive side this place is in a great location and it was clean. The pictures are accurate and it's a great value. The room you're staying in has a few new features like a nightstand. It's a minimal room but when you're in this area you don't need to be in the room anyways. You need to walk up to East 6th and enjoy some great food and bars. 

Overall this wasn't a bad experience. Just a little different than what I was expecting when I booked. If you're fine with the hostel feel then this is a great bargain and close to some really neat stuff."
,,,,,,,,"Great location. Overall, clean home and rooms. Easy entrance to home. They were able to answer questions and help you on whatever you need!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a nice stay at this airbnb. It was rather an anonymous hostel than an airbnb because no host was there and the front- and roomdoors had  combination locks - what I liked a lot! 
the wifi was good, the room was ok cleana and was a little bit dark and noisy (you could clearly hear people talking in the living room through the wooden walls).
commpunication with the host was good, although unnecessary ;)"
,,,,,,,,Perfect stay. Than you. Very private. Will stay again in near future 
,,,,,,,,"What an awesome stay, the room was quaint and the bed was comfy. I have to say that although it's not a primary residence, I throughly enjoyed getting to know the other guests. Everyone was sweet and kind, it was my own little ""Real World"" moment. Looking forward to staying again. "
,,,,,,,,"I booked this one because of location. Normally I am not picky when travelling alone, but this time I had my fiancÃ© accompanying me. We walked the place and then we literally walked out and got an actual hotel. My fiancÃ© especially and myself did not feel comfortable sleeping here. The main reason was security. The back door did not lock properly, so basically anyone who pushed the back door hard enough can get into the house. We did not like the door codes because we felt like the codes were automated and never changed. We arrived at night after a long day out so we never saw the neighborhood during the day, but we were did not feel like leaving our car overnight in those streets. We only lasted 15 minutes at this place. I wish I could give a better review, but I paid almost $100 and then had to pay for another hotel room. And with that price I could have gotten something way safer even at a motel 6. If you feel adventurous and you are alone without your wife and kids, then go ahead and give this place a try. The only good thing about this is that it is near a bar strip and good nightlife. Sadly, location isn't everything."
,,,,,,,,I was thoroughly disappointed with every aspect of the stay and had to move out to a hotel after the first night. Beer bottles were around the place when I arrived and I was not aware I would be sharing with two young men. Was woken up by the guys bringing home questionable women in the middle of the night. Woke up in the morning to cockroaches crawling across the floor and no toilet paper in the bathroom. Would not recommend to anyone.
,,,,,,,,Great location! Easy to get in and out of. Next to a cat cafe. Walking distance to rainy street and 6th street. Only one bathroom shared with 2 other rooms. But great spot.
,,,,,,,,"While this place was adequate for our stay in Austin, well located, and comfortable (with a nice bed, air conditioning, and good wifi), we did not particularly enjoy this Airbnb experience. When booking you should know that this is not a property that you share with the hosts; instead, this is a three bedroom house + camper trailer in the backyard, all of which are rented by other Airbnb travelers. As a result, the experience feels a bit more like staying in a hostel than staying in a home. At the busiest of times, ten people will be sharing one bathroom. Furthermore, it felt a bit strange to not know who we were sharing the space with. I would imagine that for some people none of this would be a problem but having travelled extensively with Airbnb I can say that this was my least satisfying experience yet, as I've come to really enjoy the ""home-y"" atmosphere of other listings."
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood was wonderful. The listing was accurate and we were just so excited about its location easy to access amenities and backyard porch swing. 
,,,,,,,,"Yes, communication/instructions were very good, thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"This is perfect for a short layover. It was a good location - not in the middle of everything but close enough - and the whole place was clean and well-decorated. That said, the doors have key-code locks, but the outside door still seemed like it should be more secure. There were also no extra amenities - just two towels, have to pay for bottled water, etc. - so go in expecting the basics. "
,,,,,,,,Great location!  Very close to downtown Austin.  The room was very comfortable and checking in/checking out was very easy.  
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood and location was great! We enjoyed staying so close to everything. The hosts were very good about keeping us informed.
,,,,,,,,"It's a nice place to stay and meet new friend, especially close to downtown area for a leisure walk to several spotlights. Will stay again in the future."
,,,,,,,,great stay! everything was really nice and clean. super close to the city and safe/quiet!
,,,,,,,,I had a good experience staying here. The bed is comfortable. The location is great. Super close to downtown. This room is right at the front of the house so you can hear people talking in the living area in the morning. But other than that I enjoyed my stay. I would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,I had an enjoyable stay in Room 1. The apartment was neat and true to the pictures. It's not a fancy place but great for the price. The other guests in the house were quiet and respectful. Chris & Loni were responsive and accommodating. The location was excellent - just a short walk to downtown and the bars on Rainey Street. I would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Great experience! Nice neighborhood and location! Charming house. Was skeptical bc of some of some of the reviews below, but those problems were not present with us when we stayed. Definitely will stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean and perfect for what we needed during our trip. Close to downtown, perfect for where we wanted to visit."
,,,,,,,,"Painless, arrive any time house and room. Very affordable. Cate cafe next door where you can pet cats and eat vegan food. 

Somewhat dirty, dusty in some areas. Sheets may not be fully deodorized. Bathroom sink was a little gross. Drilling outside the bedroom window before checkout time :( 

Great choice for the price and lack of hassle."
,,,,,,,,Had everything I needed and a comfortable bed. Good location to walk to convention center or downtown restaurants. The only complaint I have was about the loud air conditioner that woke me up several times over the course of my stay.
,,,,,,,,"Great experience. Very helpful and understanding host's. 
Great communication the whole time.
The place is very nice and comfortable with great local food."
,,,,,,,,"Very efficient process- in and out, no problem. Close to downtown area! I had a great stay! "
,,,,,,,,This place needs to be bleached. There is dirt everywhere. The photos are not accurate. It's run like a hostel without the benefits. You'll be staying with strangers and using a dirty shower. The price seems too good because it is. I'm rather appalled that the rating is still high after the repeated negative reviews.
,,,,,,,,Loved this place it's very quiet and is a $6 cab ride from here to 6 street also close to great coffee shops and food will stay Again!
,,,,,,,,"The location is great if you don't have a car, the neighbourhood is generally safe even if there are a lot of boarded-up houses, and the responses to queries by text or mail are fast and polite BUT the house in itself, and the little that is provided, is very, very basic with need of renovations (holes in the walls where the switches are set, very loud air conditioning system in the bedroom, and so on). One positive thing was the bed was comfortable. But it is not, as promoted, CHIC at all and the photos on the site are misleading. What's more the cleaning had not been done in my bedroom: there was dried mud with dead maggots, bits of plastic refuse and so on all over the floor: not a pleasant welcome! Considering all of this, the price is steep for what you get in the house, not to mention the strict cancelling condition.  What is sold here is the location not the quality or ""chic"" of the accommodation, and they  seem to have quite a profitable business going with this house (3 bedrooms and a trailer, with one bathroom only with no air conditioning in it) and at least another house in the same neighbourhood... "
,,,,,,,,"I would not recommend staying at this location. The shower did not work for the entirety of the stay. I was informed that the shower would be fixed during the time I was staying. It was not. The hosts informed me that I should walk to another location to shower. That being said, this was my first time in Austin and I did not sign up to walk around an unfamiliar area to find a shower. The front door also had about a two inch gap at the bottom which allowed for bugs to easily get into the house. For my next trip, I will pay more for better accommodations that actually work, and more responsible hosts. "
,,,,,,,,Wonderful stay. Very convenient location. Easy in and out with coded doorknob. 
,,,,,,,,"It was nice, nothing special. We needed a place to stay close to Convention Center and for that reason it was perfect only like 15min walking. "
,,,,,,,,"Fairly bare-bones experience, but clean and generally well-maintained.  The air conditioning and wifi worked well.  The messages from Chris and Loni were helpful.  I felt that I knew who to contact if I needed anything.   Overall a good option for travellers on a budget. "
,,,,,,,,This is right next to Austin's cat cafe (nice surprise) and is in a cool area! The home was welcoming and comfortable.
,,,,,,,,"The place is perfect to get in and out.  It's set up very comfortably, even though you're sharing the house with two other roommates.  Within walking (or stumbling!) distance to downtown.  "
,,,,,,,,The house was in a perfect location! Very convenient walk to everywhere we wanted to be. The house is quaint but clean. It was great for what we needed which was a safe place to sleep. Communication prior to arrival was perfect as well! Thank you.
,,,,,,,,"Great AirBnB experience. No frills place, perfect for my time in Austin. Convenient location in an up and coming neighborhood. Walking distance to many key places in town and a short cab ride to airport. If you're just after a place to keep your belongings secure and sleep of a night, I highly recommend this property."
,,,,,,,,"I attended a conference at the convention center, and basically just needed a cheap place to sleep for 4 days. The bed was comfortable and the house and room were clean. The shower was adequate. The house and room had AC. The wifi was reliable. The other folks staying there were nice and considerate; I think I saw them once. This is a great accommodation for the price, but it is very bare bones. I walked to the convention center one day, but used car service apps the rest of the time. It was about $5 per trip to and from the convention center and downtown around Congress St from this house. The kitchen had a few basics, including a stove, microwave, coffee maker, and some pots and pans. Overall, great experience and I'd recommend this to anyone else on a tight budget."
,,,,,,,,"Place was exactly as advertised - we spent a very comfortable night here, and the neighborhood is absolutely stuffed with great bars and restaurants; there's definitely a fun and vibrant night scene evolving in the vicinity. Would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Unfortunately the room description and photos mislead us a bit. The bed, airco, towels and the place in general where not that luxurious as made come across. Also did we find some other people's hairs in the bed sheets and some stains, which unfortunately could not be replaced by new sheets. The advert should state more clearly that this is more like a ""unmanned Hostel"" instead of a ""bed and breakfast"". Also was communication with the host delegated to a third party, which we could not reach by phone. Luckily the area itself did improve the experience a bit."
,,,,,,,,"We had a blast staying here- great location, clean comfortable home, and our hosts were welcoming and easy to reach if needed. Would definitely stay there again next time in Austin ."
,,,,,,,,"Decent apartment.  Clean, good price, relatively close to downtown.  A bit bare-bones but has most of the necessities."
,,,,,,,,This spot was exactly as advertised. Super seamless communication on Julia's behalf and a really easy in and out process. The house was located in a really easy spot as far as activities and navigation go.
,,,,,,,,"This was one of my worst Airbnb experiences. The flat is managed not by ""Julia"" but by a company. When I arrived the room wasn't clean and I had to wait until past 6 pm to be able to get into the room, which still didn't feel very clean. On the positive side, the location is great, and I guess I can't complain much for the price I paid for the location.
"
,,,,,,,,"We had an excellent time in Austin! Although we only stayed at Julia's place for one night- we really enjoyed our experience. The house is cute and very welcoming. We, unfortunately, had to request a late check-out, but she was more than accommodating. We would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting the area!"
,,,,,,,,The place was really convenient and parking was easy to find. I will definitely consider staying here again!
,,,,,,,,PERFECT location. Right next to some of my favorite Austin establishments. Clean and quiet.
,,,,,,,,Very convenient easy to find location. Great for exploring east Dallas. I was very pleasantly surprised to find Texas's only cat cafe right beside the house. It was  a good find considering what I wanted and was my first air bnb experience.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect little place! Clean, walking distance to down town and everything we needed for our short stay. Nothing fancy, but just the right price. Highly recommend this place if you're on a budget and looking for a place close to a lot of cool sights in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Neighborhood felt a bit sketchy, but after a few days you find all these hidden gems. Good food trucks nearby and a nice brunch place. Also close enough to take a run through the boardwalk. Pleasantly surprised in a good way!"
,,,,,,,,My friend and I stayed here for a night. Everything in our room was clean and well kept. The bathroom and common areas were also in excellent condition. 
,,,,,,,,Great cozy house close to downtown! Very convenient and comfortable. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"Nice an easy to deal with, just as described and close to the city her info book was great too"
,,,,,,,,"Very good experience.   Quick instant booking.  Received the house and room codes in seconds, drove there, and found my room with no problems.  Clean house.  Adjacent to a very walkable street with plenty of eating and drinking options."
,,,,,,,,"I stayed for 4 nights here.  Everyone was nice in communications.  The wifi worked very well, and I appreciated use of the kitchen with stove and refrigerator.  Rooms had an electric space heater, which is needed in cold seasons.

There were problems, however.  The place was rather decrepit, and it would be easy for someone to break in.  When I arrived, the bedsheets were dirty and someone had to come over in the late evening to replace them, which was very nice (though it wouldn't have been necessary if the sheets had been clean).  I repeatedly requested all-cotton sheets, but they were never brought over for me.  It is very strange that anyone hosting people would use synthetic instead of cotton sheets on the beds.  The old bathroom sink and old bathtub were not clean, and the tub had a crack in the old fiberglass, so there is probably rot in/under the floor.  An incompetent repair had been attempted with what looked like caulking, but it was not sealed.  The bathroom had no fan ventilation, and the window did not provide adequate ventilation.  The kitchen table was very unstable, and it was the only place to sit and eat or write something or use a laptop.  There was almost nothing in the rooms other than the bed."
,,,,,,,,"To be honest, we were pretty underwhelmed. The location is decent, but the property itself wasn't what we had hoped.

Pros:
- The automatic door code system is great. Wish more people did this.
- Our host (and/or the Guesty concierge service they use) are quick to answer any messages.
- Walking distance to a lot of great stuff.

Cons:
- The ""secure"" front door to the house stopped working half way through our stay - letting anyone into the house without the code! I informed our host of this and was told it would be fixed the next morning, but 3 days later it was still broken.
- The house itself is pretty shabby. The wall in the room has big chunks of plaster missing around the fixtures. The sheets looked dirty when we checked in, and the bathroom was pretty grim.

It's clear that this property is basically an ""airbnb hostel"" where the minimum amount of money has been spent to make rooms livable. For about the same price, you can get a motel with a furnished room, clean sheets, and basic maintenance â€” we'll probably do that next time."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location! A very sweet hostel style location with convenient access to wonderful Austin highlights including a cat cafe literally steps away from your front door! Loved this stay
,,,,,,,,"We arrived at Julia's airbnb only after leaving another airbnb that was not up to parr. While Julia's place was central to where we wanted to be, it was more of a hostel- The sheets were dirty,  the floor was dirty,  and as a couple we had only ONE towel to share for showers- for 3 days which was awful.  Drying with a wet towel sucks. There was rarely a time when we didn't have to wait in line For the bathroom, even just for a quick visit.  Six (or 8 if. The owner is utilizing The airstream outside on the driveway) adults in a three bedroom, one bath house just doesn't work. To boot, there were giant cockroaches, and more than just a couple so we had to find a way to keep all of our stuff up off the dirty floors. I would not recommend this place. As our first airbnb experience, both that we tried were absolutely awful.  We will stick to hotels for our future trips. I'd rather pays bit more and have basic amenities. "
,,,,,,,,"This was a decent airbnb. The door codes were convenient, the room was spacious enough, and the place was clean. It's a little far walking to downtown, but I guess you know that getting into it. Being right next to a cat cafe and taco stand is definitely a plus! On the downside, the bathroom had multiple issues -- window pane falling off, cracked tub, and slow drain. But to the hosts' credit, they sent a repairman to address some of these issues a few days into my stay. (Though they could have been more communicative after I sent them a message about these issues -- never received a response). On the whole, a good experience. "
,,,,,,,,"The house was as described. When I've got there, I had a problem with the code, sent a message but never got any answer, just the automated emails .. Luckily there was a guy inside who let me in. Besides that everything ok. "
,,,,,,,,"Habitacion privada con baÃ±o y cocina compartida con otras 2 habitaciones. En ningun momento vimos al propietario, al llegar la puerta dispone de un codigo para entrar. Tuvimos un problema con la puerta y tardaron 2 dias en solucionarlo, mientras tanto no pudimos cerrar la puerta.
No recomendable."
,,,,,,,,"The place was fine and location is the greatest. The bed was very comfy but the sheets and pillow cases not so clean. And I didnt like that much that the place is kind of a hostal, not someones house. You can tell it the minute you get there. On the good side, they answer very fast and allow me to leave my luggage at the living room after checking out. "
,,,,,,,,"Easy to find, access, and use. Juila's place was as described, a small house east of downtown. House was quiet, and room was ready as advertized."
,,,,,,,,"The place was awesome!!! Extremely clean, comfy bed and clean towels. Might have been nice to have a hand towel and hand soap in the bathroom, but other than that no complaints! Perfect location, would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was as advertised. However, I'm allergic to pet dander and ended up getting an allergy attack about an hour into my stay. I had not made it clear that I expected the location to be free of pets, so the mistake was my own. My girlfriend and I simply left the house and got a hotel room in order to avoid aggravating my allergies. There was no issue with Julia or the hosts, just a matter of personal preference."
,,,,,,,,"The room and house were exactly as described and I was very pleased with its condition, and the location was excellent with a lot of things within walking distance and easy access to the highways but the location itself is quiet and a great place to unwind. Also, free wifi!

My only complaint (and reason I won't give this 5 stars) is that the room codes appear to be somewhat predictable as I had my door opened by other guests twice while I was sleeping during my week there. The front door to the house was never a concern though. I'm hoping they look into making the codes a bit more random and less predictable per room."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, within easy walking distance of vibrant 6th Street. Having the door access codes in advance made it simple to arrive and get settled. Nice and quiet house and safe neighbourhood. Only downside was that the bathroom was a little dirty and the provided towels were also a bit grubby/dated but overall fine for one night/the price."
,,,,,,,,"Nice and comfortable room, good neighborhood, next to Blue Cat Cafe! Patient and helpful when I had any problem needs solving."
,,,,,,,,"The house was very clean. I felt very safe and the keyless doors were very convenient. There wasn't much in the immediate neighborhood, but it was just a few blocks from the 6th street neighborhood, which is filled with shops and restaurants. It was right on the 17 bus line to take you to the city."
,,,,,,,,"My stay at Julia's was exactly as it is listed- peaceful! The house is located just East of downtown, within walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, bookstores,  and Rainey Street (although you do have to walk through the crowded I-35 intersection). The room was spacious and clean. Julia is very easy to communicate with and made booking very easy. I would highly recommend staying here, and will definitely book with Julia on my next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying here, was within walking distance from everything and was super easy! Wished it had shampoo/soap in the bathroom as noted, but it was easy to find at the store nearby. The door code made it super easy to get in and out, and they were super communicative throughout the week. "
,,,,,,,,"Very welcoming, and really nice host! Instructions to get in/out were very clear and the home was clean and cozy. Really close to Downtown- easy to get anywhere! "
,,,,,,,,"Cute spot, great location! "
,,,,,,,,Great location convenient to downtown and the airport.  Ease your mind as this was an easy door to open that led to other doors.  A nice place to hang your hat and maybe meet a few other visitors at the same time.  The bed was quite comfortable.  I would recommend this place for a night or two.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location for Austin.  Always nice to come home to peace and quiet.  Always love Julia's set-ups.  Wish there were some in LA!  Good internet, house is a little old and run down and a little close to a major street."
,,,,,,,,"This is the perfect crash-pad for downtown Austin. I had a conference at the 4 seasons and I was less than a mile away! Very eclectic, up and coming neighborhood. If you want a place where you can hang out in comfort maybe keep looking but if you are going to spend your days exploring Austin and want to be CLOSE, you found the spot!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a wonderful stay in a super cool neighborhood!  Walking distance to Texas Coffee Traders, and biking distance to downtown and South Congress shopping and entertainment!  The experience was great as an almost hotel style, fairly private stay.  I'm sure it depends on the visitors coming in, whether it becomes a more social scene, but either way, the rooms are private enough to consider your own interests.  It was very easy to get in, and there was fluid contact with Julia the whole time.  I recommend taking a stroll through the community garden at Festival Beach, just a short, 10 minute walk from your stay - what a great city!  Thanks Julia, for an open door, and a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"I only needed a room for one night so I could catch an early flight back to Virginia. This room was very affordable, the whole house was nicely kept and clean, and the location was convenient too. Close to fun stuff in east austin and not too far from the other neighborhoods. The property managers made checking in and out super easy and got back to me very quickly when i had a question. All in all a very positive experience!"
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I had the most pleasant time staying at Julias! The place is lovely - charming and includes pretty much anything you could need. Getting all settled in was easy as could be.  She has a book on the table that has some great recommendations for places nearby and things to do which was so helpful for us.

"
,,,,,,,,"Listing description is very accurate and the entire process was smooth. The access codes to the doors are super convenient and give you the flexibility of a late arrival without disturbing anyone. 

The place is cozy, clean and very convenient - it's less than a mile from Rainey Street and close to the restaurants. 

The place is also very clean and I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to spend time in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,Good staying there
,,,,,,,,"Julia was a great host, though I didn't meet her. She kept in contact and would check in with me during my stay. I loved the house, it was exactly how it was described. The room I stayed in was bigger than expected, and the pictures didn't show it's closet space. There were some small toiletries in case visitors didn't have any, which I was thankful for.  The house has bare essentials, so if you're looking for a more homie stay, this isn't it. But it's a great place if you want to be close to bars/restaurants and want a convenience factor. I stayed here because of work, and it was close to my office with minimal traffic. Also, there was ample parking. Next time I'm in Austin, I will definitely stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay. House is in a fun part of Austin. Outside of downtown but close to a lot of great places to eat and drink. I would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"The Julia apartment was very confortable,
I cooked just like at home. Through an email, Julia sent me the password of the home, so that I entered easily the house. The house is really close from downtown ( close for a european guy !). Thank you Julia."
,,,,,,,,"This place was fantastic. The facilities were excellent, It is very close to downtown. It is very close walking distance to the historic Rainey and 6th street areas, Plenty of great TexMex foodvan options nearby also. An added bonus is that is so close  Ladybird Lake which is a must while in town! The hosts were also extremely helpful and accommodating. "
,,,,,,,,"Super clean, accessible space to come and go through in an interesting location. Having stayed in many hostels I would definitely call it a step up and while it doesn't give ou the feeling of staying in someone's home, something can be sort of nice about that. "
,,,,,,,,"I am from Austin TX originally. I came back after spending years away, to catch up with the Austin scene. Julia's place is perfectly situated in close proximity to most all major downtown attractions - all within walking/biking distance. The home was quaint, clean, quiet, safe, and affordably priced. Julia is a perfectly gracious host with open lines of communication before/during/after the stay. I recommend, and I hope to return soon for another visit! Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place if you want your own space and quiet. Its not the homey vibe of other Airbnb's where you interact with the hosts, but it can be nice if you just want time to yourself. Awesome location, close to some great cafes, restaurants and food trucks!

"
,,,,,,,,The place was small but in the heart of downtown and served our needs perfectly.  
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Julia's was good. It was clean, comfortable, a great location, good value, and easy to access using the immediate booking and entry codes. Other airbnbers there were friendly too. If you're looking for a homey feel, however, we wouldn't really recommend this place. We thought it was more of a place to just sleep, there isn't much space in the living room to sit and relax, and it feels a bit like a college dorm. Would be worth spending a bit more on a different spot if you're looking for a cozy home with locals to talk to."
,,,,,,,,"The room is very nice, and the house was very clean. It's a nice place to stay for one night, but I don't know if I would stay longer, mostly because there's only one bathroom to share with all other guests in the house. The code to the front door didn't work when I arrived, and I waited about 45 minutes to get a response from someone with a new code so I could get in, which was frustrating. The person who finally responded was really friendly, and after that everything was fine.  Like I said, I'd recommend this place to stay for a night or two, if you don't mind sharing a bathroom."
,,,,,,,,"Great neighborhood within walking distance to at least one fantastic cafÃ©, and Rainey Blvd for night time activity.  Place is simple and no thrills, just what I needed for a one-night stay!  Bed was comfortable and the place was air conditioned.   Downside is that it operates more like a hostel -- I was fortunate to be the only one there.  May have been strange if other two rooms had been occupied, but that also depends on personal preference.    "
,,,,,,,,Fantastic location! Easy to walk or ride to most of the fantastic spots in Austin. It was easy to check in and out of this location. Also got some great recommendations on where to eat/catch live music. Overall it was a great stay!
,,,,,,,,"Great place, easy walking distance from downtown or a cheap $5 uber ride. As you can see from the other reviews it's more like a managed B&B than anyone's house.  But that worked great for me. Chris, the guy who would come in the late mornings and make sure the place was clean etc. was such a great guy! Super helpful and good company! It was nice to meet a few other travellers as well. Overall it was perfect for a weekend in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,The place was clean and the bed was comfortable. It was exactly what we needed for the night. The whole process was very easy.
,,,,,,,,"Clean, quiet, secure house!  Exactly what I needed and the location was awesome!"
,,,,,,,,"Someone was there to welcome me and show me around briefly, they told me all about what to do in the area and what's around.
The room was immaculately clean, the sheets felt so beautiful and fresh, the bed was beyond comfortable and the pillows were lovely.

The house was very clean, kitchen had anything you need. All in all it was a great price, the room was a nice big size and I had a lovely stay. GREAT location too!"
,,,,,,,,I loved my stay at Julia's! I was first in the downtown hostel which was very cramped and stuffy and and I reached out to Julia and she was very responsive. She helped me upgrade my room and was quick to reply every time. I didn't meet Julia in person but I did meet her assistant Sara who was very kind and helpful. The place is simple but is perfect for being close to 6th street and downtown. There are also fun bars and restaurants near by. The Bed was amazing and this was perfect for my situation. Thanks Julia!
,,,,,,,,"There are three rooms and one bathroom. The host does not live on site. As other reviewers have said, it's basically a hostel, but even hostels have someone on site to make sure everything is okay. We had an issue with our code not working on our assigned room, but it did work on the room next to it. I got a call back about 15 minutes later from the host to resolve the issue, but it really made me feel uncomfortable at the thought of someone else having a code for our room."
,,,,,,,,"We were meet by Sarah, a friend of Julie's. She was very friendly and helpful. A great neighbourhood to be staying in."
,,,,,,,,"It was my first experience to stay in a place with Airbnb, i spent two nights during the weekend "
,,,,,,,,Everything was just as expected during our stay. The room was clean & the location was perfect. Julia was able to get us in immediately with only a few minutes notice. Overall we were pleased with our stay.
,,,,,,,,"Julia was super quick to respond to my request and sent me all the information I needed.  The place was easy to find and i was able to park right in front of the property.  The whole place was really clean and although I never used it the kitchen look half decent and there was also a kitchen table and a small sofa in the communal area.  The bathroom although a little dated was clean, lock on the door, plenty of toilet roll and most importantly had a hot and powerful shower.  My room was a decent size with a really comfortable double bed.  There was an air con machine which was a life saver for me and looked like a fan heater.  The location was great, felt safe and maybe a 20 min walk in to the heart of Austin with plenty to see along the way. Close enough to walk, far enough away to be quiet.  There are 3 bedrooms and an airstream but unfortunately I only got to meet a couple of others just as I was leaving.  As a lone traveller I would have welcomed a beer buddy.  Overall I was really impressed with Julia and her place.  I recommend staying here and will certainly look to stay here when I visit Austin again :-) 
Kai"
,,,,,,,,"This is mostly just an expensive hostel. There are three rooms, each with a key pad lock. We chatted a bit with the other guests but aside from that there was no real sense of home or community. Also, on our second day we received a flyer from an activist group stating that these types of Air BnB houses are not actually legal. They claimed that Julia is working for a larger corporation that buys houses and remodels them to become Air Bnb houses, and since the owner doesn't live in the home, that's illegal. They also argued that the neighborhood is suffering because of it, and that old buildings and businesses are being torn down to build similar housing setups to this one. I'm personally inclined to believe their arguments, as I saw that Julia manages a bunch of different houses throughout the city, All in the same impersonal, business-oriented stay. We booked really last minute so we didn't have much choice, but in the future I won't stay in one of her rooms again. 

As for the house and the room itself, the room fine. The location is awesome and the room was clean, albeit with some strange, sparse decor. When we first got in the room smelled pretty strongly of feet and we eventually figured out that the sheets were really stinky of mildew. We got in touch with Julia and her friend Sara came over and gave us new ones. We also ran out of toilet paper and the bathroom was pretty dirty. Nothing was done about that during the two nights that I stayed there. All in all, they were responsive to our needs but it was a very sterile experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic spot in a great location in Austin!  We walked to Rainey St., the White horse and other cool places.  The bed was super comfortable and the house was very neat and clean.  I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks Julia!"
,,,,,,,,Clean and comfortable! Exactly what we needed for our time in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, super comfy bed! All in all, a great first AirBnB experience for me! "
,,,,,,,,Place was pretty expensive for what it was. Was pretty clean and basic. Location was within walking distance of sixth. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place and value, simple and easy and right by downtown."
,,,,,,,,"My brother and I found it very easy to book the room here. WiFi was reliable and location to downtown was key. Overall though, the house itself is just ok. A little damp in the AM. Pretty basic with a small couch to chill at apt. A little bit pricey for what it is: a place to shower and sleep. Not sure I would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"What a great location, perfect for getting to explore downtown Austin without paying exorbitant hotel prices. A nice quite neighborhood close to all the happening locations. The house was decorated very well and also very well maintained. Thanks so much for making your house available! I'd highly recommend it to anyone coming to visit the area."
,,,,,,,,"Although Julia wasnt there to welcome me in, I was able to get in fine and felt somewhat safe, even sleeping there as a woman. You get what you pay for, rooms are relatively clean, bathroom not so much and have to share, but acceptable. Cool coffee shop around the corner, Flat Track i think "
,,,,,,,,"This is a super gr8 location! Perfect fit for our needs. The option to store luggage after checkout, was an added bonus. Thank you, Julia!"
,,,,,,,,"This little house was an easy overnight. Easy to find, easy to park and very tidy! Access was granted through key pads, one for the house and one for the room. I was able to find some eats and drinks within walking distance that were commendable and then settle in for a good night's sleep in the quiet little house. The room was a bit chilly and a midnight mishap where someone accessed my private room detracted from my overall rating. The management was baffled about how anyone had my code. No harm, but I might have been concerned had my stay lasted any longer.  "
,,,,,,,,"The location was perfect for us (we love hanging out in East Austin and the place is walkable to our favorite haunts).  The house and room were clean, the bed was comfortable.  You should know two things about the place:  1) there is one bathroom for three rooms and an Airstream so there can be quite a wait (particularly for showers as checkout time approaches); 2) there is little to no insulation so if you are there on a cold night (as we were) you will be COLD.  We were prepared for the first issue but not the second.  The space heater helped but I was literally shivering under all the covers, after we left the heater on high for 4 hours while we went out for dinner and drinks.  By then it was after 1 AM and there wasn't much that could be done other than shiver.  We left it on all night (despite the noise it made) and the room only got to 64 degrees by morning.  In the spring or the fall, this would probably be a great place to stay but I can't give it a good review (despite the great location and other good features) because we both slept poorly due to the cold and noise from the heater.  And that's the main reason you book a room... to sleep."
,,,,,,,,"Good location because you can do almost everything by walk and the district is full of nice place for visiting, eating and drinking. 

The sheet and the room was clean. You can use free kitchen. 

But the bathroom wasn't very clean. 

And we never meet Julia....But she gave us all information what we needed by phone.

This place looks like more an hostel. So just a spot to crash, not for meeting real people."
,,,,,,,,Me and my friend had an amazing stay at Julia's. Perfect location and good neighbourhood. Recommend this to anyone going to Austin. Thanks Julia!!! :)
,,,,,,,,"Did not meet Julia, but instructions were clear on how to access house and room within.  Sara, who manages house was helpful and friendly.  House was in line with what previous reviewers have said, so pretty much on par with the expectations (think hostel vs bed and breakfast or hotel).  Neighborhood has many delicious food trucks and location is close to East 6th with many bars and live music.  
This house in particular does not have central air so it was a bit damp and caused some breathing issues for my friend at night (I was fine, but just a heads up).  Because there was another booking after we arrived we actually relocated to a room in another house nearby (San Marcos Street) also managed by Julia/Sara which did have central air and was more comfortable for us both.  That said, there was no hot water (bursts of warm water while showering) although they were aware of this issue and working on it so it might be resolved by now.  
Overall, thanks to a strong wifi connection, I could message Julia/Sara with any needs we had and they were quick to respond as well as very flexible in terms of check-out times and long-term stay rates.  I would recommend staying here if you just need a place to crash and want to be close to the ""scene"" and lots of two-stepping! "
,,,,,,,,"Very 'Austin' feel to the whole place. It wasn't the most luxurious place I have ever stayed, but I chose it for its value, as well as its location. Keep in mind there are multiple rooms that are all rented separately on here, so keep that in mind. Definitely has a 'hostel' vibe. When I went to sleep it was just me in the house and when I woke up there was a guy and his sister from Croatia on the couch. I love a good adventure!"
,,,,,,,,"It was really pleasant stay and would definitely recommend it. Julia is great and flexible host, reacting prompt to any question via sms or phone â€“ with great recommendations for easier transport and Austin highlights. The location is great for this price range - 10-15 min walk to the Downtown and in the pleasant area; The minor problem, which was absolutely not caused or could have been prevented by the host, was handled extremely professionally and promptly â€“ even above expectations.

"
,,,,,,,,Julia was super accommodating of my last minute same day check in. The house was exactly as described and there were helpful hints for exploring Austin in a binder which I found very useful. The location was great for walking to downtown too. Definitely recommend. 
,,,,,,,,Staying at Julia's was great! The check in and check out was very convenient and her cute home is only about a 10min walk into downtown. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Great location and comfortable house. Very satisfied :)
,,,,,,,,Very comfy house close to the city! Convenient and reasonably priced. The did however create the impression that the house would be for ourselves - which was not the case.  But still a great Gem near the city centre
,,,,,,,,"I stayed one night at Julia's. I got there late but was pleased to see that she had snacks and wine or beer to drink. Unfortunately, there was no wine opener. Still, the pretzels were appreciated. The room was beautiful. I had to hunt for a clean towel though, which I found. One person showed up and made coffee. Which I appreciated a lot. I would have liked it if the bathroom had been cleaner. Otherwise the neighborhood was cool and the bus stop right across the street. I only wish I had had more time to enjoy that part of Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Simple, well-kept, older house right off of a main street in a semi sketchy-looking neighborhood, but no issues at all. Some homeless people are around, as in every major city. I think that's just how residential Austin looks. The nearby food trucks look similar, but have great reviews and the $1.50taco one is good!  I actually met a handful of people staying at neighboring Airbnbs walking around going to the same festival I was attending. The one house mate was one of them, so it worked out great to make a friend during my first Airbnb experience especially since I traveled solo!  It was easier & cheaper to not have a car, so I walked and only explored the downtown area (15min max to the convention center & Rainey Street), spending minimal time in the house. Sara was hospitable and informative, provided a space heater, & even allowed me to leave a few hours after check out, which was a huge help! Average-sized room with a closet, hangers, a small side table, full-length mirror, and towels. The bed was comfy, but the linens smelled like it was sitting in the washer for too long. The bathroom was clean and random toiletries were provided, like you're at a friend's place. The tub was squeaky, like I was going to break it by stepping on certain spots. I didn't really use the kitchen, but it was clean. No paper towels though. I felt safe with the keypad locked room, however the room is located next to the front door, so you will clearly hear when people walk in and out at all hours. I think it was a bit pricey for what it is overall, but there were 2 festivals going on that weekend. Good house and room for those who will be out all day/night enjoying Austin, only needing a place to sleep. It was a different yet positive first experience."
,,,,,,,,Julia was very responsive. House was cute with easy check in. Very close to the food and fun the Austin is notorious for. Great stay! Thanks Julia! 
,,,,,,,,It was Okay
,,,,,,,,"The room was clean, the bed was super comfy, and we were able to come and go as we pleased. Great location in East Austin. And the parking was a major plus!"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at the location for about 5 days because I was attending a film festival. The neighborhood is very quiet and close to the downtown area of the festival. I saw lots of food trucks in the neighborhood and I could walk to the iHop for a late night meal. 

The bed is soft and the room is very warm. It comes with a blanket and two towels. The common area is nice, with beer in the fridge and wine available to purchase. The common area is also well air conditioned and very clean. 

When I had a problem with the lock, the owner came and helped me get back into my room. It's a great place to stay at a very affordable price. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything worked out well. I never met the host but was given a code to the door. Everything was as expected. It's pretty basic but clean and ready to go. The house had several rooms rented out and isn't super sound proof so noise was a little bit of and issue, but nothing crazy."
,,,,,,,,"A really lovely, simple space. The location was awesome, and it had a really nice friendly feel to it. Julia was responsive to our needs and the booking process was easy. Hassle free. I liked the ""keyless"" concept - one less thing to think about. I'd recommend Julia's space to my friends, and I'd go again!"
,,,,,,,,"Great, cosy, easy place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,Nice place. Spacious and clean. Easy to get to. About 20mins walk from downtown or 5min bus journey. Had a good experience.
,,,,,,,,"I was very impressed. Firstly by the speed, attitude, and relevance of Julia's communications - never had such prompt feedback on airbnb before! Secondly by the accommodation and location. Room was spacious, clean and  comfortable with good AC, common area was well laid out, all directions clear - and a fridge fully stocked with goodies (for a donation of course). The location is excellent. felt very safe, tons of free parking, and a few minutes to downtown. Julia will be my first call next time I need to stay over in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The booking was quick and simple. Julie and Sarah were very responsive and our room was all it was promised to be, save for the color of the walls. Expectations were clear and met and we enjoyed having a place walkable to downtown."
,,,,,,,,"We were welcomed when we got to the place. Then pretty much left alone for the rest of the weekend. It was really easy getting to/from Downtown, Soco, and all of the other Austin hotspots."
,,,,,,,,"Here are a couple things about the house...
1.  there was a 1"" gap from floor to door slab letting in the bugs and misquotes. 
2.  There were specs and some kind of dirt on the sheets. 
3.  There was no way to take a shower and be assured no one would walk in as the door didn't have a working lock. 
4.  there was significant traffic in the middle of the night including loud banging and doors shutting loudly.  It was at least for an hour and a half and included the three o'clock hour.

All in all, the conditions were unclean, awkward, unsafe and did not allow for any way to rest or feel as if it was OK to leave the room except if necessary, even to use the kitchen or bathroom.
"
,,,,,,,,Cute little house convenient to downtown.  The bus stop is right on the corner.  Clean and tidy.  Free wifi.  Bathroom is shared with several other rooms and it is small.   Each bedroom has a lock with a passcode.  Never met the hostess but she responded to my communications timely.  
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,julia's place was well priced...communication was fantastic!  If your lookin for a bare-boned room at a fair price...Julia's place works. The location is not what I would consider downtown but it is a short bus ride { the #17 }. Room was clean and bed was satisfactory. Would recommend Julia's place if ya just need a room and little else at a good price. Jim
,,,,,,,,"found myself in a bind and julia really saved the day! turnkey booking, super responsive, friendly and flexible. cute and tidy home, in an unbeatable location!"
,,,,,,,,Was given the access codes.  There was a load music well into the morning. Had to ask for another towel.
,,,,,,,,"Julia was a great host! I stayed in both the Airstream trailer and one of the rooms in the house. The house is very comfortable and well air-conditioned. The room was simple but well decorated. Most importantly, the house is in a great location, within walking distance of downtown and the hike and bike trail. Definitely a great value!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place for the money. Julia is on-point with communication and the place is very clean and comfortable. Pros are ease of access, price, bedroom size and bed comfort. The ONLY con was the A/C in the bedroom. It was 99 degrees and the AC from the common space didn't circulate well into the bedroom so I woke up a bit hot. That is my nitpick though (its late august so it was pretty toasty outside). For one night it worked out very nicely for me and is a steal for the area. I thought it wasn't that close to the 6th st area bars Touristy bars (30+ min walk), but its a better location to the higher end clubs-part of 6th and RAINEY ST! Rainey St was amazing. Will definitely stay here again. Thanks Julia!"
,,,,,,,,"Wonderful host. The setup is just brilliant and very slick. 
Some nice bonus treats in the fridge too :)"
,,,,,,,,"I did not personally meet the host but she was very helpful. Room just as described, basic and clean.  Great location!"
,,,,,,,,"Julia's place is located in a great area, close to downtown Austin and in a quiet neighbourhood. I did not meet her personally, but she was extremely nice on the phone and everything was ready when I got in to her place. My room (No. 1) was nice and spacious, and very clean. The kitchen is fully functional and with 2 other rooms plus the RV outside you get to meet  the orher people who are staying there. All in all a great place in Austin."
,,,,,,,,My best friend and I stayed one night at Juliet's B&B. We stayed in room #1. The room was spacious and the bed very comfortable. Juliet's B&B is also very well located and easy to park if you have a car.
,,,,,,,,The room and location were stellar. There are so many nearby spots -- La Barbecue makes some insanely good bbq. The accommodations were clean and quiet.  Juliet's response time is as advertised.  There's no reason not to stay here. I plan to do it again.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time staying at the BnB! The place was clean and comfortable and well-kept and Juliet was very friendly and accommodating. The location was great too; we were able to walk to several dinner locations, some really cool night life, and stopped by the Wright brother's Brew and Brew every morning for coffee and every night for some good beers. We got to know some of the other guests staying at the house too, which was nice. The neighborhood is quiet but has good night life not too far. We were really happy with our stay and will definitely try to stop over again next time we are in Austin. Thanks Juliet for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Cute place walking distance to everything, clean and responsive host! Very simple but great for the price. You probably will be sharing the apartment with other travelers. "
,,,,,,,,"Oh fairest Juliet!

This was my first time using this side of Air Bnb... And what a wonderful place to stay it was. Juliet was extremely fast to respond to my initial and subsequent questions about the house, she provided a directions to, instructions and recommendations about the property, the surrounding areas and everything in between. 

And!!!! she did it all with a sweet and calm voice that sounded genuinely interested and invested in her guests. She is a WINNER!

So the house is very cute. 3 bedrooms for rent, with a nice set up of brand new sheets, comforters, towels and huge comfortable beds. The kitchen is available to cook / or drink as if you were in your own house. 

Free WIFI !

I didn't get to see the inside of the trailer, but it added a very cool touch to the whole set up.

All in all I had a fantastic time in Austin and it was 100 percent due to where I stayed and the people I met while I was there. 

So here is to Juliet ! My first Air BnB host. Ill never forget you.


"
,,,,,,,,"Juliet was super nice and very eager to share travel tips and recommendations! The home was in walking distance to many great bars and restaurants, and wasn't too far from downtown. We didnt realize when booking that the house would be shared ONLY by other airbnb'ers, but it ended up having a casual, hostel-like vibe and felt rather private. "
,,,,,,,,Really great neighborhood & location--walkable & great food around the area. Juliet was great & followed up super quick with any questions. Really lovely other people staying in nearby spaces that turned into quick friends. Thanks for awesome stay! We will be back!
,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my time in the Novasota house! It was clean and had great amenities. Even though I was unable to meet up with Juliet, she was very accommodating and prompt in responding to any questions I had via text/email. This was my first airbnb experience and I can honestly say it was wonderful! The house was conveniently located, 20 minute walk to downtown, very comfortable full size bed and a clean bathroom and kitchen area. Will definitely look to book with Juliet again if I am lucky enough to come back to wonderful Austin in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying with Jordan was adequate for the SXSW festival. It's a low budget option, run as a business. "
1148536,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"We enjoyed our stay at Amit's place. It's modern, comfortable and well appointed. The number of liquor bottles on display and beer mugs in the cabinets imply that it's normally quite a party house, but our family still felt at home. The location is great, quite close to the river and Rainey St. Our only quibble was with the third 'bedroom' which is actually just a part of the hallway with a screen separating it and a queen bed in it -- which doesn't afford much privacy. If that's not an issue for you, we'd recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,Gorgeous and so comfy!!!
,,,,,,,,"Conveniently located just outside downtown, with good access to freeways and lots to do.  Home was very comfortable with a great backyard, and plenty of amenities inside the home for day to day living.  Only disappointment was that the home was not a full 3 bedroom as the third bed was in an open den area, without a door. Overall, worked out great."
,,,,,,,,"Great house, close to Austin hot spots. Host was very knowledgeable and quick to response. Would definitely recommend "
,,,,,,,,"The house was just pictured. It was a great home base for my friend's bachelorette weekend! It's very close to Rainey street and just a short ride away from 6th street, Franklin BBQ, the flagship Whole Foods, etc. Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"A couple of colleagues and I stayed at Amit's home in East Austin. We all loved it! Really comfortable, beautifully designed and centrally located. Close to all the best food trucks and coffee shops, and only a mile from downtown. Strongly recommend for anyone visiting Austin!"
,,,,,,,,We very much enjoyed our stay at Amit's house close to Rainey St.! Such a fun backyard with cornhole and a hammock. We would totally stay here again!
,,,,,,,,The place was better than expected in a great neighborhood.  No complaints!  
,,,,,,,,"Amit was an informative and accommodating host -- a pleasure to deal with and quick to respond to any queries. The place was exactly as pictured in the photos. It was extremely comfortable with heaps of amenities. And the neighborhood is fantastic, centrally located to so many great parts of Austin. I would recommend this spot without hesitation."
,,,,,,,,"To be honest the ladies who stayed there and I were absolutely delighted with the place. Amit has a truly splendid home and a lot of his character is present throughout the home. The place is very Austiny! He was so hospitable and we were truly delighted with the place. Zero complaints! Very happy with our choice. Thank you so much, Amit! We hope to be back soon!"
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay at Amit's place in Austin! We had 6 ladies and there was plenty of room for all of us to sleep comfortably and to get ready in the bathrooms. The location is awesome - a few blocks from Rainey street! We also loved the backyard and the spacious kitchen. Amit was a very responsive host! He gave us all the details on how to get into the house in advance and provided us to tons of restaurant and bar recommendations. I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Austin!
,,,,,,,,The house  was perfect!!  Great location and plenty of room for my guest to have fun. Also great bars located just a 5 minute walk away :)
,,,,,,,,"Amir's place was fantastic and exactly as described! The check-in and check-out process was very easy, and Amit was responsive to our every request. I highly recommend and will stay again next time I travel to Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"House is well-kept and clean. The backyard has an extremely nice set up. Also it is about a 10 minute walk to Rainey, and about a 5 minute walk to running path along river."
,,,,,,,,"Amit was responsive and was always available. The neighborhood was very convienient and the house was clean, modern and homey. I would Airbnb with Amit anytime. "
,,,,,,,,Amit is a very gracious host with a nice place. He is extremely responsive to any inquiries and has shown a lot of flexibility during both my visits (e.g. check-in/check-out times).
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a wonderful host, provided us with some very useful recommendations and the place couldn't have been more hospitable or in a better location.  Great experience."
,,,,,,,,Amit's place was the perfect home for our trip to Austin. The home is perfectly situated and allowed us to easily walk to the bars on Rainey and downtown. Amit was a gracious host who left us a clean home and accommodated our early arrival. I highly recommend staying with Amit for your Austin visit 
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a great host, we were a party of 6 in town over the weekend for Dreamhack. The unit is in a nice location, about 20 min walk to convention center. The unit was in great condition, clean, and well furnished. 

Before my arrival, Amit left good instructions on check in and check out and also provided a great set of tips on Austin! He also checked in after we arrived to make sure everything is great. The kitchen is well stocked and Keurig coffee maker was well supplied.

If I am in the area again - I wouldn't hesitate to book again here."
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a great host and we loved the place! He gave us a long list with things to do. The home was very nice, clean and has a great location. We walked to Downtown and there are nice bars and restaurants near the house. We enjoyed it!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a great host! The living room and backyard area was perfect for a group. The beds were very comfortable and I would definitely take his recommendations. Cenote was a great coffee shop and walking distance! Definitely
Would go back."
,,,,,,,,Amit's place was great for my friend/colleague and me. It was an easy walk to our downtown office as well as the Rainey street nightlife.
,,,,,,,,Amit was a fantastic host.   He was readily available for any questions and gave us a huge list of recommendations to do in the city.   The place was well kept with plenty of sleeping space for all of us.   The house is around the corner Rainey street and walkable to 6th which made it perfect for going out.  Ubers were easy to call and always nearby.  All in all this was the perfect place to stay for the bachelor party.  Not to mention his unit next door is also fantastic and is a great way for bigger groups to avoid Austin's 6 person occupancy limits.   We would definitely stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"House was consistent to the description.  Clean, very roomy, great outdoor entertaining area.  Location was perfect.  Overall, Amit was a great host and I would stay here again.  "
,,,,,,,,Amit's place was perfect for our Bachelorette Weekend in Austin. The open floor plan of the house was great for our group. We were disappointed that it rained while we were there because we really wanted to use the awesome backyard. Amit was extremely helpful upon arrival and gave us a ton of suggestions as far as restaurants and places to go around Austin. I recommend this house and would definitely rent from Amit again! 
,,,,,,,,Amit was an incredible host and made our experience very easy and enjoyable. He was always available to answer questions with almost no wait time for an answer! He even provided us with a terrific guide of anything we could want to do in the city - making it very easy for a group of us that had no prior knowledge of Austin. The listing could not do the house justice - it exceeded all of our expectations. It felt homey and had an incredible backyard! The location was great and  was just a short uber/walk/drive to almost anywhere in the city. I would highly recommend anyone to stay here and would absolutely stay there again the next time I am in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at Amit's place. It was quiet, comfortable and close to the park as well as Rainey Street and downtown. We stayed there for SXSW and I couldn't have been happier with our choice.

Amit was easy to communicate with and very nice to deal with.

I would highly recommend staying here and would gladly rent from him again."
,,,,,,,,"Amit's place was exactly what our group needed while visiting Austin. A short walk to the downtown area and nicely equipped, the house is a great option - whether you're in town for business or leisure. The backyard is fantastic if you want to entertain / barbecue, and the rooms are comfortable and well-lit. Will definitely stay here again if I return!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a great host and made our first Airbnb experience very enjoyable.  The house was amazing, even better than the pictures!  It was nicely decorated and the backyard was very pleasant.  The location was great, it's just a quick Uber (or walk, weather permitting) from pretty much everywhere in the city.  We had five people stay here and there was plenty of space, I would highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,Very centrally located to the entertainment areas in Austin with plenty of space to relax.  The host's welcome email was immensely helpful in helping us plan our weekend.  We had a great time here and would return if we were ever in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Amit is the perfect host. We were last minute picking the house but he made sure the house was ready in time. The house was the perfect size for the bachelorette party. Very short distance to rainy street. The way Amit has the house decorated makes it so homey. The backyard is amazing with sky lights. I loved everything about my stay at Amit's house.
,,,,,,,,We had a great time in Austin at Amit's house! It's in a great location and we really enjoyed eating in the backyard.
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a perfect host, he made the checking in and checking out process very simple.  The house is perfect for groups and the area can't be beat.  You are walking distance to Rainey street and a short Uber to downtown.  I would stay here again next time I am in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Host was great.  Everything went smoothly.
,,,,,,,,Great house and great location!  Would highly recommend this to others visiting Austin.  Amit was very responsive and easy to work with!!
,,,,,,,,"Amit's place was situated in a great area with quick walks to really cool places like Rainey Street. If you like to run, there's also an amazing jogging area down the street that takes you around an awesome run path around the water.

If you want to venture a little father into the city, it's a quick uber ride to get to pretty much anywhere.

As for the actual unit itself, 7 of us fit very comfortably in his stylish home. We also really enjoyed hanging out in the backyard space.

So if you want a great location, a stylish home and a really nice and tentative host without breaking the bank, definitely give this place a shot!"
,,,,,,,,"Amir's place was great! The pictures are accurate, walking distance to Rainey street, the house comfortably holds 6 - more than that and your sharing sleeping spaces. Amit was prompt friendly and gave an extensive list of recommendations. Highly recommended for your stay in austin!"
,,,,,,,,Our group of 7 had an excellent stay at Amit's. The house was very well situated within walking distance to Rainey Street and short ubers to other locales we visited. The house is very well designed for a larger group - particularly the large kitchen and counter seating. Its perhaps a little small for more than 6 people. We would stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Great home, host and fantastic location! Amit was very accommodating on arrival and departure times, and made sure to check in with us throughout the weekend to make sure everything was going well. We would definitely stay at his home again."
,,,,,,,,Amit was very nice. He always responded to my messages very quickly and helped get us extra air mattresses when we requested them. Very cute home- the backyard was great!
,,,,,,,,Shortly after arriving we discovered a minor issue with the TVs.  Amit was very prompt and responsive in resolving the issue.  The house was clean and modern and well equipped and while not within comfortable walking distance to downtown Austin was a quick drive away.  It was our first time using Airbnb and it was wonderful to return to a home rather than a hotel room after a long day out.  Amit's home is warm and friendly.  We'll be contacting him when we return to Austin.
,,,,,,,,Loved our stay.  Had 10 of us for extended weekend (rented both sides).  The spot was just as advertised.  Quick walk to Rainey St.  Would definitely return again.  
,,,,,,,,"Amit's home is so cozy, beautifully decorated and walking distance from all of the Austin hot spots!! "
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved our stay.  Perfect proximity to downtown, but still had a locals-only neighborhood feel.  We had our toddler with us and with a bit of caution the house was completely safe.  Also was great to have the backyard for gatherings.  The beds were especially comfortable and the showers were deluxe!   loved it!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, just a short walk to Rainey Street. Amit's place was exactly what we were looking for. We'll definitely stay there again when we're back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a fantastic host! He was extremely helpful both leading up to and during our stay. He had great suggestions about the city, and any question I had about the location was answered very quickly. 
He made sure to be available if there were any issues with our stay (there weren't).
The listing description was very accurate and in a great location.
10 minute walk to Rainey Street was perfect! All in all this was a fantastic trip and a really great way to experience Austin. I would definitely recommend Amit to anyone who wants to experience Austin the right way!!
Thanks Amit!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was fantastic. He was always quick to answer my questions and was very responsive. I visited Austin for my bachelorette, and he gave us great tips of where to float. The house was perfect for us girls, lots of sleeping quarters and very clean. He even came over in person and greeted us and made sure we were all set. I definitely recommend this spot!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a wonderful, welcoming host. He was responsive, flexible and helpful. His home was set-up perfectly for us."
,,,,,,,,Amit was great and the place was perfect for our large group.  Easily walkable to Rainey St. and a very short Uber ride to anywhere else.  Could not recommend more!
,,,,,,,,"Great house and place to stay in Austin! Walking distance to Rainey St. and a fun stay for big groups. Well-supplied with amenities, too. "
,,,,,,,,Amit was a fantastic host.  The place was absolutely ideal for what we were looking for.  We were in Austin to celebrate a bachelor party with a group of friends and he was more than helpful with setting up the place and making sure that we had everything we needed.  Everywhere we wanted to go was right around the corner.   Could not have asked for a better experience.  
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment in an awesome, central location! There were five of us there for a bachelorette party and there was enough room for all of us to fit comfortably. Amit was very responsive and helpful, would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,Awesome weekend! Great house and a perfect location!
,,,,,,,,"Amit is the man.  Great house, great location, tons of space.  I would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,Amit was a great host! The rentals were perfect for a bachelorette weekend. We rented both sides and had more than enough space for 11 girls. The houses were found perfectly clean and Amit even left champagne for us to celebrate with! The location is great - an easy walk to Rainey street. Amit was easy to communicate with and always had a quick response. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a great host and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay and had what we needed.  He even offered to head to the store to get some provisions for us before we arrived...which we didn't end up taking up the offer on, but it was a nice courtesy.  The home was exactly as described and a short walk to the awesome bars and food on Rainey Street.  We all enjoyed our stay and only wished for better weather to take advantage of the awesome back yard the home also offers.  "
,,,,,,,,The host Amit was extremely accommodating and gracious. The neighborhood is close to Rainey street as he had described and he gave us great recommendations on restaurants and local spots to check out! 
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a fantastic host and the place was exactly as advertised.  He was very good about getting back to me with all of my questions.  Location was great, Rainey St is right around the corner and 6th isn't too far after that.  Backyard is an ideal hang out spot.  "
,,,,,,,,"This was a great house to host a group of friends in town for the weekend! It was fresh and clean and had plenty of room and a great backyard. The house is located in a quiet neighborhood. It is walking distance to Rainey Street bars and restaurants, and just a short Uber ride (Less than $10) to the downtown area. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a spot in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a great host!  Although we never met, we all felt extremely welcome.  He left us beverages in the fridge as well as chips and salsa - a very sweet gesture.  It's a cool pad and we very much enjoyed our stay during SXSW.  It's a little walk from the main drag of the conference, but overall a manageable commute.  My ONLY complaint is that during our last two days of our stay, we seemed to run out of hot water in one of our showers.  Not an issue that would deter us from staying here again, however.  Thank you for your hospitality, Amit!"
,,,,,,,,Great host and place to stay in Austin . Really near all of the bars shops and restaurants 
,,,,,,,,This place was conveniently located.  We were able to walk to a lot of places downtown like 6th street.  Amit was very nice and went out of is way to accommodate.  The place fit us 6 guys comfortably and could definitely fit more.
,,,,,,,,"This place is AMAZING. I was ready to move in and spend the rest of the winter is Austin. This place was a wonderful mirage in the desert after spending a less than lux stay in a poo-poo smelling hotel in Dallas. I would definitely come back. Amit was kind enough to give us a great list of recs around Austin, if only I had had more time to check them out. 
RAIN SHOWER HEADS. Need I say more. "
,,,,,,,,"Amit was an awesome host. Upon letting him know that this was a bachelor party, he made sure there were beers ready in the fridge free of charge by the time we got in. He was very attentive and made sure all of our needs were met. 

The location was super close to Rainey street and La BBQ, which really made the trip. I am definitely planning on rebooking this place when I come back in September. "
,,,,,,,,"Amit was an amazing host! He was prompt in replying, very friendly, and made us feel completely welcome and comfortable staying in his home. He even made time to check up on us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. He was truly the best host you could ask for! Also, his place is in a great location with quick access to various parts of Austin. Overall, great experience here!"
,,,,,,,,Could not have had a better experience at Amit's home. His accommodations were just as he described and in a perfect area. We were walking distance from the best street in Austin and the Colorado River. On our next trip to Austin there is no doubt this would be our first option. 
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful experience staying in Amit's apartment. It is in a great neighborhood that is full of new restaurants, cafes, and even a great yoga studio, but it is one not overrun by tourists. The apartment is comfortable both for relaxing and sleeping. The linens are excellent. Amit was an extremely responsive host, and there were snacks and wine awaiting us upon our rather late arrival. We would recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,Amit was a great host!  He was very flexible with our check in time and accommodated our travel and meeting schedule.  The home is exactly as described and very comfortable.  The location is unbeatable.  I highly recommend this place.
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a phenomenal host and more than accommodating prior to and during our stay at both of his houses (he owns two adjoining units). He kept in contact and made sure we had everything we needed while in Austin. 

The homes were exactly as advertised, if not better! We had 13 people (6 in one house and 7 in the other) and there was the perfect amount of space. The location is tough to beat - 5 minute walk to Rainey Street and very short cab ride (or reasonable walk) to east 6th Street. I will definitely try to book these units again next time I'm staying in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a very welcoming host. When we arrived, he met us at his place and had a list of very good reccomendations on places to go and things to do. The location was perfect, walking distance to Rainey St. The house was perfect for three couples. We hope to be back soon."
,,,,,,,,We were really excited about the house from the photos. When we arrived his mother was there to greet us and hand us the keys. The house was spotless and he left us a lovely bottle of wine on the counter! He checked in on is regularly and made is feel right at home. Will definitely reach out to Amit next time we are in Austin! 
,,,,,,,,"Amit was responsive, helpful, and informative.  The place was FANTASTIC.   Well appointed, unique, a real hidden gem...yet very accessible to downtown.   Just minutes away from everything.  We loved it. "
,,,,,,,,Great place - absolutely no complaints.  Close to Rainey Street which was awesome.  Clean place and Amit was a friendly and responsive host.
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a spectacular host!  Our flight arrived late in the evening, but upon our arrival we were pleasantly greeted by Amit, he even had some welcome gifts waiting for us!  His  house even better than his description on airbnb - it was truly a home away from home. The house nicely furnished and very spacious! The backyard was the best part, we spent numerous hours in the back just hanging out. His place is in a great  location just a short walk to Rainey Street! Amit went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and settled in. He also responded quickly to any calls or texts we made  during the stay. Overall we highly recommend Amitâ€™s home to anyone visiting the Austin area! "
,,,,,,,,"An excellent place to stay, with an excellent host. Amit was there to welcome us and give us the tour, as well as providing handy tips for local things-to-do. He was also on point to respond to any calls or texts during our stay.

The house is great, nicely furnished and has all mod-cons. Furthermore, it's in a superb location from which you can easily walk to both the city centre and river, and also get onto the freeway in a matter of minutes. Good value and would definitely consider staying again."
,,,,,,,,"Amit could not have been more hospitable or accommodating. He was very responsive, and we never had to wait very long to hear back from him. The house is super adorable, plus central and close to many downtown and east side attractions. Highly recommended.  "
,,,,,,,,Amit met me when I checked in and even offered to take me to the grocery store and back cause there's not one close by. He had beer and chips waiting for us and that about sums up how great a host he was!
,,,,,,,,"Amit was wonderful. He made an accommodation to meet me 1 day early to pick the keys up and gave me and one of my guests a tour of the house. He took the time to give us a kitchen overview of where to find cooking gear as well as letting us know where some hidden light switches were. 

The house was immaculate and exactly as expected based on the photos. The location of the house was extremely convenient to all kinds of great things to do in and near downtown Austin. We were able to take a 5 minute Uber ride (for under $10) to the heart of 6th street. 

We will absolutely consider staying here again. Thanks Amit!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was very kind to us from the get go and provided us a nice tour of the place right when we arrived. The house looks just like it does in the pictures, and the beds were actually comfier than expected - as in it was like sleeping in a cloud. Very unique spot with chalkboard wall bathroom and awesome UT mural, as well as high quality fixtures etc. Loved it!"
,,,,,,,,"Place was great.  Location was awesome.  Amit was super responsive and a welcoming host.  Place has a ton of natural light (recommend bringing a sleep mask if you don't like waking up at sunrise though).  Overall, great experience."
,,,,,,,,"Amit was such a great host and his place couldn't have been more perfect for me and my five girlfriends. I live in Austin and would definitely recommend his place, especially if you're looking for something walking distance from downtown or the Rainey Street area. The beds were comfortable, place was tidy, and the backyard was great for entertaining!

Thanks, Amit! "
,,,,,,,,"The house was absolutely amazing! There was plenty of room for the six of us and having 2.5 bathrooms was great to help get ready in the morning. We were very close to Rainey Street, which is always fun and a short pedi-cab ride from Sixth Street. Amit was a great host, we arrived in Austin earlier than expected and he was more than happy to let us head to the house, he even brought us to the grocery store so we could get some essentials for our weekend. Next time I head to Austin, I plan to stay at this house!"
,,,,,,,,"Amit was very accommodating, super friendly, and his home is beautiful. I highly recommend staying here. It's on dt Austin's doorstep. Easy to walk to bars on Rainey or and a super cheap cab ride to anywhere in the city. "
,,,,,,,,Very friendly host. We didn't have a chanve to meet but he answered all my questions quickly and was very friendly. Good location and nice place
,,,,,,,,"Amit's place was great. Big, bright, clean, and in a perfect location. He was really communicative before and during our stay, and gave us some great suggestions for food and drinks in the area. The whole experience was comfortable, friendly, and welcoming. We'd definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend it to visitors to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"This place is absolutely amazing!!!! Super clean and Amit is an awesome host! A very designer oriented place with nice amenities! Amit left us some treats which we drank and were very merry! Amit's place is walking distance to most of East Side - we even walked to the Capitol! 

If I ever visit Austin again, which i hope is in the near future, I will definitely be hitting up Amit again - I hope it's available!

Amit was able to make accommodations for 7 of my friends and I. Everybody was able to have a bed! Two bathrooms really helped out! "
,,,,,,,,The host was great and super responsive.  Also the info about the place is accurate and the pictures are spot on!  Plus the bathrooms are nice and clean.  We were 7 people so 6 people took the 3 beds and one person took the sofa. The kitchen was fully equipped for meals. 
,,,,,,,,"This house is perfect - plenty of space, beautiful, and great location and Amit was a great host. Would definitely recommend this house to anyone looking for a place to stay in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Had a fantastic time! Amit's place is even better in person. He was a great host and made sure our stay was top-notch.
,,,,,,,,"A few of my CouponPal coworkers and I traveled to Austin for a business trip and had the pleasure of renting Amit's East Austin home. Not only was the home beautiful but Amit's generous hospitality was truly above and beyond. 

bonus: Walking distance to Ladybird lake and numerous bars and restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time  at Amit place. Everything was like said, the house nice and presentable and when we come back to Austin we'll probably stay there thanks for the party favors."
,,,,,,,,It was an amazing stay - highly recommended for a unique Austin experience in a great location! Thanks Amit
,,,,,,,,"Myself and 4 coworkers stayed at Amit's home for the music portion of SXSW and we had a fantastic experience. Amit is a wonderful host. He greeted us at the door when we first arrived and gave us a tour of the house, explained how to turn on the backyard lights, where to find various items in the house, etc. He also stocked the kitchen with chips and salsa as well as various refreshments. The house is gorgeous and spacious and very comfortable for 5 people. All of the appliances are brand new and CLEAN! The master bedroom has it's own bathroom and the shower is luxurious! The backyard is the perfect layout for grilling and hanging out. The location of the house is ideal if you plan to spend any time on Rainey Street, which in my opinion is the best bar area in Austin. By the time we checked out, I felt as though I was leaving a home away from home. Nothing but positive things to say about Amit and our experience in his home."
,,,,,,,,"Great place - in an up and coming area of Austin. Walking distance to bars. Pretty easy to get cabs right at the corner. Amit has an amazing back yard and a stylish house. Beds were very comfortable. Hookahs everywhere!

This place is great for ~2-3 couples, or for a group of friends, for a visit to Austin. Thanks again Amit. "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Amit's place was perfect. We had high expectations going into the trip and we were still impressed with the place and Amit's service. 

What impressed us the most was Amit's attention to detail and willingness to help at the drop of a hat. Whenever I had a question, he texted back within minutes.

I will stay here 10 out of the next 10 times I come to Austin."
,,,,,,,,This was my 1st time trying Air BNB. We are glad for our 1st time we got to be at Amit's place. Though he wasn't there he was very helpful and great host. Left some chips and salsa and most important beer and bottled water. It really was a good experience. Since Amit was such a good host we will for sure try it again. Thanks Amit. 
,,,,,,,,"The house is conveniently located close to 35 and Cesar Chavez giving close access to downtown and 6th Street. If you want to get away from Dirty 6th, Rainey Street is walking distance from the house (which my friends and I did). The house is new and modern. Amit provides extra air mattresses, which lets you accommodate everyone comfortably. Another perk is the large backyard, which is great for hanging out and grilling. I almost forgot the best perk: Amit left us some alcohol free of charge! 

We had a issue regarding some potential damage to the house, but Amit was very professional in the way he handled it and we resolved the issue quickly. 

In short, I would highly recommend this place for SXSW, ACL, FFF, F-1, or any trip down to Austin. Amit is extremely hospitable and quick to provide recommendations. At the very least, come for the awesome rain show in the master bedroom!

,,,,,,,,"Stayed the weekend at Amit's place for a guys trip with some college buddies. Amit went out of his way to make our short visit hassle-free and enjoyable. His food and night life recs were spot on. Extra props for agreeing to pick up some essentials prior to our arrival since we were without a car. The house was clean, spacious, we'll-appointed, with a nice outdoor area. Short walk to Rainey street which is a great spot for drinks. Would definitely stay here again.Â "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay with Amit in Austin was perfect. The location is perfect for walking Downtown and to all of the spots in East Austin. The house itself was clean and comfortable (not to mention modern and well decorated.)  Amit was really easy to communicate with, and he made an effort to meet all of our needs with extra beds, bedding, etc.  He was even thoughtful enough to leave us the best kind of welcome gift (alcohol.)  I would definitely recommend a stay here to any and all. "
,,,,,,,,"comfort, location, charm, & style â€“Amitâ€™s house has it all! 
While planning our trip to Austin City Limits, my friends and I searched for a â€œhome away from home.â€
We definitely could have not picked a better place!  Amit was the perfect host, making sure we had everything we needed even before we arrived to Austin.  He went the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable, and enjoyed our stay.  Little details such as his thoughtful â€œwelcomeâ€ hand-written note, fresh flowers on the dining room table, and delicious local Austin treats! (chips, salsa, beer, yum!) made our stay extra special.  Check-in was fast and extremely easy -the same can be said about check-out.  
The home is BEAUTIFUL and tastefully decorated!  Modern (yet cozy), clean, spacious, and extremely functional!  The house had everything we could ever need and more.  From a private parking pad, wi-fi, and laundryâ€¦to umbrellas and ponchos in case it rained!  
Location was great, with easy access to I-35, yet secluded in a quiet and safe neighborhood.  Close to the airport, 6th street, Zilker, and all major attractions.  A quick and pleasant walk to bars, restaurants, coffee shops, & Rainey Street!  
Truly an East Austin paradise with a world-traveler flair!  We will definitely come back next time we are in town.  Thanks Amit for hosting us!
 "
,,,,,,,,"Amit was a great host.  His house is modern, and comfortably sized, with a nice backyard to relax in.  Walking distance to Rainey St, and a short drive to most everything else Austin has to offer!"
,,,,,,,,"Great modern house, new everything and a perfect location. You wonâ€™t believe how close you are to where youâ€™ll want to be. We recently rented this house for a guys weekend in Austin and couldnâ€™t be happier. The house is extremely nice with nicely designed touches that truly make you feel you are someplace special. And the location, just about four blocks from Rainy Street, and a 20 min walk downtown, is perfectly situated for the best parts of town.

Our host Amit was really amazing as well. He was very easy to communicate with leading up to our trip. He provided plenty of information and ideas for things to do and see in town. Once we made it to Austin, he was punctual for check-in and check-out and available at the drop of a hat if we had any questions.

Iâ€™ll be coming right back to the Travelerâ€™s Paradise the next time I need a house in Austin."
8267387,4.5,9,9,9,9,9,9,"We ended up not being able to get into this listing, due to an error with the key, but Betsy and Sarah put us up in another Airbnb close by that was lovely. Sarah was very communicative and helpful, even as far as bringing a space heater when the heat at the second space was not working. We did have to go one night without heat, which wasn't fun (brrr!), but the second space was truly beautiful. Sarah was also helpful in sending us a promo code for Fasten (new rideshare app now that Uber is gone), and recommending places to eat. "
,,,,,,,,Thanks Betsy 
,,,,,,,,"This is a lovely shotgun-style flat in a convenient location. It's within easy walking distances of some cool bars/restaurants on E 11th. Betsy is a great, easygoing host and the immediate neighbors are cool. 3 of us stayed here for a weekend and were very comfortable - it was great to have three real beds with comfy mattresses. 

Some very minor cons: Traffic noise from I-35 was very noticeable (though we had the windows open since the weather was so nice). No real privacy in the sleeping areas. Tall people have to perform some interesting contortions to wash their hair in the shower. "
,,,,,,,,Betsy's home is great!  Not to far from downtown and everything that Austin has to offer.  Very close to the highway as well in case you need to get a move north or south.
,,,,,,,,"The flat was very clean and inviting. We loved that it was within walking distance of restaurants, a convenience store, and campus. It was also easy to drive to popular places around town. The water pressure in the shower was a bit disappointing, but that was the only downside."
,,,,,,,,The neighborhood was quiet and just over a mile to downtown.  
,,,,,,,,Betsy's house in Austin was awesome! Had a great stay -- close to both the Eastside spots and to downtown. I had a conference on UT's campus and it was within walking distance. Would stay there again! 
,,,,,,,,"The place was very comfortable to stay and as described. The wifi is pretty weak, so we had trouble connecting often. The house itself is on the older side, so it has creaky floors and just an old house feel. Everything was pretty comfortable and it is very spacious. It takes about a 25 minute walk to get to the 6th st downtown area or fast cash pickup."
,,,,,,,,What a great stay!
,,,,,,,,"Great value for the spot, good location."
,,,,,,,,"Betsy was great, the neighborhood was amazing, and there was plenty of air conditioning. However, there was bad water pressure and no hot water, which definitely bummed us out. We paid majorly surged prices because it was ACL, and so that was a bummed. "
,,,,,,,,"Betsy was very accommodating and responded to questions quickly. Arrival and departure were super easy. The area was perfect, so close to UT and easy access to downtown. The apartment had everything and was just as described in the pictures.  I'm a former Austin resident and can tell you that if you are not familiar with Austin, this is perfect location for anyone coming into town for a UT game, for business at the Capitol or just for fun. Great time!! Hook'em! "
,,,,,,,,"The check in process was very easy. The space is big and location is very convenient. The parking space is definitely a big plus. The issues that we had were that the internet didn't work during the entire trip, the space was much older than appeared in pictures (although clean) and that Betsy was very difficult to get a hold of over text.  "
,,,,,,,,I really like the location and the flat itself. A lot of things to utilize in the house and you can accomodate 5-6 people in this house. Very Recommended. 
,,,,,,,,"Our stay in Betsy's flat was nice. The flat is as described and very large. Even if it is close to downtown, a car, which can be parked behind the house, is in my opinion necessary. Wifi is present but quite weak. Also, if you are able to bring some stuff to cook, do so because the kitchen is not fully equiped. Betsy made our access into the flat very easy. Overall, our stay in this flat was very nice. "
,,,,,,,,"that's a good house,enjoy!"
,,,,,,,,Betsy was very organized. The check-in/check-out process was very easy.  Beautiful apartment! Would absolutely stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Easy last minute booking. Host made it very easy for me to get the key and crash with my late night arrival. Neighborhood has some great music and restaurants over on 11th, and the downstairs tenants were super friendly when I bumped into em."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time staying at Betsy's flat! It was beautifully decorated, and the space felt charming and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and residential. Whenever we needed anything, someone was there to answer our calls and help out quickly."
,,,,,,,,"This is a cute, charming, second-floor flat, in a great location. It is arranged shotgun style, with the living room closest to the front, then the room with two double beds and the bathroom, then the kitchen, and then the main bedroom, with the W/D tucked around the corner from that. It was a bit old-timey inside, but in a charming way, and all of the couches and beds were very comfortable, and the living room is very spacious. There is no central air, but the window/wall-box air conditioners cool the flat down quickly, and we never felt uncomfortable. The wifi is a tiny bit weak (though fine for email and light browsing), so we weren't able to really use the Roku to watch TV, but that isn't why we came to Austin anyway. The location is excellent, and the host has a list of nearby restaurants (we really recommend the Blue Dahlia, an easy 8 minute walk). There is also parking for one car around the back of the house, which is a nice bonus. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice place.  It is upstairs just so you know.  It was a little hard to find, but once there, its pretty close to things especially if you have a car."
,,,,,,,,"Betsy's apartment is in a great location near downtown Austin. My cousins and I were in town to try out Franklin Barbecue nearby and we were not disappointed! If you go, I recommend pre-ordering the month before so that you don't have to wait in the monster line. The neighborhood itself is quiet but we had a rental car so everything we wanted to see was an easy drive away. We also were glad we could park in the side yard because it looked like the street parking required a permit. Besides that, it was a fairly warm weekend so having three AC units was a big plus. The living room is spacious, though it was too bad that the wifi was down because the TV runs off of it. In addition, there were plenty of towels and soap/shampoo provided, which was much appreciated after a long day of traveling and sightseeing. Overall, our party of three had a very comfortable stay at Betsy's."
,,,,,,,,Betsy and her house were perfect for my family and I. We stayed there during a wedding. The location is very convenient and Betsy was very easy to communicate with. Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,The flat was perfect for me and my friends. The walking distance was easy to do at nite and day time. Pictures are actuate and layout was great! So overall great stay!
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 138 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is very spacious and comfortable, especially for one person. It has a ""railroad flat"" layout: 4 rooms in a row, so one of the sleeping areas is on the path from the living room to the master bedroom.  The only closet where you can hang clothing is in the master bedroom.  Big refrigerator, lots of kitchen space, large dining table.  

Very easy parking in the side yard.  Easy instructions as to how to gain initial entry to the apartment.

The neighborhood is lovely--it was very green when I was there, after a lot of rain.  It is called Swede Hill, and Betsy has written an excellent history of the area as part of the ""welcome"" materials.  Pretty little houses abound.  An excellent dining area is a few blocks away, on 11th St.  However, the house is very close to a superhighway--there is always the roar of traffic nearby.

Betsy apparently owns several AirBnB properties.  Do not expect the ""personal touch.""  She communicates solely through text messages.  Yes, she does respond, but it might take a half hour or so. The only human contact I had was with a downstairs neighbor, Anna, who delivered hangers when I texted that there were not enough of them in the closet.

She tacks on an administrative fee as well as a cleaning fee, to make the nightly rate seem cheaper--this is revealed upfront, so it's legit, although I've never before seen an administrative fee added on.

The biggest problem that I had was with the WiFi setup.  Betsy uses the WiFi from a neighbor, and it is a very weak signal that sometimes cuts out.  The area where you are most likely to use the WiFi (the kitchen table, because there is no writing desk) is where the signal is weakest: that setup certainly needs improvement.  The whole neighborhood has a spotty Internet connection, which went out entirely for a chunk of my time there.  The television is a Roku setup which works off the Internet, and you can only get certain Roku feeds, if the Internet is working.  If you want local news, forget it.  It would be nice if there were a radio in the house."
,,,,,,,,"Betsy's flat was quiet, comfortable, and well-located. We are NY'ers and prepared to walk everywhere but I would not call it truly walkable to many attractions. It's perfectly walkable to several GREAT barbecue places, some cool bars, and some taco stands. The 11th street area is fun and authentic. The bed was very comfortable and except for some late-morning construction work on the adjoining unit on Friday, the house was quite peaceful. There are lots of boardgames to play and thoughtful guidebook of things to do in Austin. We appreciated the large space and the many ACs. Betsy was not particularly responsive to my emails (and one phone call) which was disappointing but we aren't needy guests. Guests who anticipate needing a communicative host should be warned. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Betsy's flat. It was clean and comfortable and located in a convenient area within walking distance of downtown Austin. Thank you very much, Betsy!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was both retro and adorable. It comfortably slept all of us. It is a perfect place for a family to stay. We appreciated the french press and coffee made available to us! The neighborhood was safe, quiet and very cute. It was a perfect distance to downtown Austin, only a 5 minute Uber ride. We appreciated the list of suggested eateries and bars. We enjoyed a fabulous Mexican restaurant off of the list! Thank you Betsy! "
,,,,,,,,"Best spot I've stayed in for a while. It feels modern but with it's rustic charms; squeaky floors, not a lot of working light switches, but it's in a great location and at a great price. Very easy to get in and out. I would for sure come back again. "
,,,,,,,,"Betsy was super responsive and helpful through our booking process and stay!  Any minor needs while there, she immediately responded, and had some great feedback on things to do and stay while in town. Even her recommendation on transportation to and from the airport was extremely helpful. Would definitely stay at one of her properties again."
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay with a couple of friends.  We were in town for a wedding and the location was central to everything we needed to get to.  There was a lot of space the three of us and had an easy time sitting around drinking a cocktail or having a meal.  Would stay here again.  Thanks Betsy.
,,,,,,,,"The flat was the second story of an older home in East Austin just east of I-35.  The beds were very comfortable.  It was a large apartment.

The apartment had a nice kitchen that had the majority of items you would need.  It was missing pots & pans.  It only had skillets.  "
,,,,,,,,"clean, comfortable, conveniently located, airy and light. as advertised. some of the light fixtures weren't working when we arrived but, well, such things happen sometimes"
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in Austin.  Plenty of room to spread out. Nicely decorated with everything you need to feel at home. Great directions and tips included. Just steps from the UT campus.  Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"When we arrived, we found that some other guests had moved into the flat by accident (there are two rental units on the property, and they got confused). So we ended up staying in the back house, which was very nice. Comfortable, clean, and quiet! We were attending a conference at UT, which was just a couple of minutes away by Uber. Enjoyed it very much, would stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing place. Very spacious and clean and easily sleeps four. Great part of Austin (very close to the downtown area and Congress Street). Betsy was also very responsive -- there were a number of times that I contacted her before and during the stay, and she responded quickly each time."
,,,,,,,,Betsy's apartment was charming and had all the bare necessities.  It was in great walking distance from the action in downtown and Rainey Street.  Thanks!
,,,,,,,,"Very comfortable apartment (for 4) and very close to downtown and 6th St. Everything was in working order and the apartment had nice character. Betsy was great and so kind and accommodating when we needed to stay another night due to flight delays. Highly recommend! Thanks so much, Betsy."
,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed staying in Betsy's flat.  Being unfamiliar with Austin, I was unaware of exactly where I was in the city.  I definitely recommend a vehicle.  Stores, restaurants, etc are not convenient by foot.  Betsy and her husband gave me a ride downtown.  Very nice people!"
,,,,,,,,"It's a quaint, spacious flat with plenty of room for larger parties. There isn't any central heating but there are portable heaters. Betsy was kind to bring breakfast and flowers the first morning there. Beds are comfortable. Great location if you're visiting for work in the downtown, UT, or east area of Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Really good location in a quiet area, the beds are confortable and everything was very clean."
,,,,,,,,Cute little apartment with everything we needed. The neighborhood was super quiet at all hours. We walked downtown several times but also drove some too since it's about a mile or a little more. Betsy was super nice via communication but we never got to see her in person. The biggest complaint is that the specific address wasn't communicated until after our check-in time so we just hung out at a local bar and grabbed a drink until we could get in touch with her.
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Betsy's. It was the perfect cozy home away from home for a long weekend in Austin. As three graduate students attending a conference at UT we found the flat's proximity to UT to be especially ideal. The neighborhood is also really lovely: quiet but within walking distance of many nice restaurants, coffee spots, etc. The Quickie Pickie grocery/cafe on 11th street was a 5-10 minute walk away and quickly became our favorite breakfast joint! The flat was exactly as advertised and we found nothing to be missing from a great air bnb experience! We'll definitely look to stay here again when visiting Austin in the future. Thank you, Betsy! "
,,,,,,,,"AWESOME and funky East Austin pad! Walkable to 6th St, UT campus, you name it! Great area with up and coming haunts and eats!"
,,,,,,,,"The space was a light-filled loft wonderland! We loved the style of the the decorations and the extra perks like oatmeal left for breakfast, an extra fan in the bedroom, super comfy bedding, and plenty of space to spread out. The neighborhood was quiet and cozy while still being completely accessible to nearby hustle and bustle of downtown. We loved our stay here but make sure that you get the correct address in your confirmation, we had a little bit of trouble finding the gorgeous place. "
8666756,4.5,10,10,9,10,10,9,We enjoyed staying at Lisa's apartment for our trip to Austin.  It's in a great location in Clarksville within walking distance of restaurants and shops.  Footfalls were a little noisy overhead but not a huge deal.
,,,,,,,,"This little place was just as described and perfect for our weekend. Lisa was welcoming and responsive. The bed was comfortable and spacious enough for two. As others have mentioned, the movement of the upstairs neighbors is loud at times. However, this didn't interrupt our sleep or bother us all that much. Overall, we loved our experience staying at Lisa's place."
,,,,,,,,It is a good place and handy location. Everything was fine and clean.
,,,,,,,,"Checking in was a breeze. Lisa is super responsive and accommodating. Immediate surrounding neighborhood is quite cute. The apartment itself is small but comfortable for a max of two people. The shower is a bit lacking - weak water pressure and it's very low. A tall person would not have an enjoyable showering experience. But if you're on the shorter side and not fussy, it's adequate. The neighbors upstairs are kind of loud - you can hear then thumping around. It wasn't awful since it only happened a couple times - but something to note. The distance to downtown is doable walking but really be prepared to walk...like 1-1.5 miles. I'm a walker so it was fine for me; though on rainy days it was nice to order a car. Bummer uber and lyft aren't operating in Austin but getme, fare and hail a cab did the job.  All in all - the price was right, I wasn't expecting a 4 star hotel, and so I was content and comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Lisa's place in early May. It was just like the pictures. Nice, cozy, and clean. Lisa has a notebook with places she recommends and said she would be available by cell if we needed her. We did not need her, but it was nice to know she'd only be a call away. 

Location is good. It is within walking distance to downtown, but be prepared to really walk! There are a few great places nice and close to the apartment, but it's a little hike to downtown. I didn't mind it though. 

Since Uber and Lyft no longer run in Austin we did call a cab once to take us to SOCO distract and the cab fare was a little over $10 each way. Just to give you an idea. We rented bikes through Austin B-cyle and that was great to have! Highly recommend. 

Neighbors were a bit noisy one night, but other than that they were fine. I thought the bed was comfortable unlike a few other reviews. 

I understand that this is a studio apartment and space is limited, but it'd be nice to have SOME access to hangers or a drawer. I had a few dresses packed on hangers and because the closet is locked I hung them on the curtain rod. She had an empty shelf that I stashed some clothes on. 

This was my first experience with AirBnB, and I would do it again! Thanks Lisa!"
,,,,,,,,"Lisa's place was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to be in a good location in downtown Austin. The bed was very comfortable and everything was just as she said it was going to be and more. We were walking distance from some great restaurants and a short uber ride away from any attractions that we wanted to visit. The TV had Netflix so we were able to relax and watch TV when we came back to the house. The only downside I would warn about would be a little bit of noise that comes from the upstairs neighbors, but it's really not bad at all. Just a few footsteps here and there. But to anyone reading this, I would definitely recommend Lisa's place! "
,,,,,,,,"Lisa's place was great. Check in was a breeze and the apartment had a clean feel, with the small exception of the tub which was a bit dirty. Lisa provided us with the wifi password which was a plus. The location could not have been better, we were able to walk to pretty much anywhere in the city and if we did uber it was never more than $10. The only other downside I would say is the walls are very thin and we were able to hear the neighbors loudly, especially the upstairs neighbor when the would walk around. Overall, the place is great and would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Lisa was a wonderful host. Her apartment is as adorable as pictured in a great little neighborhood in the heart of Austin. The perfect spot to call home for a few days in town. Lisa was kind enough to let us check in a few hours early, which we greatly appreciate. The upstairs neighbors seem to have heavy feet but besides that out stay was great. Would recommend this spot! "
,,,,,,,,"Lisa's place is in a good location, quiet neighborhood, clean apt, and she responds promptly. But it basically ends there. 
 
When we arrived, we had communicated that we were arriving early and Lisa was fine with that. We ended up being locked out of the apt at 5am because she forgot that someone else was there. We had to wait 7 hrs for the checkout and cleaning. She apologized and we got on with our trip.

We stayed for 4 days, and almost every night the upstairs neighbors sounded like 500lb gorillas, sometimes going on until 4am. I could only guess from the amount of noise going on, that they were moving furniture, falling over, and losing sacks of marbles on the floor. There is no noise barrier, so unless you sleep like the dead, no one should be staying here. I don't know how anyone lives here."
,,,,,,,,"Lisa was great! She left a nice note with suggested activities, restaurants, places to see, etc. that was very helpful in planning my trip. The instructions for arrival were very clear and easy to follow. "
,,,,,,,,"Our first visit to Austin was great! Lisa helped us a lot. She was always available if we needed anything. Location was great too, Really nice hike/run to the river. I Definitely recommend her place. "
,,,,,,,,"Lisa's spot was a great location - she left a great list of recommendations! Lots were walkable, and it was super easy to get an Ã¼ber anywhere else we wanted to check out! "
,,,,,,,,Lisa's Apartment was in a pretty decent position. we either walked around town quite easily or took a cheap uber around another parts of Austin. Very clean and comfortable spot would recommend. Neighbours upstairs aren't so much noisy as the roof is a bit thin. It's just them walking around which they don't do all night!
,,,,,,,,"Apartment was easy to find and nearly perfect for our needs! As others have mentioned, the upstairs neighbors often make noise in the middle of the night (sounds like furniture moving). But there's a neighborhood cat that made returning to the apartment after each long day an absolute joy."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was as described, neat and tidy and in a quiet neighborhood.  A good base away from the craziness of SxSW activities.  Comfortable bed!  Very responsive host who answered all my questions.  "
,,,,,,,,"This is a cute apartment in a great area!  It is very close to lots of great restaurants and bars. The walls are very thin, and we could hear the neighbors more than we expected. Bed was not that comfy with two of us in there. "
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at Lisa's place. The location was great and the bed was very comfortable. Overall would totally reccomend, communicating with Lisa was easy upon arrival and made the trip very smooth. "
,,,,,,,,"Cozy little studio within walking distance of 6th street and has the basic essentials. Lisa was very communicative and helpful hostess. We were visiting for work but also wanted to explore so didn't spend too much time at the apartment during the day. All in all our stay was good, but would echo one of the other reviewers comments about the upstairs neighbor being quite loud in the middle of the night a few nights while we were there. Would still recommend, but just and FYI. :)"
,,,,,,,,Nice place to stay in Austin. I was able to easily walk downtown from the apartment. Very comfortable bed. Would recommend
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect and clean. The owner was available to contact for any questions and was super helpful. Thank you very much Lisa. 
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at Lisa's place. Charming decor. Cozy. Comfortable. Welcoming. Quiet neighborhood with plentiful parking. Everything was as described. Communication with host was easy and thoughtful. We felt more like Lisa was sharing her place with ""friends"", than ""guests"". Thank you Lisa!"
,,,,,,,,"Upon entering her apartment, it was very clean and smelled great as she had the air filter and Scentsy going. Lisa was always responsive and available if needed. The location is by far the greatest part about staying here. We were so close to everything, yet in a quiet area; perfect combo. Bed was comfy, and safe parking for your vehicle. I couldn't figure out the TV situation, but that's probably just me. haha She provided WIFI access which was great! All in all, a very positive experience."
,,,,,,,,Great experience! Location was pretty close to everything. The studio was clean and just like it was described. Lisa was very helpful with suggestions of places to eat and things to do. Definitely a great place to stay! 
,,,,,,,,"This studio apartment is great! I was visiting Austin for a conference and it completely suited my needs. It is nice, cozy and quiet. Huge bed to rest, wifi internet, and a huge tv. There are restaurants and places to eat nearby, also a 7 eleven if you need anything, bus stop to downtown (which is only a 15min walk away anyway). Lisa was always  available and very kind. "
,,,,,,,,Lisa has a really cute bachelor apartment in a nice area in town. We really enjoyed our stay here. It's within walking distance or a short drive from most places. Lisa was easy to communicate to and left us with everything we needed. Only downsides - there's no wifi at the place and the upstairs neighbors were noisy in the middle of the night a few times. 
5307016,,10,10,10,10,10,9,Rich was an amazing host. His apartment is very central in Austin and is maintained very well. I would definitely stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,Great house.  Great building. Great location.  Very clean
4236671,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"JD made us feel welcome by providing snacks and drinks upon arrival. He helped with the limited parking situation during ACL weekend, and gave us his contact information if anything came up requiring his help."
,,,,,,,,"JD was a great host! Prior to our arrival, he asked if there were any special needs and some of our favorite snacks. When we arrived, the apartment was neat with our bedding out for us to arrange as well as a hand-written note with our snacks. JD made our first Airbnb experience memorable. Thanks."
5492366,4.5,9,10,10,10,10,9,"We really enjoyed staying at Jason's place during ACL weekend one. He was very accomodating with everything we needed (parking permits, multiple keys, bracelets for the pool, etc.) and he or his roommate, Pavel, were available in case we needed them.

If you are looking for a place for ACL or SXSW this is a great location as it's an easy walk to either Zilker Park, Downtown, as well South Congress. 

The apartment itself is great- plenty of space to sleep and overall is very comfortable. Jason and Pavel were kind enough to provide us with some beverages as well, which we thoroughly enjoyed. I would recommend this apartment as a great place to stay for anyone looking to enjoy Austin. Great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location close to the parks, restaurants, and night life. Jason was easily reached and responded promptly and was even willing to make suggestions. The place was clean and quiet. Definitely Recommend staying at his place."
,,,,,,,,This was a very cozy apartment in a great location. Our friendly host was easy to get in touch with and gave us his laundry card and access bracelets for the pool!
,,,,,,,,"Jason was very hospitable. He responded to questions very quickly and was flexible with our arrival and departure times. The apartment location is great. We were able to walk around to restaurants, downtown etc. "
,,,,,,,,"Jason was GREAT! His apartment is better than promised, in a very convenient location - just a hop to the park and even walkable to Congress. He left great instructions, was very friendly, and has free beer on tap!

The beds are comfy, everything is clean and I would totally hang out with Jason if I lived in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Jason's apartment was great. he was very flexible with the check in/check out process and his place was walking distance to the festival that we went to. His apartment comfortably slept 6 of us although, I could see 8 people fitting easily since the couches are huge. sadly it rained most of the time we were there, but we were able to watch the NBA playoffs on his apple tv and with the kegerator there we might as well have been out at a bar! haha very awesome, cant get that kind of a space with a hotel..."
,,,,,,,,This place was great. The guys were excellent hosts. Super helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend this place to people looking to stay in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,Jason and pavelle were great hosts. The place was awesome with everything we needed. They were always available with any questions we had and more than happy to help.
,,,,,,,,Jason was a great host. Easy to arrange key pickup and dropoff. His apartment is clean and very conveniently located...made for a great SXSW experience!

,,,,,,,,"Mitchell and Erika were fantastic hosts and we couldn't have been happier with our stay in their guest house.  They were friendly, communicative, accommodating, and unobtrusive, and made us feel completely welcome and comfortable.  The guest house was exactly as described and made for a perfect, quiet base camp for exploring Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Mitch was a very helpful, responsive and welcoming host. The recommendations we got were great, and the location was perfect. Close enough to downtown, but with a small town feel. It was a wonderful casita to return to at the end of each day. Very clean, spacious, and with all the amenities we could've asked for. Would absolutely stay here again. "
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell was an excellent host, providing an amazing list of recomendations for every neighborhood, food, drinks, activities ect. The casita as they call it, is even better then pictured and described. Very spacious, clean and has everything you would need. Would love to stay there again next time! Thanks Mitchell for the hospitality and experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Outstanding A+ stay once again. We adore the owners as much as their airbnb that is so welcoming that we refer to it as ""our home away from home."" Thank you for housing us in your beautifully designed and comfortable airbnb. We are looking forward to returning in the near future. "
,,,,,,,,"Our 2nd time in 2 years at Mitchell's casita, and once again, an absolutely outstanding experience. When we encounter Mitchell and his family during our stay, we don't feel like renters, we feel like neighbors. If only all airbnb were like this -- thanks so much."
,,,,,,,,"Great stay in Austin!  The casita is charming and comfortable and had everything we needed.  The location in Clarksville was perfect for us - loved being able to walk to the coffee shop & restaurants in the neighborhood.  Mitchell & Erica were lovely hosts and the whole experience was easy, fun & hassle free - loved it!"
,,,,,,,,"Outstanding stay at your gorgeously designed casita for the past 3 weeks. Everything about our experience was perfect and we thank Erica and Mitchell for your kind welcome as we invaded your property. 
The casita is conveniently near our daughter, son-in-law, and new baby grand-daughter, and that coupled with nearby restaurants and stores made for a very satisfying stay. We thank you kindly for making all this possible since we have been blessed with becoming new grandparents for the first time. We will see you in July for another 2 week stay.  Fondly, Marcia and Jim Avakian"
,,,,,,,,"Amazing little house, has everything you could need. Mitchell was extremely helpful and attentive. Would 100% stay here again when I'm in Austin next!"
,,,,,,,,The casita was fantastic - Mitchell was very helpful with recommendations!
,,,,,,,,"Had a wonderful stay at the casita.  It was clean, comfortable and well-equipped.  Mitchell gave us a warm welcome and local recommendations were much appreciated. Highly recommended if you need a convenient place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at Mitchell's guest home. So many details have gone into making this the perfect spot- from an incredibly comfortable bed, full kitchen with Topo Chico, ample outlets, speedy wifi, fun upstairs loft, to the beautiful decor. We loved this home!

Mitchell communicated with us throughout our stay & ensured we were properly checked in and even recommended great restaurants, coffee shops and places to visit. Our flight departed later than we planned and he very graciously let us relax and stay longer, saving us bustle at the airport.

The location is great! Old West Austin is close to everything, we drove to some places like Mount Bonnel and the Capitol but also walked to Terry Blacks, Cafe Medici, and Holla Mode. It's easy to get around with whatever transportation you choose.

Many thanks for a memorable stay! We will definitely return to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell and Erika were very accommodating and responsive. They always replied promptly when we had questions about the trip, and they were flexible with our check-in/out time, which we really appreciated. The casita was wonderful and perfect for 3-4 people. It was really close to Zilker Park and downtown Austin. We felt very safe walking around the neighborhood at night as well. I would recommend this Air BnB to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell's place is impeccable. VERY well done, with the most surprising little details like hideaway storage and a mini-dishwasher. This on top of features like a washer/dryer unit, outdoor space, and a bonus loft! They do a lot with such a small space. I've stayed in a number of garage apartments and, while convenient, they can feel cramped. Here you can really spread out and even get privacy from any companions. It was also great to be back in my old neighborhood (I adore West Austin) and loved my short stay so much that I'm going back for 2 weeks!"
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell's guest house was the perfect place to stay in Austin. The place was spotless, decorated beautifully, and contained pretty much anything we needed (towels, iron, hair dryer, extra blankets, stocked kitchen, washer and dryer, etc.) He even left us two beach towels at my request since we wanted to check out Barton Springs! Mitchell was so accommodating, he was going out of town the weekend we were in town, but he made sure to check on us before he left. Their backyard is AMAZING and he told us to feel free to sit out there at night. The neighborhood is very nice in West Austin and it had that quiet neighborhood feel but there were still plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. I would definitely recommend Mitchell's guest house to anyone visiting Austin, I will probably try to reserve it again next time I go back!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a wonderful little space.  I would recommend this to anyone, especially if you want to stay in Old West Austin/Clarksville.  The hospitality was fantastic!

Years ago, we use to live around the corner from this place...between the house, host, and neighborhood, our stay here just felt like home. 

Thanks so much for the great weekend!"
,,,,,,,,Very welcoming and responsive host.  A very nice guest house in a fantastic neighborhood.  Thank you for a wonderful stay!
,,,,,,,,"This was the best possible place for us to stay in Austin. The location was so quiet and peaceful. The house was beautiful and everything we needed was there, especially the A/C, which was a blessing, and the washer/dryer . The bed was, unlike most hotel beds, comfortable. The location was perfect for us. We were able to arrive, pull the key out of the lockbox, and move in without any fuss at all. I would recommend this airbnb location without reserve."
,,,,,,,,This is a great little guest house.  Set-up works well for 2+ people with comfy bed in loft.  Wonderful location and very helpful hosts.
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell and Erika were absolutely fantastic! They gave such great recommendations for places to go in the neighborhood, they were incredibly welcoming, and the house is absolutely beautiful! It is extremely comfortable and stylish! The neighborhood is fantastic â€“ so many great restaurants within walking distance, and you are just a short ride or a long walk away from lots of fun stuff. We had an amazing time in Austin and much of that has to do with how fabulous this place is! This might be one of my favorite AirBnB places I have ever stayed!"
,,,,,,,,This was a great little spot!  Erika and Mitchell were very welcoming and kind.  The guest house is very clean and comfortable and was perfect for our family of 4.  We loved being able to walk to local spots too!
,,,,,,,,"This place is an absolute gem!  Everything just sparkles and we couldn't have been happier with the place.  It is so quiet but so close to all sorts of good things - excellent coffee shop, great bike shop, cool local grocery store (really good beer and wine selection too!).  You can walk to most anything you like - we walked to Whole Foods two or three times and there are a bunch of art and antique galleries  that you can pop in to on your way.  You can rent really nice bike from the bike shop and then ride to Zilker park and a natural spring where people go swimming and the Greenway trail.  It was absolutely the best - we plan to stay here anytime we come back to Austin.  (I forgot to add - the frig and freezer had ""provisions"" - that was an unexpected and nice surprise! )"
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell is a great, accommodating host. The guest house was the perfect size for my Father and I, and I loved the separate loft area for some privacy. All of the amenities were on point as well as Mitchell's recommendations. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is fantastic.  Mitchell and Erika were fantastic hosts. Located in a perfect spot with great coffee, grocery and milkshakes within walking distance. We will be back! Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Great little guest house, close to downtown Austin and around the corner from it's own local charm. Everything you need and then some.
"
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell is a great host. Their Guest House is fantastic. Private, easy to find, great parking (I didn't arrive until 11:30pm - no problem, as the key is in a lockbox). We would definitely stay there again in the future. The guest house is well equipped and has wonderful french doors on the side that allow you to welcome in the warm air."
,,,,,,,,"Best Airbnb experience EVER! Mitchell and his family were wonderful hosts and made us feel totally welcome while staying out of the way. Two of us stayed for all 11 days of SXSW. Guest house was just as advertised and more spacious than we anticipated. Could have easily housed 4 or 5 people. Everything was brand new and impeccably clean with plenty of towels, toilet paper and paper towel. We didn't run out of anything, which is amazing for such a long stay. The washer and dryer and dishwasher were a huge plus for us. The yard was beautiful and the location was excellent, just a 5-10 minute bike ride from downtown or a 20-30 minute walk. Uber was only around $5 to the convention center.  We cannot say enough nice things about this experience. Given some of the run-down, sketchy places we've stayed in Austin over the years, there was literally no comparison. But, this stay was definitely on par with some of the nicer 4 and 5 star hotels we've stayed in around the world! Beds were comfy and it was quiet and private. We mostly just slept after the long days, but did spend one day at home working and it was quite lovely in the living room with the french doors open. Had to use both air conditioning and heat thanks to Austin's weird weather, but the units were fabulous and keep us happy. Only small complaint would be the couch which wasn't very comfy. It was fine for sitting but you wouldn't want to sleep or nap on it. Which wasn't a problem since there were two private bedrooms! Great restaurants, grocery store and coffee shop all around the corner. Thank you for making our stay in Austin so wonderful!!"
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell was very accommodating, able to give good recommendations and provide anything we needed."
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell & family were great hosts to stay with for our first airbnb experience. Their casita is fantastic and they made us feel at home; definitely somewhere I would stay again. He had great insight on places to hit up for food (Terry Black's brisket, Nau's [breakfast tacos], Caffe Medici [iced coffee/toddy's]) and a handful were less than a 5 minute walk away. Downtown is walkable (about a mile give or take) and we would head out on foot for part of the day and catch an Uber when we found ourselves on the other side of downtown. His place was clean with high quality amenities and would be perfect for an extended stay with a washer/dryer, full-size refrigerator, dishwasher and oven but we chose to explore Austin more. :) There were only 2 of us but could easily accommodate 4 guests!

Some of our other favorite places in Austin were 24  Diner, Halycon Coffee, the bars on Rainey Street, Second Bar + Kitchen, Casino El Camino [burgers were awesome], Hope Outdoor Gallery, & Austin Bike Tours. 

Austin's a great town & we'll be back again!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a perfect escape for a couple or small family in a very central/walkable location in Austin!  The house was impeccable, nice appliances, furniture, decor, local art, and attention to detail that made our time there extra special.   Everything is brand new and the beds are amazing.  The kids enjoyed staying upstairs in the loft, while the adults had the privacy of a bedroom with door.   Though we are locals, we used it in order to accommodate visiting family and will definitely repeat the experience!  Erika and Mitchell were ideal hosts--prompt in their responses, warm, and available before, during, and after the stay.  They made it all easy!"
,,,,,,,,"Mitchell and Erika were friendly and welcoming, and of course did a great job with their guest house. The location is ideal: it's well-located for short drives/Uber rides to everywhere we wanted to go in Austin, and a short walk to great restaurants. The guest house itself was clean and new, with fun Austin-themed decor. It was equipped with everything we needed for our weekend stay; when we asked for additional items, Mitchell and Erika quickly brought them by. My friend Crystal and I would highly recommend staying with them!"
,,,,,,,,"I found this place less than 24 hours before I needed it, and was pleasantly surprised when Mitchell responded very promptly and got the reservation finalized. Mitchell was very helpful in setting up check in according to our needs, and also making sure the place was ready when we needed it. He also wrote a lengthy email with recommendations on places to go and things to do, which was a bonus! The house itself is amazing. New construction guest house behind a main house, beautiful inside. Two beds if needed, plus living room area with a full kitchen and bathroom, full size washer/dryer, big tv with cable. Parking on street was available in addition to driveway. Short and inexpensive Ã¼ber to 6th or South Congress, but great restaurant, coffee house, pharmacy with burger place inside, and liquor store all within 5 minute walk. Definitely recommend staying here with 2-4 people, or small family. Will be coming back and looking this place up again!"
2488976,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Super helpful and friendly host at a great location. 
,,,,,,,,"What a nice home. We felt so welcomed immediately. Our room had a separate entrance. We did not use the rest of the home, but Neeraj made us feel so welcome, offering us of the other parts as well. Such a friendly, charismatic host. "
,,,,,,,,Neeraj was an awesome host! It was in the perfect location for ACL and the amenities were more than I needed. It was clean with its own entrance. Would definitely recommend and stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Neeraj was extremely receptive and super easy-going. The location was perfect as I was in-town for ACL (2 blocks away), but also close to the river trail  and downtown. "
,,,,,,,,"I would definitely stay again in this house where owner Neeraj and Alex (his friend) were super friendly, laid back and easygoing ... 
This is Airbnb at its best, a community of like-open-minded people, who value communicating and meeting others ...
"
16157135,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,this is one of the best airbnbs i've stayed at. it was perfect! so beautiful and in an awesome location. we will be back!
,,,,,,,,"Adam's studio is a rare place indeed. Cozy yet modern and conveniently located, I cannot think of a better base of operations when visiting Austin. Adam was friendly, informative, and easy to communicate with. We highly recommend this host!"
,,,,,,,,Wonderful communicative host. Thank you !!
,,,,,,,,"Adam's place was perfect!! He was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed. Very responsive; he even had a water heater fixed in under an hour. The studio was in a great location, with easy access to everything Austin has to offer. It was incredibly clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Plenty of room for 3 people. "
11298450,5,10,10,10,10,9,10,The space was very tidy and just what I needed for my stay. The location was good walking distance to downtown and other local businesses. It was straight forward and convenient. Everyone was VERY helpful in giving me detailed information on how to get around the town and suggestions for places to visit. Very much appreciated! 
,,,,,,,,"Bree and the Guild team did a great job. All my questions were continually answered, like where to park, where to take trash out, how to access pool, etc. I would definitely stay again! Loved walking to Brew & Brew for a morning coffee, and we even used the pool one day. Much more convenient and enjoyable than if we'd stayed at a hotel. Thanks! "
,,,,,,,,"Very nice apartment and great host.  
Bree was gracious and hospitable. 
The apartment is very nice, well equipped, and quiet.  
The neighborhood is interesting with plenty of restaurants, food trucks, and good coffee.  
A great place to stay.  "
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at Bree's apartment, it's a real gem! brand new, super well designed with lots of space and a cute terrace overlooking a pool. 
The bed was super comfortable & towels really nice, fresh and soft, which is really important for me when I'm staying at someone's place.
Dylan welcomed me, was super friendly & even left a little basket with snacks which made my stay even nicer :)
The apartment is super safe & really well located close to many restaurants & a supermarket. 
I was delighted to stay there & didn't want to leave. will definitely stay again next time I'm in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"A very nice place, every facility and convenience at hand.. even a fully equipped gym and large pool!

This was a work trip but i'm already planning to return to Austin with my wife and we'll definitely stay here again. "
2447938,,10,10,9,10,10,10,"Stayed here with a few friends for ACL 2016. It's in the perfect location to never have to leave the festival grounds during the festival. It is exactly as described and the James was very friendly and accommodating of our needs.

Would definitely stay here again next year!"
,,,,,,,,James was extremely accommodating and the apartment location cannot be beat. We used it for ACL - it's about an 8 minute walk. Perfect! 
15371925,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great spot. Right in between East Austin and West - perfect place to stay and explore the city. The loft is a very cool spot and very clean. Drew was also an excellent host!
,,,,,,,,"This is a gem of a place located right off the highway for easy access to get to anywhere in Austin.  A quick drive over to 6th street is all you need to take in all of the night life you could ever want.  It is also within walking distance to the famous Franklin's BBQ, so you can get up early and try and be one of the first in line without having to worry about parking.  There are several other neat restaurants within walking distance near Franklin's as well.

The apartment is very modern with great style.  We loved the atmosphere and the feel of the place.  Drew was an extremely gracious host, very hospitable, and very thoughtful.  His place is great for 2 to 4 people, but if you are traveling with other families or couples, there is no ""private"" bedroom.  The loft is one continuous space with a restroom.  

The WiFi worked when we needed it, and Drew has Apple TV, which my kid loved when we were having some downtime inside.

Drew's place couldn't have worked out better for us for a quick weekend family trip.  Next time we come back to Austin for a short stay, I am hoping the space is still available."
,,,,,,,,"Drew was a great host.  His place is modern, clean with a great view of Austin and very close proximity to downtown and U of Texas.  Side note, the pregame Fly-over for the UT vs WVU game was right over the loft which was really cool too.  He was very accommodating to us with a list of his favorite breakfast, lunch, dinner and drink spots,  clean towels, sheets and a few beers which was awesome.   Overall great experience."
,,,,,,,,Pictures didn't do how nice the apartment was - a perfect place to call home for our weekend in Austin. Great list of recommendations of local places within walking distance!
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect. Affordable, great location, Drew even left us a six pack in the fridge. Had a great stay. "
,,,,,,,,Drew was an excellent host. His place was very tidy and clean. A very modern and chic stay for anyone who wants to explore the main elements of the city. Within walking distance to pretty much anything noteworthy of travelers. Communicated perfectly. Had no issues at all. 
12519062,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Wonderful place! Close to downtown areas. Easy to check in and check out. Sarah is a great host and the place is full of small personal touches to make you feel welcome. Highly recommend this location for your stay in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a wonderful host! She greeted us upon arrival. Made the check in process incredibly easy. She had a pamphlet with any information we needed to know and recommendations on what to do. 

The pool house was as described, very clean, bright, and open. Great location, close to a grocery store, about a 20 minute walk down to Zilker and downtown as well. Highly recommend it! "
,,,,,,,,"Great spot that is away from the hustle and bustle of Austin and tucked away to where you can still get everywhere in about 15 minutes.

Will be staying again if I return to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is located a short ride into central Austin, it is near outdoor trails and the apartment itself is well appointed and super clean.  The neighborhood has a great little market so you can make great meals while traveling.  I highly recommend Sarah's place!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was a wonderful host, she was very accommodating with our check in/check out times as our arrival and departure times were a bit odd.  The Pool House is a very relaxing, spacious living space for a couple on vacation, very close to the restaurants and bars of Clarksville and walkable to downtown Austin.  We had a great time during our stay, and we owe a lot of it to the peaceful nature of the Pool House and its ideal location within Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great property, location, and host! Loved it"
,,,,,,,,"Great stay in the Clarksville Neighborhood! We enjoyed ourselves and the bed was super comfy!!!
"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect, simple place
With private entrance! Sarah was always prompt in her communication. Located in one of the best neighborhoods in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah did an awesome job of hosting! Everything was clear and smooth for our check-in/check-out process and the entire weekend was flawless. Certainly enjoyed the place, it's central location and the very friendly and walkable neighborhood. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah's pool house apartment was just what we needed for our stay in Austin! Located in Clarksville, her place is just minutes from the vibrant nightlife of 6th street as well as the beautiful Zilker Park. Everything was just as she described and Sarah was a great host, making us feel welcome. We would stay with her again for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"This is a lovely little house in an excellent location. Sarah is extremely communicative, responsive and has a sweet dog, whom you might get to meet. The kitchen doesn't have a microwave and could use a few more basics (which may not matter if your stay is short or if you're planning on always eating out), but Sarah is very responsive and happy to bring over anything you might need. "
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was very welcoming and quick to reply to any inquiries I had during my stay.  Photos accurately detail the space, which was very bright and clean.  The neighborhood was quiet, and a surprisingly short ride to downtown, Barton Springs, and other popular locations, even during rush hour times."
,,,,,,,," Although I never saw her, I knew she was always available. The place is very well-stocked with everything you could want. It's a beautiful over garage apartment   "
,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood is lovely, and the space was very nice.  To have the pool available was an added bonus.  The host communicated thoroughly, including a booklet of information in the space, although I only met her once.  I am sure she would have been more available had I needed or requested it.  It was a private, quiet space.  It was nice to have a living area and a full kitchen.
The only caveat would be that the shower head is low.  I am 5'2"", and I had to duck a bit under the shower.  One of the shower doors was broken when I was there.  Otherwise, the space was perfect for my vacation needs."
,,,,,,,,"Our overall experience was pleasant, the apartment was very clean and had a rustic feel to it, like on the pictures. Sarah was a friendly host, we didn't have a lot of interaction with her but she put clear instructions and notes to make sure we have everything we need. In terms of location, it's not far from downtown but you have to have a car. We loved the neighborhood - nice, safe and quite.
Now, downsides..
- Shower door was broken at the time of our stay..I hope it's fixed now :)
- TV screen is literally the size of my laptop
- Bed was very comfortable but too small for 2 people
That's why I put 4 stars instead of 5..
"
,,,,,,,,everything i hoped and dreamed! slept really well. quiet but convenient to cool things. sarah came through with an emergency needle-and-thread situation - totally clutch. 
,,,,,,,,This was a really great place for our trip to austin.  The apartment was really clean and quiet.  There was plenty of parking and driving to all the major spots was super easy.  Overall I would definitely recommend Sarah's place!
,,,,,,,,"Sarah is incredibly helpful and made our arrival very straightforward. The apartment is clean, comfortable and a good size, in a really nice neighborhood with nearby restaurants and a supermarket. And you can use the swimming pool! Since she was a new host when we stayed, she was still working on the best way to equip the kitchen and so on. We made some suggestions and I think this will easily be a 5 star place once she has made a few minor changes."
,,,,,,,,"We had a fantastic stay. The room was a comfortable retreat from the hot and humid Austin Summer. Sarah was welcoming and informative. The neighborhood is quite, but it's close proximity to downtown makes this pool house an ideal location. The place also feels larger than the pictures suggest. "
,,,,,,,,"A short visit, but a memorable one. The space was clean, accommodating, and cozy. Although we never met Sarah, she provided adequate information and easy steps to make our stay effortless. My only complaint is the inviting pool and the torrential down pour that prevented us from taking a dip. We will return for the pool and the warm welcome. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Sarah was very welcoming and helpful.  The listing said no tv or wifi, which ended up not being accurate, which was a really nice bonus.  The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful and friendly and Austin-flavored.  The decor is pretty with plenty of room for a couple.  Price is awesome.  Great deal."
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay! The apartment was conforming to the pictures and we loved the delicate attentions (cashews - beer and sparkling water in the fridge...). We also tried one of your restaurant recommendation (Cipollina) and it was delicious. Thanks for hosting us!
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here with my girlfriend, as a surprise for her, and she loved everything about the place. Sarah provided everything that we could need for our stay, and we would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"The place was just like in the pictures, absolutely lovely, private and peaceful while being close to lots of good restaurants and just a quick bike ride away from UT.  We used the pool to cool down after our bike rides, it was perfect for a couple get away. "
,,,,,,,,Sarah was a great host and the apartment was perfect for what I needed.  The space was large and provided everything I needed for a week's stay.  Off-street covered parking was a plus!  I would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed being Sarah's first guests. We enjoyed the little apartment and it was super close to everything. The apartment was clean with a lot of natural light and the bed was comfortable. Sarah was very flexible and welcoming. I would definitely stay again. 
4186778,4.5,9,9,9,10,9,9,"The loft was accurately described and in the perfect location for our guy's getaway. Top Trip was extremely accommodating and they didn't let us lack for anything. The added extras (bottled water, snacks, coffee, etc.) only added to the professionalism.  I would definitely recommend this property to anyone who wants to explore the beautiful city of Austin the right way. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great host.  Perfect location to hit the Austin nightlife. It is a true loft style so there's not a lot of privacy, but everything else is phenomenal.  Will be staying here again. "
,,,,,,,,The host was so kind and welcoming! I had to book super last minute and she was quick to respond and SO accommodating. We had welcome notes left around the loft when we got there and even some snacks! Great host and great location. 
,,,,,,,,The place was very clean and accurately described. The location was also amazing.  
,,,,,,,,"This is a real loft experience. There's three doors here; 2 for the restrooms as there are two and of course a front door. It slept us perfectly but I do think that you should be quite fond of your roomies!!! The patios are great, the location is just the right distance from the 6th St scene. Judith was awesome to communicate with as was Charlene. I do think the price seems a bit high. We booked last minute and got the place for half price... Worth it!! "
,,,,,,,,"This place was amazing. In an ideal location (across from the Driskill) right between East and West 6th st, very clean and spacious, with a great balcony right over 6th. Would definitely come back again."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great, exactly as advertised. It was right where you'd want to be in Austin. I'd highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"It was an amazing experience, I truly love Austin and 6th street to be exact. The home was amazing and clean and comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location for my bachelorette trip.  Even though my friends and I ended up spending most of our time on Rainey Street (a short walk from the Loft), we loved staying on 6th Street (great views!).  Top Trip Rentals was super responsive before and during our stay.  6th does get loud (at least during the weekends) but there's a noise machine in the main bedroom and plenty of ear plugs.  Would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Excellent Place! Perfect location, very comfortable, and great access to all of Austin. Definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"The location was just unreal, so happy I chose this place as all we had to do is walk outside the door. The code entrance was so good no need for keys or card, nice clean tidy apartment , I would stay here any day .. :)
"
,,,,,,,,This listing is a great place to stay at for the price and location. There are a lot of little instances that were nuisances though. When we first walked in the tool there was a broken ceiling tile on the floor. The cupboards were coming unhinged from the wall. There was a pipe dripping water into the bathroom sink. The chair arms were wiggly. The internet was VERY slow. The airbed had a hole in it. If you have any problems you can only call from 9-5.
,,,,,,,,I enjoyed every second of it.  The view was amazing.  You cannot go wrong when booking this place 
,,,,,,,,"Our time at this location was awesome. For starters, it's in an fantastic location in the heart of down town and on sixth street. It's very easily navigable because it's across from the Driskill, and walkable distance from other going out spots like west 6th and Rainey street. The location was very spacious and comfortable for our large group.

Top Trip Rentals was very accommodating and professional. Everything was well laid out and anything that might have been an issue was clearly explained. For example there was some minor construction noise, but they provided ear plugs for us. 

All in all, I'd come back."
,,,,,,,,"One of the most favorable elements of our booking this property was the responsiveness of Kalyn, with whom we booked the reservation.  She was prompt and helpful.  The property was convenient for the purpose of our stay.  I was disappointed at the quality of the furnishings, the draperies, the general appearance of  the property.  It served our purposes well enough but it certainly didn't live up to the property picture provided online.  Upon arrival we needed a few things fixed (the faucet for the tub, for one) and that was promptly taken care of.  The floors needed a good sweeping and since I found the broom in the closet, I did it myself.  
Also, I must have  missed that there is only a bath and a half.  For housing six people (or more) I think two full baths would be very appropriate.  "
,,,,,,,,"One of the best places I've stayed at through AirBnb! Location, Easy of use, instructions, perfect in all ways. "
,,,,,,,,Top Trips were great through the booking process. Quick to return emails and double checked we would be ok with the level of noise given the location. The apartment was very clean with lots of space. The building is in a great location right on 6th St. The noise level was fine. 
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 98 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Walking distance to Rainey, 6th, downtown, East Austin, etc. Plenty of great restaurants and bars nearby. Check in and check out was painless. Host was very responsive and helpful. Would definitely stay here again/recommend to friends. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location, value and amenities. This is one of the best AirBnbs I've ever stayed in. Thanks, Cristina! "
,,,,,,,,"Whether its your first time in Austin or you frequent the city, the location is perfect for almost all the walkable destinations. The place is clean and detached from the front house. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Absolutely beautiful apartment in such a fun city!  Very convenient location for exploring downtown Austin. Check in couldn't have been easier and the designated parking space was a lifesaver. Would definitely stay at Cristina's place in the future!
,,,,,,,,"Love this place. It's perfect but I don't want to say too much because I want it to be available when I want it!

Jokes aside - traveling solo - best find in austin"
,,,,,,,,"Christina's place was great for our weekend visit to Austin. It's walking distance to Rainey, 6th St, and East 6th and located just a couple blocks away from a very cool coffee shop/bar (Cenote). The patio space is convenient if you're looking for a place to sit outside, but be aware that there isn't much privacy as the highway is close by. We would definitely stay again if we get another chance to visit the wonderful city of Austin!"
,,,,,,,,This place was very well appointed and comfortable. It's in a cool neighborhood and central to downtown Austin. Loved it. Would recommend staying here.
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful private apartment a short walk to Rainey street. Very clean, new furnishings, fully stocked with everything we needed for a three day vacation.  Our first Airbnb but won't be our last. "
,,,,,,,,"You won't be disappointed with this place. Great location with a cute, charming layout. Had a terrific, worry free stay!"
,,,,,,,,"What a great little apartment!

Though our stay was only 2 nights, we could have easily stayed there a week. As advertised, the space is clean, well-maintained, stylish, and stocked with all the basics you would need and then some. The bed is especially comfortable.

Even more so, the check-in experience was flawless and the locations was so great with lots of bars and restaurants within easy walking distance in all directions.

We loved it and would definitely return!"
,,,,,,,,This is a great little spot. Very clean and nice and convenient to the Austin Conference Center. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy and there are a couple of homeless encampments on the walk under the interstate but no one bothered us and we felt safe.
,,,,,,,,"What a great stay in Austin! It's centrally located with quick access to Rainey St and the downtown area (both within quick walking distance) and South Congress. The carriage house has everything you could ever need - some coffee and shampoo, to a washer and dryer, ample kitchen essentials and a huge walk-in closet that was nice for unpacking! I was a bit hesitant to book due to a third-party managing the property, but Brooke was extremely communicative and helpful. Check-in was a breeze and the space was quiet and private. Inexpensive for Austin and the quality of the accommodations, well-appointed and decorated, and the perfect home away from home. We wanted to hang out and relax more than usual, due to the space's welcoming nature and cozy vibes! I would definitely recommend it. Check out Moonshine just under the under-pass and be sure to spend time on Rainey!"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location, perfect for walking to great restaurants, bars and venues. The place was nice and tidy, good value, had everything we needed. We loved it, would recommend to anybody. "
,,,,,,,,"Accurate details. Clean. Updated. Everything you'll need to tackle Austin in comfort. This second floor unit - above a car port - is neatly tucked away from the thick of the city as a second unit. Access is secured and neighbors are quite friendly. 

It is only a 3-5 minute walk into downtown. It's about 10-15 minutes away from 6th Street. 5-10 minutes away from Rainey Street. 50 minutes away from Zilker Park. Conveniently located off the 35 for ease of travel.

Awesome place. Would book again without hesitation! Check in/out were streamlined; directions were very easy to follow."
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved this space. It was clean, airy, well furnished and perfect for our 5 day stay in Austin. The kitchen, bath and laundry were well appointed and had everything we needed. The location is great for exploring Austin on foot or bike. East Austin is a cool area! Thank you so much! "
,,,,,,,,Cristina's place was absolutely perfect for our stay in Austin! The best location we could've asked for! We went to attend a concert at the Frank Erwin center and it was only a couple blocks away.  We felt very safe and comfortable here and will definitely return!
,,,,,,,,"Loved staying here! The description and photos are spot on. All the artwork, furniture, and amenities were class. The unit is sort of like a guest house in someones back yard, but it still feels very private. The location was great because it was just a 8-10 minute walk from Rainey Street where tons of good restaurants are located. I definitely want to stay here again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,"Very clean and cost, great location within walking distance to 6th street and downtown. Very convenient with parking and clear instructions for stay. Would stay again!"
,,,,,,,,Beautiful and well-appointed place! Loved everything about it!
,,,,,,,,Great location and super awesome space!!!! Thanks for having us 
,,,,,,,,"I have stayed at quite a few AirBNBs, and this was one of my all time favorites!  Fabulous location near downtown, amazing layout, super comfortable, great decorations and amenities, easy parking, etc.  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!"
,,,,,,,,The location was perfect and walking distance to both downtown and East Austin. The place was beautiful and had everything we needed to make our stay in Austin comfortable and welcoming. I highly recommend this place and would gladly make another trip back.
,,,,,,,,"One of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Christina's place was very clean and looked just like the pictures.  Everything in the apartment was well thought out and had anything you could every need. The best part was the location, extremely close to everything and a short walk to 6th street. "
,,,,,,,,"A beautiful apartment to stay in, walkable to central Austin and parking provided. The apartment itself is very comfortable, clean and has been furnished beautifully and stylishly. Really felt like an oasis (July in August is pretty hot!)
Thank you Cristina and John for your great hospitality! We will definitely stay again next time we come to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The home itself is really well done. It has been updated and has really good decor on the inside. Everything we needed and more was inside of this home. They had sunscreen, half & half, and a lot of different items that we forgot so we appreciated that. We met the owner the first night so that was a nice touch. The house itself has great location in reference to the surrounding amenities (6th street, rainey st, lady bird lake, etc.) but we had some issues walking to get to these. The house is around two blocks from I-35 where a lot of homeless people hang out so we had to dodge them a few times. We also walked to get coffee one morning and witnessed a pretty bad fight between two homeless guys at a house near the residence. I would recommend using fare or driving if you are able to do so. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this house to those looking to explore austin."
,,,,,,,,Fantastic experience and great host. Perfect space for the business traveler. Loved the location in SE Austin close to the river and Rainey Street. Thank you very much
,,,,,,,,Cristina was great! The booklets she leaves have tons of local information and we would've been lost without them.
,,,,,,,,"I have never felt more comfortable on a trip! Me and my friend went to rooster teeth convention while in town and it was so close we walked each day. So easy to find our way around, and at night the city really comes alive. The apartment was super clean, comforting and had everything we needed that we didn't even realize we needed. I would love to stay here again and 100% looking forward to my next time in Austin, Texas! :D "
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at this apartment in Austin.  Everything appeared as it was described, it was clean and well-cared for and there was plenty of information left for us on how to work things in the apartment, recommendations for outings, etc.  The apartment is a great location within walking distance to numerous great establishments, and a short drive to everywhere else.  Quiet, safe and comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"We loved this place! It was very clean, well decorated and in a great location. Walking distance from downtown, rainy street and a East Austin bars and restaurants. I highly recommend this place, it was a home away from home. Thanks Christina!"
,,,,,,,,"Gorgeous apartment, great location, super easy stay, thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"I came to Austin hoping to experience the city like a local and this centrally-located apartment is in close proximity to everything that makes this city weird and WONDERFUL! It is a spacious and modern retreat with high ceilings and tons of light, an ideal place to recharge after spending the day in the TX heat. The bed is cozy and the shower has amazing water pressure, but it offers so much more  in terms of ambiance and extra creature comforts.  

In addition, Cristina has anticipated visitors' every need... a video in advance of your trip that walks you through how to access the rental, a fully equipped kitchen, and a binder (complete with maps!) full of amazing dining and entertainment recommendations in the neighborhoods surrounding the apartment, etc.  We had the opportunity to meet her during our stay and it was apparent that she takes a lot of pride in her city and wants guests to enjoy it to the fullest as well.

This was only my second experience with AirBnB, but it has set an impossibly high bar. Whenever I am in Austin, this will be the first place I seek out for my stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was AWESOME! So easy to find and access, in a great location close to downtown, and the apartment itself was very stylish. We got the chance to meet one of the owners and he was so friendly (their dog too!). Overall, I couldn't have been happier about our choice and will definitely go back! Thank you so much for your hospitality and the beautiful place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Very nice little apartment in the backyard (that felt much larger than it looked from the outside). Everything my friend and I needed and more. Bed was very comfortable!! Nice shower, too. Easy walk to the convention center and anywhere downtown or East Austin. Saw an armadillo run across the parking lot at night, which made it the perfect Texas trip :D Would stay here again!!"
,,,,,,,,We felt extremely welcome and the arrival and departure could not have been easier!
,,,,,,,,"The place was great! Easy checkin and checkout, nice cold AC, great kitchen, comfy bed. Location was perfect. Couldn't ask for more!

Pro tip: get a breakfast taco and coffee at Cenote around the corner. Nom nom nom. "
,,,,,,,,"This was exactly what it says, great location and very nice. We loved it."
,,,,,,,,Easy check-in and more than the usual extras at this property.  You really only need to bring your luggage!
,,,,,,,,"We had an amazing week in Austin, and the apartment was very much part of our experience. A perfect stay. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"We stayed here for 9 nights - first for a conference at the Convention Center, then for vacation exploring Austin.  We had no problems communicating with the rental company as needed and check in and check out were a breeze.  We loved the decor, it was as pictured.  It was clean.  The bed and couch were both comfortable.  The shower and closet were spacious.  The kitchen had everything we needed to cook when we wanted, but there were so many great restaurants nearby too.  The location was good for the conference - I took an uber can from the airport and it was an easy 10min walk to the Convention Center.  We also walked to Congress Street Bridge to see the bats.  We used the laundry washer and dryer in the apartment so we did not need as much luggage.  We highly recommend this apartment for business and/or pleasure!"
,,,,,,,,"Terrific spot, convenient to the east side and to downtown. The hosts anticipated everything, and all the little touches - from extra towels to an audio in cord on the stereo - made me feel right at home."
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place.  Really nice apartment with decent amenities, and super clean. It's in what seems to be an up-and-coming hip residential neighborhood.  There's a funky coffee shop/restaurant just a couple blocks away.  I had a conference at the Austin Convention Center, which was just a 10 minute walk away. The only thing to be prepared for is a bit of highway noise coming off of the Interstate.  But I had my earplugs, so it was all good."
,,,,,,,,"We received precise instructions before arrival, so access was very easy. They keys were in a lockbox, so we didn't have to worry about connecting with Cristina. The home was exactly as described. Very unique, clean and smelled nice. Comfy bed and great shower. It's a perfect size for 2 people. Easy access to 35, 6th street, UT and Congress. Loved the folder in the home listing local bars and restaurants! Cenote is right around the corner. Their lattes and breakfast were yummy! Loved Cenote's ambiance too. Will definitely stay there again! It was a great experience for our first time using Airbnb!!"
,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed my stay. It was clean, quiet, and convenient to everything I needed. Kitchen and bathroom were well stocked. The YouTube video about how to access and the directions were very helpful. "
,,,,,,,,My boyfriend and I had the best time at Cristina's apartment. It was perfect for our long weekend trip. The apartment was close and walk-able to almost everything. We loved how it was right between East Austin and Downtown so whether we wanted to go out on Rainey Street or Sixth Street or grab some coffee and brunch in East Austin it was an enjoyable walk! Sitting on the porch and relaxing was also a favorite activity. The apartment itself was impeccably clean and the interior was adorable. We will definitely recommend Cristina's apartment to any friends visiting Austin and will hopefully be back ourselves. We could not have had a better experience!
,,,,,,,,Perfect location-- walking distance from Rainey St. and nightlife on 6th. Definitlely recommend Cenote a few blocks away... great breakfast tacos!
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I spent five days at Cristina's place and we had such a great time! The apartment is cozy, clean, well stocked with the proper amenities, and it's in perfect walking distance to Rainey St. and the downtown area (although we typically took Ubers/Lyfts rather than crossing the highway by foot at night). If you're looking to try quintessential Texan barbecue, check out the 'la barbecue' food truck - it's a 15 min walk and worth the wait in line. Overall, we had a wonderful first visit to Austin and would definitely stay at this location again!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a lovely stay at Cristina's apartment! It was easy to find right off of I-35 and was conveniently located near downtown. I was attending a conference at the Austin Convention Center, and I could walk there, which was very nice since finding parking downtown was a mess. I would not recommend walking alone to the apartment at night, however.

The apartment was very clean, very nicely decorated, comfortable, quiet, and private. It was a home away from home. There were thoughtful touches such as tea and coffee to brew in the morning, bottles of water, shampoo, a hairdryer, and other helpful toiletries.

I definitely recommend that anyone visiting Austin stay here over downtown hotels. I hope to stay here again if I'm attending another downtown conference or if I want a mini vacation in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! Absolutely perfect location, and it was super clean and accommodating. We were able to get a late checkout for our evening flight which made it so we didn't have to drag our luggage around the last day. Loved the neighborhood- Cenote was a great breakfast spot, and Rainey street is a short walk away. Highly recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,"Cristina's place in Austin was fantastic, as-described and a great place to call 'home base' for a long weekend! Everything was very clean and well-organized, and I was pleasantly surprised by some extra goodies (like ketchup and my favorite sweetener, Truvia!). The kitchen was completely ready to be cooked in and the shower was heavenly. Lots of extra towels was crucial for me as well. My friend and I walked or took Uber everywhere and felt that the place was central to everything--our most expensive Uber across town was still only $8 or something. If I return to Austin, I will definitely check to see if Cristina's place is available before looking elsewhere!"
,,,,,,,,"Cristina and her management company did a great job with everything; there was even coffee waiting for us. My only difficulty was to find my way back to the apartment, since I arrived at night. This was easily solved by double-checking the directions. The apartment was very nice and quite clean, although slightly smaller than it looked in the photos--but perfect for two people. There is also a good bit of freeway noise, which is to be expected being so close to downtown."
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing place to stay! My boyfriend and I visited Austin for the new year and this home was the perfect home away from home. Just the right size for two people and a quick walk from anywhere you would want to be.  We frequented Rainey Street at night. The silver lining was the guide to East Austin provided by the hosts, definitely a part of town we would have never thought to discover. 

This house is a hidden gem! You get the privacy you want on a vacation, but are not far from the happenings of the town.  Plus the shower is amazing! We can't wait to come back and stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Cristina's apartment is exactly how it looks in the photos. It looks like it's newly updated and it is SUPER clean! The apartment is located behind a main house. I didn't run into/meet whoever lives inside the main house.

The check in process was simple. A week before your check-in date, Cristina's property manager emails you instructions on how to access the apartment. They actually have you download an app. It's super easy. However, the lock box code stated on the app. was not correct. We had trouble getting the key for the gate. We called the number stated on the app. and someone was able to assist us immediately and we got the keys.

Everything else went smoothly. The apartment is located in East Austin [ I call it the hipster side of Austin, but in a good way :) ]There are awesome bars everywhere! My favorite is White Horse. But you can easily walk to the other side of Austin (about 15-20min walk) or take a quick Uber ride ( about $5). There is also a small grocery store within walking distance about 15min. walk. 

Also Cristina was very responsive. We spent Christmas there and she checked in to make sure our stay was going well, and she also wished us a Merry Christmas! 

Last thing, ladies there is a hair dryer at the apartment, so no need to pack your own! ;)


"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, clean, very comfortable!  "
,,,,,,,,My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in Austin at your awesome home. It was spotless upon arrival and the layout made us feel cozy and comfortable. The location was perfect for all the areas we wanted to check out. Whether it be a quick walk or drive. I highly recommend this property! You won't be disappointed. 
,,,,,,,,"This was one of the best air B&B experiences i have had. The place was spotless, great location, and getting keys was painless. Would for sure stay here again next time. "
,,,,,,,,"The space was very inviting with little details that made it a home away from home.  There were ideas for nearby dining and shopping, as well as a fully stocked kitchen.  It was clean and bright.  I could play music or watch TV.  The living room couch is very comfy.   My host greeted me and made sure I was comfortable in the space.  It also has a great location, easily within walking distance of much of what Austin has to offer.  I could not have asked for a nicer experience.  "
,,,,,,,,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Christina's place on East 2nd and would highly recommend it. 

Although I didn't get to meet Christina in person, she was extremely responsive during the booking process and very accommodating.  At the time I booked I was trying to find something last minute and it was close to the Thanksgiving holiday so places were booking up quickly. Airbnb's site was having problems at that time and despite multiple attempts I wasn't able to request to book her place. After contacting Airbnb support, which I was also very impressed with with, they contacted her directly and told me to do the same. She responded very quickly and understood the situation and went ahead and held her place for me. 

I quickly received all the info I needed to access it from the management company she uses to provide service to her clients. Soon after I found out I had to be out of the place I was in prior sooner than expected. I contacted the person at the management company and explained the situation and she worked hard to get me an early checkin which I greatly appreciated. 

The property was very convenient and just as described. I felt very at home and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. 

Don't hesitate to book this property! Thank you, Christina!"
,,,,,,,,"My boyfriend and I had an awesome stay here! The apartment was spotless, extremely cozy, and in a very central location within walking distance to many Austin attractions. There is a little bit of traffic noise due to the proximity to the freeway, but it didn't disturb our sleep at all.

Cristina and the vacation rental company were also able to accommodate a later checkout for us, which was much appreciated!"
,,,,,,,,"Great guest house -- we found everything we needed for a week away from home. The hosts have thought of providing everything to make this feel like a second home. It was clean and new with superb craftsmanship; the small details didn't go unnoticed either (soap in the shower, laundry detergent, salt/pepper and olive oil, auxiliary plug for the stereo, great sheets, and on and on). We also were happy with the location (walking distance to downtown, coffee shops, BBQ food truck, convention center; a bit far from a grocery store though). Also the Wifi worked great! It was our first trip to Austin, we can't wait to go back!"
,,,,,,,,We didn't meet Christina. And had only one text message with her when we booked. The property is run by a property management company and is quite automated once you download the app. It does make things easy. So if you are the person that likes to have no contact with your host then this is a good place for you. We really liked the space. It was very clean and stocked with some basics if you want to cook. It has a great shower! I like the location that was in east Austin. Close to food trucks and Cenote which is a great restaurant/bar. You could even walk over to West 6th. We rented bikes near by from Cycleast. I would stay there again. 
,,,,,,,,"Such a cute place! Great facilities, so convenient, and ideal location walking distance to downtown. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great little 1-bedroom guest house for our needs! Lovely stay, thanks for having us!!!"
,,,,,,,,We really enjoyed our stay. The listing description was spot on and the space was much more comfortable than staying in a hotel. The set up of the space is perfect for two.
,,,,,,,,"Awesome rental. Great location, very close to anything downtown or in the east. Very clean, private unit with all amenities one would need for a stay in Austin. Would recommend to anyone. Shower was top-notch.

"
,,,,,,,,"I arrived late and was traveling alone, so I was a little apprehensive of the neighborhood but absolutely loved the accommodations. I was within walking distance to the convention center for daytime activities, and used Uber and pedicabs for traveling at night."
,,,,,,,,"Cristina was very helpful as well as professional. The home is very beautiful, chic and minutes away from downtown -- a prime location! 

Check-in and check-out were both easy processes. It was a wonderful experience!"
,,,,,,,,I had the most wonderful experience staying at the house. Everything was presented exactly as described. I felt like I (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication was simple and very accommodating. I would definitely stay there again and this will be a go to place the next time I'm in Austin. Thank you so much Cristina!
,,,,,,,,"This place is really great and the pictures do not do it justice. I was working at the Austin Convention Center all weekend, and it was only a half mile walk each way from there. The apartment has everything you need, with a super comfortable bed. My favorite was the porch where I could drink coffee each morning and sit outside at night having a drink. The staff is really responsive with any questions you  have and I can see why there are so many positive reviews. This is my new favorite place to stay the next time I travel to Austin !!"
,,,,,,,,"Very convenient location that's a quick $7 uber to Rainey Street and 6th street bars.  There's dedicated parking and a separate entrance, which was nice.  Also, while it's pretty close to the highway it was very quiet -- you can tell new, high-quality windows.  The best was also very comfortable."
,,,,,,,,Awesome location. Very accessible to downtown and could walk anywhere I wanted to go. The unit itself was very clean and nicely finished.
,,,,,,,,"My girlfriend and I were very happy with our stay here. The guesthouse was the perfect place for us to come back to after a long day of traveling in and around the city. I know it sounds cliche, but it really did feel like a home away from home. Very nice living room, bathroom, kitchen, and amenities. Also, there was delicious local coffee in the refrigerator and a nice porch outside for you to sit back and enjoy the start to your day. Really couldn't ask for anything else. This was our first time using Airbnb and it was such a positive experience. Thank you, Christina.

"
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 56 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,Great experience! The property was exactly as the listing and pictures described it. We were extremely impressed.
,,,,,,,,"It was an incredible place to call home while in Austin. It was close to downtown, safe area, walking distance, and very modern. Check in was easy and clear and Cristina was easy to get of a hold of for any questions. Will be staying here next time I come back!"
,,,,,,,,"Definitely one of the top AirBnB experiences we've had.  

Comfortable, clean, beautiful place with everything we needed for the weekend and more.

There are a few great walk-able locations - La Barbecue for one - and just minutes from SoCo and downtown.  Really great, and we'd definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Christina, John and Emerson Property Management were excellent.  Christina and John are the owners and were very welcoming when we saw them at the property.  Emerson Management are the property managers and I mostly communicated with them about the rental.  Emerson has an excellent mobile app that gave me all the info I needed to know about that rental like access, directions, rules, etc.  Very intuitive!  As for the guest (URL HIDDEN) was amazing!  Very beautiful, comforting and immaculately clean.  Location is A+++.  Rainey Street is a 5 minute walk away and Downtown and East 6th are 15-20 minute walk or 5 min cab/uber.  Oh and La BBQ is around the corner!  I highly highly recommend this property to anyone for your next Austin visit."
,,,,,,,,"This home was wonderful! One of our favorite Airbnbs we've ever stayed in. It truly felt like home, and was so close to all sorts of fantastic places to eat, drink, and shopâ€”while still feeling private and secluded. I couldn't recommend this location more highly!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment was exactly as listed - luxurious and fabulous!  It made for such a great first trip to Austin.  The location is excellent - very walkable.  My boyfriend and I could not stop complimenting little things about this place!  We can't wait to stay here again (hopefully) soon. 
,,,,,,,,"Very cute and comfortable apartment in a great location! We had easy access to downtown and Zilker Park by car and were just about a 5 minute walk from Rainey Street. Our favorite part of our stay was exploring the changing neighborhood of East Austin, especially 6th street with lots a great restaurants and funky bars. Again, all an easy walk from the apartment.

The space itself was extremely clean and well appointed. There were helpful notes in the apartment as well as a handy local guide. Check-in/check-out was easy. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time using AirB&B.  The process was wonderful.  So easy!  I had all of the information I needed before I got there.  
The location is so easy to get to, and close to so much.  I LOVED this apartment!!!  So cute, clean, and well kept, I didn't want to leave!  The next time I visit Austin, this will be my first choice in accommodation!  
5 stars!!!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place. Very clean and spacious.
I felt like I was at home, Cristina has thought of everything!
Thank you for letting me stay at your beautiful apartment. If I ever come back to Austin I will definitely book again."
,,,,,,,,"This was our first experience using airbnb and we couldn't be happier! Cristina's apartment was super clean, well-kept and designed beautifully. I love all of he care she has put in to this place and it was such a joy to return back to each night during our stay. The location was perfect, on a nice quiet block but walking distance to so many great places in Austin we wanted to see; Rainey Street, Congress Ave Bridge, East 6th. We will definitely be returning to this awesome city and would stay again in a heartbeat in this adorable apartment!"
,,,,,,,,"Great little spot for my wife and I! Really easy to get around to the popular spot, either walking or car/uber. Way better than staying in a hotel. Location/decor/price/amenities are all five stars!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was absolutely delightful!! So comfortable, we had an amazing time. Cristina was great to deal with and was available to reach if we had any questions. Such a lovely place and walking distance to a lot of fun Austin hangouts. Would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Cristina luxury coach-house apartment was superb for our visit! Highly recommended to anyone looking to stay in downtown Austin. Amazing location, walking distance to everything. The space had everything anyone could need, included a fully stocked kitchen and bathroom! Highly recommended to other AirBnB'ers!"
,,,,,,,,"Could not have been more happy with our stay here.  It was perfect size for 2 people, great location, and so thoughtfully stocked with essentials.  We forgot our sunscreen and they had some under the sink!  Ground coffee in the freezer was a nice touch as well.  Easy walk to Rainey St, Congress Ave Bridge, Downtown and 6th St.  We rented bikes only a few blocks away.  It was easy to get to the bike trail by Lady Bird Lake and ride it to Barton Springs Pool and South Congress.  "
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely amazing flat! It's one of the few experiences I've had in which the actual space was superior to the already stunning photos.  Great location, great hosts, great price - I'll definitely look to stay here the next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The house is a separate brand new garage apt. in the backyard of Christina's newly renovated house.  It was nicely designed and very clean, and just perfect for the two of us.  The neighborhood is up and coming and the interstate is very close, but being urban pioneers ourselves, we felt comfortable.   I would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome AirBnB in Austin. Perfect location, extremely walkable. Couldn't have picked a better home base for our trip. Clean and well kept space with well thought out design. Would recommend this space to any friend traveling to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"We were so excited to visit and Austin and try Airbnb for the first time. Cristina's place was exactly what we were looking for! Great location, well decorated, and immaculately clean. Not only would we stay here again and again, but we would absolutely recommend it to our friends and family. Thank you, Cristina! "
,,,,,,,,"We LOVED this apartment. It was exceptionally clean and tastefully decorated. The location was convenient, and a guaranteed off-street parking space was an added bonus. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to our friends."
,,,,,,,,"Great place: tastefully decorated, clean, and cozy; makes one feel at home. It's indeed super-close to downtown bars, and is right on I-35, allowing easy explorations of Austin's surroundings. Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,"Place was amazing, neighborhood was great.  Host was very accommodating and flexible.  Stumbling distance across the interstate (a block from an underpass) from rainey and sixth street.  Apartment was great - so nice to come home with clothes (and dishes?) cleaner than when I left.  The walk-in shower/bathroom is really really nice, and they've really thought of almost everything in having kitchen utensils there.  Remember not to lose the gate keys, though - you need those to get out!"
,,,,,,,,"This place was exactly what we were looking for! The location was easily within walking distance of the Austin Convention Center, restaurants and entertainment. It looked and felt as I expected. The freeway is very close. Though with the windows closed the sounds were not invasive and did not distract. If you are looking for exceptional views this is not the place but the interiors are so great it is wonderful to be there. We spent very busy days in Austin and this was the perfect place to crash, feel comfortable, and get refreshed for the day to come. We will definitely come back."
,,,,,,,,"Cristina's apartment was perfectly equipped, tidy, and close to where I needed to be. The neighborhood is primarily residential, but there are some cute cafes and bars within walking distance. The space feels very much like a hotel, but with the added comforts and conveniences of being able to cook and relax in a common space that isn't a bedroom. I never met Cristina in person, but in all of our exchanges she was easygoing and informative. "
,,,,,,,,"Our host was very welcoming and had great advise for touring Austin.
Their was was comfortable and extremely clean. The location was ideal. We did not have a car and was able to walk or ride bikes to wherever we wanted to go. I would recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,"This was the second time my girlfriend and I stayed here, and it was still just as great. Christina thinks of it all.  The guide book with plenty of great recommendations, the local coffee, and a all around nice place. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it. "
,,,,,,,,"Cristina's place is really fantastic. It was immaculately clean, comfortable, and cute!  It felt a bit like a tasteful and homey boutique hotel suite.  The location is also great. I was in Austin for a conference and it took only 15 minutes to walk to my meetings - faster than waiting in traffic.  There's a great cafe/bar just around the corner, and a late night taco truck up the street. The only thing that could be improved is the welcome/property information. A company actually manages this for Cristina, and in order to access all the info you need, you have to log online to their portal or download an app.  The info is displayed in a confusing/not user-friendly way, which I found a bit frustrating.  But the house is great -- once you get inside!"
,,,,,,,,It was the perfect place for our weekend trip. The place was within walking distance to plenty of our favorite places in austin and was so cute. It was even better then the pictures. It is the perfect Place to stay while in austin. I highly recommend it.
,,,,,,,,"This little apartment was a great place to stay for my business trip!  Extremely clean, and it had everything I needed (including coffee + coffee maker, creamer etc.).  The location was close to the main Downtown area; less than 5 minutes by car.  It was also really close to the lake, which has an incredible path that you can walk/run around. 

I would definitely recommend this apartment, especially for those familiar with Austin.  Great value for the price, and very charming!  "
,,,,,,,,"Stellar little place here! I loved the quiet and secure location, and the well decorated rooms. I said to myself multiple times; if I lived in Austin, I would WANT this place all to myself. Cristina was very kind and suggested many great places to visit for food and drinks. We felt very welcome!"
,,,,,,,,"I don't think there could be a better place to stay, wonderful hosts, perfect location, great accommodations, I just wish I could have stayed longer."
,,,,,,,,"It was funny showing up to this AirBnb â€“ it was just like stepping into the pictures online. The space feels brand new: it's beautiful, airy, bright, and so clean. The place is basically it's own home â€“Â a separate, elevated structure behind the main house, so there's plenty of privacy.

We were so comfortable the entire stay, and Christina was very accommodating and made everything really easy. The space has a nice kitchen and everything you need to make a morning coffee, or even an entire meal.

Can't recommend enough. Thanks again to Christina for everything. We hope to come back!"
,,,,,,,,"Cristina's place is great! Perfect location, close to everything! Beautiful interior, comfortable bed, and huge shower! Loved it! Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean space with great furnishings, I loved the book of recommendations they left for guests. Private space above their garage, everything was as expected."
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place.cozy, private, clean and location cant be beat.  Would love to stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"My husband and I loved this place- it's even cuter in person. It was the perfect size for the 2 of us, clean, upgraded really nicely with high quality things- bathroom, shower, a/c, alarm, closet, washer/dryer, lots of blankets and throws, great leather couch and tvs . It was literally a 5 min walk to downtown Austin, and right behind La Barbecue! We walked to everything in downtown as well as East Austin and Rainey St. This is a great little place! If you are a light sleeper, maybe bring an eye mask, there is a street lamp close to the bedroom window. Other than that, everything was perfect!"
,,,,,,,,"This is the perfect place to stay for a trip to Austin! The apartment is well decorated with cute succulents and beautiful wooden details, situated in the adorable backyard of the owner's house. The location is walkable to the fabulous restaurants on East Sixth Street, the quaint bars on Rainey street, and the sights around Town Lake. I would recommend this luxury apartment to any duo coming to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"It's always a pleasure to stay here, thanks again for a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Christina and her husband were both very warm and welcoming - the apartment was absolutely PERFECT!!! very spacious, extremely clean, and very comfortable. A wonderful experience. 
The neighborhood was great, my only regret was not having a car  - we are so used to walking everywhere, but it would have been nice to see other parts of Austin - however, we did plenty in the area, ate great BBQ at the local BBQ around the corner from our apartment -and had lovely cocktails during happy hour - also, we loved the White Horse for music.... All in all it was a lot of fun, and Christina was a great host....."
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is exactly as pictured, and scrupulously clean. The sofa is huge, perfect for lounging, and the bed is super comfortable! The shower is also really large - awesome. Having a washer and dryer in the apartment was also great, and would be good for a longer stay. And the kitchen has everything you need if you decide to cook instead of going out. Cristina also left me some great Austin drinks in the fridge, and a whole list of recommendations about the neighborhood. It was such a good welcome! The places she suggested were perfect, and really got my stay off to a good start. 
Another thing I really liked was the key and lock system. The way it's set up seems very secure, and I felt really safe staying there alone. Cristina was prompt about responding to texts, and gave me all the information I needed to arrive and get into the apartment without trouble, and to get around town. All in all, this place had everything I needed for a fabulous stay in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved our stay in Cristina's beautiful home!  Everything was spic n span clean with lovely warm accents.  Actually, everything seemed brand new and very well taken care of.  We felt like we were in a hotel.  We very much appreciated Cristina's hospitality and would definitely stay there again!

We think the location is perfect and is on the way to becoming a really hot area.  We would compare it to Highlands in Denver which got cutoff when they built I-25 but now is a super trendy neighborhood.  Cristina's neighborhood is safe to walk around at night which we did every night.

In one direction is a 5-min walk to the convention center and all that downtown has to offer.  Moonshine Bar & Grill is in between and a great little place to try their own handcrafted whiskey.  A 5-10 min walk in another direction puts you in the Rainey area with its fun establishments like Bangers Sausage and Beer Garden which we discovered the last time we were in Austin.

THIS time we discovered two new areas in another direction along E. 6th and E. 11th.  We had a great meal at the upscale Buenos Aires Cafe and enjoyed the local nightlife.  We discovered that Franklins BBQ and the other BBQ place Cristina suggested are both closed on Mondays.  This made us end up at a place called the Hillside Farmacy eatery for lunch and I had the BEST sandwich I've ever had.  It melted in your mouth.

Cristina's place is about a 2-min walk to a coffee and brew house also as well as local food trucks.  We had soooooo  much fun!  You will not be disappointed staying at Cristina's place!"
,,,,,,,,This guest house is gorgeous and in a fantastic location. We were well looked-after and Cristina went out of her way to tell me all the best vegetarian spots in Austin. We loved Cristina's place and would stay there again in a heartbeat.
,,,,,,,,"Cristina's place in Austin was awesome. It was in a great, safe  location. Everything we wanted to do was about 5 to 10 minutes away, so if you don't rent a car, it's easy to get around by foot or taxi. The home is exactly as pictured. The bathroom is really nice too. The guidebook she leaves is helpful in finding restaurants, bars, and sites. There are great places within walking distance from her home. Next time I go to Austin, I would definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great house, everything top of the line, convenient location"
,,,,,,,,The place was AMAZING!!!!
,,,,,,,,"This not-so-little apartment was absolutely lovely.  Full kitchen, full living room, many TV channels, full bedroom, walk-in closet, beautiful bathroom, even a washer and dryer, and a little porch for enjoying the warm weather.  I felt completely secure with the locked/gated yard and loved having my own convenient parking space.  The bed is utterly comfortable, the coffee delicious, the complementary wine exactly what I needed after a long work day.  Just wonderful to come back to this spot after working, beats a hotel hands down.  Convenient to fantastic downtown dining too, and walking distance from a great coffee shop.  Can't say enough about it and hope to be back!  Cristina and her husband were also warm and welcoming.  Loved it."
,,,,,,,,"This little apt was AH-MA-ZING! It's a little sanctuary on the edge of East Austin. It's walking distance to downtown, and I was able to take the river trail when walking to and from my conference. Way better than staying at the hotel! It definitely felt like home.

Cristina was a great host. She left a book in the apt of recommended eats and activities - all which were spot on. She left me a bottle of wine when she learned there was going to be a loud fundraiser next door one of the nights I was there. That was 100% above and beyond."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience with Cristina and the property. Instructions to access were very clear. The apartment is maybe even nicer than it looks online - they clearly took the time to build a well-designed place with elegant finishes. The bed is super comfortable, and they had a variety of pillows (important if you're a ""flat pillow person"" or ""puffy pillow person""!). There were some beers in the fridge and bottled mineral water in the kitchen, along with great coffee in the freezer. Check-in and check-out were a breeze.

East Austin is a great place to stay - tons of good food and drinks. Cristina's place is a 10 minute walk from all the bars and food on E. 6th and E. 7th. We were slightly concerned about the area, but it felt generally safe walking back and forth each night. We'd definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,I'm a man of few words...  The space was AMAZING!!   We were in Austin for a conference at the Convention Center.   We never had to pay for parking or cabs.   We walked to to the convention center.   We had amazing restaurants withing walking distance.   We will be coming back!!!
,,,,,,,,"We thoroughly enjoyed Cristina's place on our recent stay in Austin! It is really a luxury experience with a beautifully designed interior and extra details like washer/dryer, stocked fridge, and wonderful guide books. Cristina was friendly and available for any question or concern. The house is very well located and Austin is an awesome city! "
,,,,,,,,"My first trip to Austin was exceptional due to y'all's southern hospitality!  Thank you so much for everything...the gorgeous home, the numerous suggestions, and all of the extra accommodations.  The location of your place was perfect walking distance to Cenote, a great coffee shop and breakfast place, Bufalina which had the best pizza I've had in a while, bars on East 6th, yoga at Practice Yoga Austin, I even walked to South Congress Shopping district from your place with ease.    Uber came in very helpful when going to parties and the whole foods...only costing about $8.   
Your home is immaculate!!!! So clean and cozy.  Perfect for two!  We loved it completely thank you so much!!"
,,,,,,,,"Another great stay at Cristina's place, I LOVE staying here! Such a great location and a welcoming, comfortable space. Looking forward to staying here again next time I'm in Austin."
,,,,,,,,Couldn't ask for a better apartment rental for my first trip to Austin - Cristina was a wonderful host! The apartment is perfectly located and very well furnished. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting!
,,,,,,,,"We had to book incredibly last-minute and Cristina was so accommodating and friendly. The apartment was clean, modern and perfect for two.
The location was great and Cristina left some nice recommendations for food etc. So happy to have stayed in this lovely place!"
,,,,,,,,"Hi Christina, thanks again for having me, the apartment was so nice; you've done a great job making a little home in there. It always makes such a difference when you can have a little sanctuary like that, instead of a hotel room!"
,,,,,,,,"My wife and I fell in love with this cozy apartment which is so close to downtown and everything else we wanted to see. Cristina keeps the place wonderfully clean and well stocked with the essentials. A perfect size for two and the apartment felt very safe being up on a first floor. We enjoyed the views of downtown but also appreciated the dedicated parking spot right in the driveway. Our daily routine included heading out in the morning to either Bouldin Creek Cafe or the walkable Cenote for breakfast, then we would drive to one of the near areas like South Congress.
Cristina's place on East 2nd is the perfect getaway for any couple hoping to reconnect and discover Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Wow what a fantastic apartment. The interior is modern but comfortable and there is nothing like a comfy couch and TV after a very long day travelling. I also enjoyed having a music system I could plug my phone into for music while I worked.
I was in town for a conference at the conference center and this was a great location, only 5 minutes walk if that. Great location for 6th St. or Rainey St. as well, although it is a bit quiet at night so I got pedicabs or uber cars back most nights (both around $5).
Cristina was a fantastic host. Very welcoming but left you to be independent despite being on their property. There is a great guide about where to go that Cristina has put together. It was also great to have a couple of beers in the fridge already after a long trip and coffee in for the morning. There is also a cafe/bar called Cenote just around the corner with good food, coffee, beer and a juice bar attached to it as well.

All in all a great stay and I will definitely be looking at it if I return for the conference next year."
,,,,,,,,"I loved staying at Cristina's place! It is close to everything, beautifully decorated, and felt just like home. Highly recommend it to anybody traveling to Austin and I'll definitely be back."
,,,,,,,,"Cristina's AirBnB space is pretty much perfect. Everything is new and works perfectly, the decoration is nicely done, and the location is a 15 minute walk to downtown and a 10 minute walk to the Eastside bars and restaurants, which are better than downtown anyway. Cristina ensures that everything is in perfect working order when you arrive, and she's available anytime with tips and advice. You'll be glad you stayed here."
,,,,,,,,"What an amazing place.  The location was great, close to sixth street and a quick drive or bike ride to Congress. Christina's recommendations were very helpful and accurate.  The apartment was very nice and she thought of everything we needed.  My girlfriend and I loved our first stay so much we booked another night and are already planning another stay and hopefully here.  "
,,,,,,,,The place was fanatic and we had a great time!  Cristina prepared everything for us including anything you could need at the house and tips on places to visit and eat at.  The location was great and made for an excellent and comfortable first trip to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"This adorable apartment combined with a stellar location made for a perfect July 4th weekend in Austin. The number of unique cocktail bars (highly recommend Whisler's: 1816 E 6th St and Firehouse Lounge: 605 Brazos St) and delicious restaurants (our favorite was Clark's Oyster Bar: 1200 W. 6th Street) made for great entertainment. We opted to use Uber (URL HIDDEN) when venturing out from the apartment; again, which is conveniently located near downtown and Rainey Street. The apartment itself is spacious for two people and there is plenty of room to kick back and relax while deciding where to explore next. Cristina has done an impressive job decorating the carport guest suite to feel ""vintage Austin."" She was also wonderful in keeping in touch with us when any questions arose. Huge fan of the spacious shower!! This was so much better than staying in a hotel and I'm sure we'll be back for another visit!  "
,,,,,,,,A really nice place and Christina is super responsive.  I'll definitely be back!
,,,,,,,,"The listing was better than expected!  This is the perfect place to stay.  Cristina provided great suggestions for restaurants and answered our enquiries right away.  We would recommend this place to anyone wanting a comfy, quiet, spacious place to stay.  It is easy walking distance to downtown and several other funky neighbourhoods and pubs.  The air conditioner kept the place at the ideal cold temperature and was quiet.  The linens were high quality.  We will be back."
,,,,,,,,"Great location! So convenient to anywhere in Austin. Great accommodations - it had everything we could have asked for - a full kitchen, washer/dryer, wireless internet, parking, and cable. We felt like we were at home. "
,,,,,,,,"My search for places to stay in Austin began with looking up crazy expensive hotels. I stumbled across this place on the internet and decided to book this place immediately. I could not have been happier with this decision. This place offers tons of privacy, is thoughtfully stocked and very cozy. The decor is outstanding and really heightened my Austin experience. Cristina and John were extremely nice and helpful with giving suggestions to restaurants and attractions (we went with their suggestion of eating at Casino El Camino on 6th street and I had the best burger of my life!). The location is fabulous and only walking distance from a bunch of downtown hot spots. I cannot wait to come back and stay again! Thanks for the good ol' Texan hospitality :)"
,,,,,,,,"So awesome and more amazing than we expected!  The whole time my friend and I were saying, ""can you believe this place?"".  It has everything you need and great little touches to make it feel like you're somewhere special.  Location is fantastic!  We are New Yorkers so we dug the 5-10 minute walk to some cool neighborhoods near by but it was easy to call a cab if we needed to get somewhere quickly.

Christina herself was lovely and very communicative during our stay when we had questions.

We will be back!  Thank you for everything, Christina!"
,,,,,,,,"Cristina and the space were both amazing!  Every detail from the kitchen to the bedroom reflected Cristina's knack for style and quality.  First Class!

Will definitely suggest the place to friends and family that visit us in Austin.

Proximity to restaurants, bars and downtown was excellent.  Cenote especially for breakfast/coffee, maybe the best in the city."
,,,,,,,,"Had an excellent stay.  The apartment was in perfect condition, incredibly clean and with plenty of convenient amenities.  It's also in a great location for getting to a number of favorite spots.  I would absolutely go back."
,,,,,,,,"Our first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic.  Cristina was patient and timely with ALL of my queries and the apartment was just perfect.  It's well appointed, clean, private and such a great location.  It was easy to find and we were able to leave our car at the apartment and walk everywhere downtown; maybe grabbing a short cab ride back if necessary.  The local restaurants and bars were awesome, we liked the Rainey St area the best.
It was better value and probably way better than any hotel room in Austin & I wouldn't hesitate to stay here next time I am in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful apartment, so thoughtfully stocked and decorated, and a great location.  We were able to walk everywhere and loved getting to explore the city. Enjoyed my stay immensely and would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"This was a lovely, well-appointed, and thoughtfully stocked place to stay.  Cristina made everything easy and was very friendly and welcoming.  The location was convenient, as well.  I highly recommend staying here when you're in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"I had a lovely stay in this beautifully decorated apartment.  I was attending a conference at a hotel across from the convention center and found the location to be really convenient.  I walked to and from the conference during the day and then cabbed it back at night (even a bike cab one night!).

The place had everything I needed - really comfortable bedding, fabulous shower, kitchen supplies, internet access - and thoughtful considerations like delicious coffee, an umbrella, walk-in closet with some hangers, and austin-specific books and literature.

The hosts provided timely and detailed information before my trip and good tips when I met them in person.  I enjoyed meeting them.  "
,,,,,,,,"The place is brand-new and totally private and secluded. With lots of light and very easy access. It's a very short walk to the conference center and downtown areas. There's a great cafe for breakfast just 2 blocks away.

It is beautifully furnished and has every convenience you could need. I'm very glad I stayed here and not at a hotel. I'd highly recommend it to anyone visiting Austin."
13380379,4.5,10,10,9,10,10,10,Both Matthew and Molly were very attentive and quick to respond to all messages. It was a very charming place to stay and in a great location.

,,,,,,,,"personal note on door, everything exactly as advertised"
,,,,,,,," We have found a jewel in Austin.   This lovely home has got it goinâ€™ on!  Comfortable and conveniently located within walking distance of a grocery store, nice restaurants and sweet little shops.  We were delighted to walk in and immediately feel the positive vibes that reside there.  The deck was adjacent to a secluded slice of forest, perfect for drinking a morning cup of tea.  Matthewâ€™s instructions for arrival were easy and precise.  He made sure we were settled and had everything we needed.   We will be back for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"Matt was great, he responded quickly to any questions we had. House was well kept and in a nice quiet neighborhood. Would rent that house again. "
,,,,,,,,"Matthew was so responsive and helpful before, during and after our stay. Any questions we had, he was able to answer within an hour, which was super helpful! The neighborhood is really quiet and has some great cafes, a grocery store and restaurants. It was the perfect place to stay for ACL since we were able to walk to the venue. "
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8133062,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,This is a beautiful house in a lovely Austin neighborhood.  A very comfortable environment for our family Christmas.  Nearby coffee and dining spots were superb.  Nathan was an attentive host with good taste.  We'd love to stay in his place again.

,,,,,,,,"Nathan was a great host! He replied promptly to my questions, offered suggestions for dining and was flexible working with our last min stay request. The place is accurately described and as pictured. Quiet, quirky neighborhood that's very ""Austin."" :) Good location, we wouldn't mind another stay here in the future. "

Great location and wonderful home. Incredibly cozy and a great place to put our heads down and work for a few weeks, just like we wanted!

We didn't want to leave. Nathan went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed, plus some really thoughtful extras."
,,,,,,,,Very nice part of Austin to stay in.  Very nice two bedroom house.  Highly recommend.

,,,,,,,,House located on a gorgeous leafy street that made for a real Austin experience. Nathan was great to work with - we even locked ourselves out and he managed to sort us out with a new key through his neighbors (this was a lifesaver). Austin is awesome.
,,,,,,,,"The house was perfectly charming and just as pictured. We enjoyed the neighborhood because it was close enough to get anywhere we wanted to go, and Nathan had great suggestions for places nearby. The big windows in the bedroom were probably my favorite part. Perfect lighting for 4 girls to do their makeup with the big mirror ;) The speaker situation was also crucial!"
,,,,,,,,Great! So clean. Really beautiful home. Lock box made it easy to get in and out. Nathan accommodated a late check out.
,,,,,,,,"Our group LOVED this house! It was the perfect size, in the perfect location. Couldn't be happier! The house looks exactly like it does in the pictures.

Nathan was an awesome host, and thank you for letting us stay in your home!"

Very clear instructions on getting the key, wifi etc.. we didn't have any questions for Nathan, everything was straightforward."
,,,,,,,,"Great experience! Nathan was super responsive to any questions prior to our stay. We had no issues while there. I was a little nervous that it would be too small for us, but we had 6 ladies stay comfortably. The house is in a great location, very clean, warm and welcoming. I would gladly stay at Georgia's house again.  Thanks Nathan!"
,,,,,,,,"Nathan's home was beautiful and wonderfully located in Austin. We were able to walk or quickly Uber to a variety of places including Barton Springs pool, fun neighborhood restaurants, and 6th street/downtown. Nathan was easy to reach all weekend by text when we had a question. Would definitely recommend this listing or stay here again! "
,,,,,,,,"My stay was great.  Nathan's home is the perfect place to get a feel for what living in one of Austin's older neighborhoods would be like. The place has many original details (original wooden trim, sash windows, plank floors, etc.) and just the right amount of upgrades. I loved the comfortable furniture, great collection of books, great kitchen tools, fast Wi-fi, lovely linens, front and back gardens, and huge back deck where I was able to get a good amount of work done. Additionally, every room was spotless and Nathan was a great communicator. Thanks for sharing your lovely home, Nathan!"
,,,,,,,,"Beautiful spot, great location. Walk anywhere in the city. Home has a rear deck and a fine kitchen for cooking. Would definitely stay at again!"
,,,,,,,,"Nathan's home is a great place to stay. We came in for a family event with our three young girls and were welcomed with a note and delighted to find the home exactly as pictured on the listing. Fresh linens, plenty of towels.

,,,,,,,,"Staying at Nathan's lovely home in old Austin made for a perfect family Thanksgiving.  The house and grounds are amazing--spacious, comfortable, welcoming--unfortunately it rained and we were unable to use the back deck.  Would love to come again and bring a couple of girlfriends for a ladies weekend.  It's always nice to see the pics online and then see the exact images in real life.  Nathan was very quick to respond to inquiries; highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,Georgia's House is a very cute bungalow near 6th and MOPAC. We were very comfortable in the house and our host Nathan was very responsive to our needs. My friends and I really liked to proximity to the hiking trails at Sculpture Falls and to downtown attractions. Thanks for a great weekend in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"For a group of roadtripping Brits, this was exactly what we were looking for - clean & spacious, good-sized King and queen beds, great location ($6ish uber to 6th St, just off the Mopac Expressway), fast wifi, TV with an active Netflix account, and a fridge half-stocked with goodies. Quiet neighbourhood & driveway are also pluses. "
,,,,,,,,This place was awesome! Location location location - everything was 5 minutes away. We had a blast in Austin with our brand new twin daughters and Georgia's House was a big part of it. Five stars on cleanliness and accessibility. Loved the aesthetics and the energy in the house. Nathan was easy to get in touch with and responded quickly to our messages. We will be staying here again (soon). 
,,,,,,,,"Clean, great location, and Nathan was quick to respond to any texts I sent his way. He even brought us some extra blankets. Would recommend highly, and would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Easy check-in, awesome location. Easy access to Mopac if you need to travel away from downtown and it is an easy Uber/Lyft ride to Campus/6th St./Rainey St.

House exactly as described. Shame it rained all weekend as I would've loved to have breakfast on the patio! Beds were very comfortable, awesome Pottery Barn sheets."
,,,,,,,,Nathan is a terrific host. He made it easy to check in and had the place ready for us. We knew Austin very well and that this was a great area to stay.  But we were still blown away by the quality of this house
,,,,,,,,"We had a perfect stay at Georgia's House and Nathan was a great host all around. Excellent, easy communication throughout and such a quaint house in one of my favorite Austin neighborhoods. It was quiet, clean, tastefully decorated, well appointed with everything we needed and the beds were HEAVEN with soft linens and the most comfortable pillows I have ever slept on. I highly recommend this property! Thanks again for such a fantastic stay. Will definitely stay here again upon return to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Great house, great neighborhood, great host. Really enjoyed our stay. Would definitely bnb again!"
,,,,,,,,"Nathan was very attentive and responsive. We never had any questions which weren't answered immediately. Great house, great area, great experience!!
Highly recommended. "
,,,,,,,,This was an amazing stay! We went down to Austin for my birthday and this house was so well located and fun! There were tons of restaurants nearby so we didn't have to drive anywhere. We enjoyed going on walks down the street and we enjoyed just sitting outside in the backyard because it was so peaceful. The house was adorable and the wood floors were perfect! The beds are so comfy and spacious! It is also a close drive to the bars down 6th street! I loved the privacy we had as well! Nathan trusted us enough and gave us enough information to navigate the house and area. Nathan was readily available for any type of questions. We did not want to leave the house at all. It was a relaxing getaway. Nice quiet area to spend time with friends and just relax but close enough to go visit some bars as well as unique restaurants. Also had fast Internet and a tv with netflix. Backyard was the place to have breakfast and dinner at.
13547174,,10,10,10,,,,"Loved staying at this beautiful modern home with a family feel.  Best part was 3 full spacious & clean bathrooms & the gourmet kitchen.  Plenty of space for parking.  Safe neighborhood, great location for ACL, Zilker Park, & downtown.  "

,,,,,,,,"Great place, convenient location!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying in Ryan's place was perfect for our Thanksgiving trip to Austin. The location is right at the center of just about anything you could want to do in Austin. 

Thanks Ryan we enjoyed the condo and downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,Great apartment. Excellent location and service. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan gave great instructions about the property, and the location was perfect. "
,,,,,,,,Excellent location. Easy walk to a lot of local spots. Plenty of room for our group. Would recommend to anyone with a slightly large group. Can't beat the value
,,,,,,,,Good location 
,,,,,,,,This is a great apartment! Comfortable for 6 adults and a baby and very centrally located for all kinds of fun in Austin!  Hosts were extremely accommodating!
,,,,,,,,Their preparations prior to arrival were thorough and they were responsive in our last minute questions and requests.
,,,,,,,,"VERY professional and responsive host.  The place itself was very nice and well kept.  The location is central to everything one would want to do in Austin.  The amenities are limited (only a small pool) but being located in the heart of the action, they are not really necessary.  HIGHLY recommend this place particularly for larger parties as it is quite spacious."
,,,,,,,,"Great location downtown!  Easy access, comfortable, clean.  Ryan was very responsive and helpful. Would certainly stay here again if I'm back in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"So incredibly responsive and accommodating. We had three cars, and they were able to secure an additional two parking spaces for us fairly quickly. Very communicative and quick to respond to any issues we had. Perfect location, walking distance to almost everywhere we needed to go, which was especially helpful now that Austin doesn't have Uber. Very nicely decorated, the beds were incredibly comfortable. I would DEFINITELY recommend this condo. "
,,,,,,,,My group loved our stay here! Couldn't beat the location for downtown Austin. It was a lifesaver to have access to free parking for our rental car. We stayed here for my bachelorette party and it was the perfect size for a group of nine girls. There were a lot of little touches that made it feel like a home and a few more that made it feel a little nicer than home. None of us had ever seen a TV over a bed before! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location and nice apartment, exactly as advertised. Lack of communication before the trip is what made this experience stressful."
,,,,,,,,"Thank you for hosting team FMG CPA.

Great downtown location.

Trish "
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location! Nice spot, very clean! The owner was super nice and quick to respond or help in any way. Def recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location, and amazingly comfortable! We had 4 professionals staying for a conference, and we will definitely be booking the same place when we come back! "
,,,,,,,,Great place. Great location. And Ryan was able to accommodate us with an early check in. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location on 4th street - walkable or quick taxi to most areas of town you'd want to visit. Clean apartment, comfortable beds. Exactly as advertised."
,,,,,,,,"This a very central located place, everything just worked out fine for us. Next year we'll be back for ChefConf 2017."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was great, exactly as advertised. It was right where you'd want to be in Austin. I'd highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was very accommodating and quickly responded to all emails. Austin is beautiful place and the condo is equally just as beautiful. It's very conveniently located to downtown Austin, only two blocks from 6th street where the night life is at. We loved the decor in the condo and the fact that we were able to walk to 6th Street, Rainey, and Town Lake.

However, there were a few things that were not functioning properly. Both of the air mattresses seemed to have leaks. They were deflated within just a few hours of use. Also, the barstool chairs in the kitchen are wobbley, but they seem to be usable.

Aside from those little mishaps, the condo is in a great location if you're up for walking around the city. We also took the public transportation from the airport for $1.75 and it dropped us off right in front of the condo. 

I would recommend this place to a friend, but make sure you inquire about the air mattresses if you plan to have guests sleeping on them! Overall it was clean and well kept.

Thank you again for the stay, Ryan. We thoroughly enjoyed Austin!"
,,,,,,,,My experience was as described.  This was a nice blast from the past for me as I used to live in this building complex when I was in college 20 years ago.  Boy is Austin different now.  Great location remains the same.
,,,,,,,,The condo was perfect.  Plenty of space for our six group (6 women) and the amenities were great.  The location was as good as we could have asked for. 
,,,,,,,,Ryan was great and let us check-in early. The condo is very conveniently located. 
,,,,,,,,Great Place. We booked it to house our team that was in town for meetings in Austin. Loved the place. Awesome location!!!
,,,,,,,,We had an amazing time this past weekend in Austin! What a great unit and host!! Our entire group loved the experience.. Thanks again!
,,,,,,,,"I recently stayed here for a weekend and everyone in my party of 7 thoroughly enjoyed it.  The accommodations are very comfortable and have everything you need.  The location is what really makes this place stand out.  We never had to use a taxi or uber once in three days.  Everything is in walking distance!
Also, Ryan is great to work with and he will assist you with just about anything. - Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Good experience overall. The location was GREAT but the place was smaller than I expected.  The doors didn't have locks, which became an issue at times."
,,,,,,,,"Condo was clean and well maintained.  Perfect location in downtown Austin.  Property manager was very attentive and helpful.  Will definitely be back!
"
,,,,,,,,"Our experience was wonderful. Ryan was very helpful, providing lots of recommendations for restaurants, tourist spots, bars, etc. His associate Thomas was also very helpful in getting us an early check-in. The apartment met all of our needs. There were 10 of us, and it never felt cramped. The decorations were great, and the location could not have been better.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great location for convention center and activities on 6th and Rainey St.  Ryan is a great host for communications...quick to answer questions before arrival and during our stay.  Space was adequate, clean, well decorated.  Thanks for a great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's condo is fantastic. It's SUPER close to the convention center and all of the fun things in downtown Austin. It was clean, nicely decorated, and a great place to unwind after a long day in Austin. We will book here again in the future, for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, Ryan offered clear communication throughout our experience and someone was always available for any issues that came up."
,,,,,,,,What a perfect location.  This place is an easy walk to 6th street and Rainey Street.  The home looks just like the pictures.  Very nice with everything you need for the stay.  Would definitely visit again.
,,,,,,,,"This place was fantastic and perfect for what we needed. It is literally the closest you cold possibly get to the Austin Convention center which was great for our team that was there all week.

Everything was clean and our whole crew loved the beds. 

Will be a go to for any trips to Austin for sure. "
,,,,,,,,"Accurate description, great location, and Ryan is very responsive."
,,,,,,,,"Our group of five enjoyed our stay. We're hoping to stay here again in a few years when our convention rotates back to Austin. Great location (right across the street from the convention center, and a couple blocks from the 6th street entertainment district), clean, and comfortable.  The beds were very comfortable as well. 

The hosts responded quickly to queries.

Biggest downside was generally slow wifi (~1Mbps down/0.08 up), and was particularly flaky in the loft. "
,,,,,,,,"This was the most perfect weekend! A beautiful apartment, worked perfectly for our group. Everything was immaculate and welcoming. Thank you so much to Ryan for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"The six of us had a great time staying at this condo. The listing was accurate, and there was more than enough room for each couple to have their own space. The common area was a bit small, but the location was great--just a few minutes by foot to lots of stuff to do in downtown Austin. Ryan was also very accommodating. He responded immediately when we requested storing our bags for a few hours after checkout. Thanks Ryan!"
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience at this Condo.  It was one of four that we rented for a large reunion.  Ryan was extremely responsive and helpful.  10 out of 10!
,,,,,,,,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it was wonderful. Hopefully my future bookings will be as good as this one. The condo was clean, spacious, and the instructions Ryan gave us were very clear and concise so we had no issues entering and leaving the condo, finding the garage gate clicker, etc. The parking spot was close to the unit and to our surprise there was plenty of street parking. It was pretty cheap especially compared to San Francisco prices! The condo was located conveniently near 6th street so there were plenty of bars within walking distance. Ryan, the host was very responsive and answered us immediately if we had any questions."
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience staying at Ryan's condo! It's very spacious and clean. The condo is conveniently located-right next door to the convention center and just a few blocks from Rainey St. We needed two parking spaces and Ryan was able to accommodate us which was great because parking is very expensive downtown! Ryan also gave us a bottle of wine.
,,,,,,,,"A little different this time around. I was here for work with 2 co-workers rather than for pleasure. The place is well decorated, comfortable, the showers with great water pressure & they took care of the basics.  It's hard to beat the location with a parking space.  The key less entry made it so easy to get in and out with the 3 of us.  The hosts were extremely responsive, professional, provided really good recommendations & were willing to get the apartment ready for an early check-in.  They send you a long list of instructions, so everything is pretty much answered for you - it's easy. 

But if you are staying here for work, keep in mind, the loft space has 2 queen beds but it's totally open, both bathroom are located downstairs, and the living room is a bit small.  It made it difficult to work at the table for 6 of us.  I would definitely stay here again but not for work."
,,,,,,,,Ryan and Thomas did a fantastic job prepping the apartment for us! Absolutely every question was answered in their detailed information sheet -- we didn't struggle with anything. The home itself is VERY clean and well supplied with everything we may have needed over the weekend. The location of the condo is perfect -- secure in its own gated complex. We were able to walk to several things in our itinerary (the famous Rainey street and Historic 6th street are very close). It is also very easy to get to and from the airport. I would definitely recommend this place!
,,,,,,,,"Ryan's condo was absolutely perfect for attending SXSWEco at the Austin Convention Center.  It is literally across the street from the Center.  Checking in was as easy as it could be, and the condo was well-appointed with everything my teammates and I needed for our stay.  I highly recommend this location!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was exactly as advertised.  The location can not be beat as you are basically nestled between east 6th street and Rainey Districts.  Access was ideal, particularly if you have a car."
,,,,,,,,"Couldn't have had a better experience with this Airbnb. It was 5 of us girls for a weekend in Austin and the location was absolutely amazing. The space itself was beautiful and extremely spacious. There were 4 beds and 2 full baths, all amenities. It was honestly perfect for us. Communication with the host was excellent as well. 5 stars!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great communicative host, great location. clean spacious apartment minutes away from 6th St. Would 100% stay here again!  "
,,,,,,,,The place was exactly as described. Very nice and very clean. Indications were very clear. We had a great time there!
,,,,,,,,Great spot! Will be staying again next year!! 
,,,,,,,,PERFECT location!! This condo was everything we could have asked for. Amazing restaurants and bars all around. Ryan and his team did an excellent job helping us with everything we needed. I would definitely recommend this condo. 
,,,,,,,,Best place I've stayed at in Austin. Ryan was extremely accommodating and responsive. All around great experience.
,,,,,,,,"Great host, great space, and great location.  Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,Nice place and great location.  Close to everything in downtown Austin and plenty of space for the 8 of us who stayed there for a weekend.  Ryan was responsive when we had an issue (another car in the assigned spot - not his fault) and took care of us.  Highly recommended and would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Dealing with Ryan was incredibly convenient.  We rented this apartment for a convention and four of us from my company stayed there.  It was right across the street from the convention center and we saved a LOT of money.  Ryan was very friendly.  In fact we had originally had booked another apartment, but then had to extend a night. The original apartment wasn't available so we had to switch to another unit.  Ryan made the transition extremely easy.  The apartment itself was also great and we would definitely rent again."
,,,,,,,,"It was great! I was staying here for my wedding with my groomsmen. The place was perfect, we were in a great part of downtown and the accommodations were great. The apartment is updated and has a very comfortable feel. If I come back to Austin I would definitely stay here again. The hosts were great and very helpful. We needed another parking place and they helped us find them very quickly, I was very pleased."
,,,,,,,,We had a great time in Austin over the 4th of July weekend with 3 other couples. The location was great and walking distance to the firework display. 
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Ryan's place with eight of my girlfriends for a reunion weekend. We loved the apartment - it was clean, had lots of space and had lots of towels, cleaning supplies, etc. Great location as well - walking distance to a lot of the places we went or a short Uber. "
,,,,,,,,The condo was absolutely beautiful - even better than reflected in the pictures. It was central to everything and was an extremely comfortable home base. Ryan was very responsive during the process. I wouldn't change a thing!
,,,,,,,,Ryan made me feel welcome and provided a lot of information about the city and surrounding area. The location of the condo was very convenient and we were able to easily walk to numerous attractions/restaurants. The place was clean and I found it to be just as advertised. The complex got loud at night on a couple occasions due to the partying of other units but that was our only complaint.
,,,,,,,,Genial. UbicaciÃ³n perfecta. Es exactamente como aparece en las fotos. Camas super cÃ³modas. Si volviese a Austin me quedarÃ­a en el mismo apartamento sin dudarlo un segundo.
,,,,,,,,Our stay at Ryan's condo was amazing. The location couldn't be beat for accessibility to anywhere downtown. The unit was beautiful and clean when we arrived. We had an issue with our A/C not working and Ryan and his team were on it in no time. We couldn't have picked a better place for our trip.
,,,,,,,,"The condo was nice and clean! Very true to pictures. The location was great and we only had to Uber a couple times. There are great restaurants around that you can just walk to. The house was fully stocked with plenty of shampoo, body wash, paper towels, etc.  It was great! The welcome email I received after booking was really thorough and helpful for activities as well!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a great rental for a group. Plenty of room for everyone, excellent location and easy to get in and out thanks to all of the set up and information on the front end from Ryan. I had a slight hiccup with another renter staying in the complex when I parked in the wrong parking spot - but a quick call to the number Ryan provided and we got it straightened out in seconds. Super helpful and everything that was presented. Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"The space was good for our purposes. Noise definitely travels as the walls are quiet thin. The unit itself only has the basics, but they were fine / enough for our stay.  "
,,,,,,,,Great apartment great location great host. True to advertisement.
,,,,,,,,"We made this reservation to celebrate a friend's and my birthday and we had the best possible experience.  Every single aspect of our reservation, check-in, stay and check-out were handled impeccably by Ryan, Jared and Thomas.

Jared was our contact during our stay, and he went out of his way more than once to make our stay as convenient, seamless and easy as possible.  From offering to store our bags prior to check-in, delivering them to the unit while we were out and about during the day, allowing late check-out before we flew out, and his general availability to answer questions and provide recommendations throughout our stay, I can't say enough about how tremendous a job Jared did.

The condo looked great, sleeps 4-8 people comfortably (maybe even 10, if you use the airbeds) and had plenty of amenities and conveniences.

If you are looking for a clean, nice, comfortable, convenient place to stay in a fantastic location, for a great price, with outstanding hosts, I strongly suggest you look no further than here.

Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,"The host made us feel welcome and all the information he provided was EXTREMELY helpful. He clued us in on how to check-in, where to hang out, and how to get back to the airport. The unit itself was incredible. We were easily accomodated and the location was great!"
,,,,,,,,Great place and location. Very clean and great decor!
,,,,,,,,"Listing and pictures held true to what was promised. The unit appears to be used exclusively for airbnb, and was very clean and we'll maintained. 

Moreover, the property manager, Thomas, was extremely responsive to his guests and accommodating to various questions we had. 

Overall great airbnb experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was great, the lock system was excellent as there was no messing around with collecting or dropping off keys. The place is truly swanky and very central. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend anyone visiting Austin to use this condo. Keep up the good work.   "
,,,,,,,,"Our group of 7 had a great stay at the condo this January. Plenty of sleeping room, and the beds were very comfortable (memoryfoam I think). The common room/living space was a little tight and oddly shaped, but we made it work as we were mostly out and about exploring Austin. It just wouldn't be great if you really wanted to lounge and cook dinners with a large group at the condo.  The location of the place is amazing--extremely central and within walking distance (so long as the weather is nice!)  of most areas. We didn't have a car, so this was extremely valuable! The condo is right across from a big hotel so there were always lots of cabs right in front and also a Starbucks in the hotel lobby! The check-in/out process was very easy and Ryan and team were super efficient and responsive to our questions, accommodated a late checkout, etc. Overall a great stay! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"So first off - I have to say that Austin was my favorite domestic trip I've been on. There were a few key reasons why this property helped:

1. The location couldn't be better. It is one and a half blocks from ""dirty"" 6th street - the college bar scene. Franklins (the famous BBQ) and west 6th street (the bars for us in our late 20s) are within walking distance on a nice day (10-15 min walk). You also get a parking space to drive to other, farther away attractions.
2. The space COMFORTABLY fits 8 people. The air mattresses are small (that fit 2 more), but they definitely work. 
3. The condo is stocked with shampoo, bodywash, coffee, etc. It makes the experience that much easier. 
4. The place is a beautiful loft - complete with wifi, tvs, etc. 
5. Did I mention the LOCATION! It really can't be beat. And the price is very good compared to local hotels.

Ryan and his property manager, Thomas, were more than amenable. I had all the information I needed prior to arriving in Austin. Thomas was very quick to answer my calls and accommodated my group tremendously. They gave my group our space but were there when we needed them. 

One thing to note - the rooms don't lock. Just so you know :). 

I will also say this - my group had a few people that, no matter how many times you told them, would not be quiet after the ""quiet hours"" (10pm - 7am). I would say that, as a result, we were a loud group. There are tenants that live full-time in this complex, but they were all very gracious and respectful if we were being too loud. 

Overall, this place is a 5 star rental for sure. I would recommend it to really any larger groups. If you come when Brazos Hall (two blocks down) has an event, I would recommend going to that - we had the best NYE there!!"
,,,,,,,,"The location is excellent! Perfectly situated downtown and it's easy to get in/out of the condo. That being said, some of the windows do not lock so we were at times worried about leaving our belongings there. I did not have any interaction with Ryan - as the email he sent prior to our arrival was self explanatory. The place is a lot smaller in real life and the loft upstairs is just one room with two double beds. My only other complaint would be the shower downstairs does not drain which is gross especially if you need to take showers one after another. The place is all about its location. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan and his properties are a fantastic choice for your stay in Austin.  Take it from a former resident - the location can't be beat.  Combine that with the charm of a well-decorated place with hotel-like amenities, and you've got yourself a perfect rental!

As a first-time Airbnb renter, I was skeptical of the process, but Ryan put my mind at ease immediately.  He was very responsive to communications and questions pre-booking, sent a very detailed list of instructions for everything we needed to know for our trip, and and his team immediately followed up with answers to our last-minute questions just before our stay.

My only complaint is that the trip ended too soon, but I'm afraid there's nothing Ryan could've done about that - else I'm sure he would've tried!"
,,,,,,,,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Railyard during the Austin Film Festival. Location was ideal. Apartment was comfortable. And Ryan was a dependable, reliable host. "
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was always in communication along with his employees. They addressed a kitchen concern very quickly.  I appreciate that we had direct contact numbers.  The place is decorated great and it was awesome there was an air mattress already in the unit!  

I loved Austin. The location of this apartment is fantastic and they are very thorough about places to check out and sightsee!  Overall we had an amazing weekend! "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Ryan's loft was fantastic. We came to Austin for a weekend with a group of 8 and fit very comfortably in the space. The loft itself is beautiful and had everything we needed - plus the location was perfect. Ryan and Thomas were extremely helpful both before and during our stay, providing recommendations and assistance when we needed it. I would absolutely recommend this location if you're looking for a great place to stay in an ideal location."
,,,,,,,,"Location was fantastic. It's not a particularly large space, but it's well-equipped, reasonably priced, and absolutely spotless. We fit 8 very comfortably. Would definitely stay there again."
2473246,,10,10,10,10,10,10,"One word can describe my experience while staying at Catherine's place: AMAZING ! From beginning to end Catherine was responsive, helpful, caring, intuitive and down right hospitable. The house is beautiful and full of fun stuff to do and look at. Plenty of space for you and your guest. I hosted my family's Christmas dinner here and all everyone could talk about ( besides the wonderful food) was how wonderful the house was. We stayed during the winter so we didn't have much use for the pool...but it sure did look inviting and comfortable. We had a small maintenance issue during our stay and Catherine hopped on it and got it resolved quickly, even providing some one to wait for the service technician so we could leave and finish enjoying our visit to Austin. Catherine truly made this place a home away from home and we'll definitely be returning.  "
,,,,,,,,"Catherine and her husband were great and very hospitable.  They have an amazing home close to the downtown area with everything you need.  We were lucky enough to spend 12 days there.  

We had an issue with a camera battery that caught fire and caused a small amount of damage.  Luckily, nobody was hurt and their smoke alarms work great.  Catherine was very understanding and we took care of the damage bill.

I would definitely stay here again.  "

Jacob was also quick to respond to our queries throughout our stay and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Comfortable for 3 people! Will stay here again 10/10! "
,,,,,,,,Great stay!
,,,,,,,,Place was as depicted in photos and Jacob was great in communication. Accessing the unit was a breeze as Jacob made it very easy and he was always quick to respond. 
,,,,,,,,"Jacob is great! Very communicative and easy to coordinate with. I truly appreciate everything he did to help make the stay easy.

Still, there's a disconnect between the photos and reality. They're all technically accurate, but the feel of the space is different. Stay here because of the location and a nice overall space, but don't assume it's as polished as presented. Use (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Street view to see the exterior & temper expectations to avoid disappointment."
,,,,,,,,Great location and apartment! Made getting around downtown Austin very easy and convenient. Perfect place to stay for a casual weekend. Host was very accommodating.
,,,,,,,,"Jacob's place was more than we could of asked for. Everything was ready to go when we got there and if i had any questions, he was always readily available to respond. Not to be crammed into a single hotel room for 4 days was the best part. Cab rides were a good price from his house to downtown, it worked out perfectly for us. Thank you Jacob!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was neat and tidy, and the location provides easy access to UT and the interstate. "
,,,,,,,,"Jacob's place is a nice quiet spot in a cool neighborhood, and only a short ride from the liveliest parts of downtown. The place itself is roomy and clean. Jacob was also great with communicating anytime I reached out to him. We spent 5 days there with no problems."
,,,,,,,,I was looking for a place near downtown that would be convenient to the ACL fest shuttles.  This location fit the bill. We were able to walk to the shuttle (about 16 blocks total).
,,,,,,,,It was the perfect location for walking to campus. The place was clean and Jacob was easy to reach and helpful. 
,,,,,,,,Jacob was easy to communicate with ahead of my arrival. The accommodation was clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable. The A/C and ceiling fan was welcome in the heat. Jacob also was flexible with my departure time since I was coming from a conference morning session on the UT campus. I felt I saved money compared to the nearby Hotel Ella. Definitely worth considering Jacob's place if you don't need the fancy wait staff of a hotel.
,,,,,,,,"Host has great communication, is a very nice person, and was amenable to all my requests. Superb location."
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Jacob was a great host. Super clean place. Great, Great Location! Absolutely enjoyed my stay. Jacob was easy to communicate and was active. Quiet place and walking distance everywhere in the city. I recommend getting a bike pass if wanting to explore the city. "
,,,,,,,,"It was a great location minutes away from many good restaurants, bars, and tourism attractions. The place was clean and the host helpful. We visited the Austin bat bridge, hope outdoor gallery, Barton springs pool, and many other fun places all located less than a 7 minute drive."
,,,,,,,,"I had a fantastic stay at Jacob's place. 

Location, location, location; it could not be more perfect.

The place was clean, the neighborhood quiet. 10/10 would stay here again. "

,,,,,,,,"Hello world! Colleen's place is very cozy and clean. The price is great and you really can't beat the location: right next to the river trail, taco joint, and Thoms market (awesome breakfast burritos). It was easy to walk/bike/and ""ride-Austin"" to places. Colleens bed was extremely comfy!!! Highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Colleen was a great host and her apartment was fantastic.  great location, amazing taco joint close by, and ten min walk to downtown."
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay!  Colleen 's place was perfectly situated for our trip and we were able to walk to a lot of the places we needed to go.  We didn't meet in person but she was great with tips for getting around.  There's a Thom's Market right in front of her building which was super convenient for grabbing drinks and snacks.  
"
,,,,,,,,"
Everything was exactly as described. Very clean and very comfortable. Amazing leather couch to relax on and probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! So close to South Congress and Rainey Street for nightlife/restaurants.  So easy to communicate with Colleen as well. HIGHLY recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,Great clean apartment in an excellent location. 
2426905,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Great experience. Very smooth arrival. The apartment is comfortable yet intimate for our group, so it was great being able to be together. "
,,,,,,,,A great location! Great place to stay for an even better price! Our group was able to enjoy all that Austin had to offer.
,,,,,,,,Bigger than it looks in the pictures. Convenient and safe location. Perfect for 9 of us on a bachelor party.
,,,,,,,,Great spot!  Great location!  Highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan & Thomas were extremely accommodating and very responsive. The complex was centrally located to everywhere we wanted to be for a weekend getaway in Austin. Apartment was clean, spacious, comfortable and quiet from the other apartments. 

They really try everything to make this a comfortable visit. Thanks for the fun stay!
"
,,,,,,,,"Both the place and Ryan were fantastic. Great communication, was flexible and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in us having a great time. He had flown out of town the morning before we arrived but arranged for another person to meet us who was also incredibly helpful. Great apartment and great host.
The couldn't fault the apartment, well equipped, clean and in an awesome location."
,,,,,,,,Great for conferences! Literally steps away from the convention center and makes you feel like you are home. Ryan was awesome and responded to our every needed. Would highly recommend. 
,,,,,,,,"Great stay! Group of 8 went to Austin for a one night stay. This place was perfect for us! Plenty of room, comfy beds and clean! Walking distance from pretty much everything! Ryan was a great host, responding to all my questions quickly! Our group drove up in two separate cars and Thomas the property manager was able to get us two spots in their gated parking area.   Very nice of him! All around it was a great experience! Would definitely recommend this spot for a large group! We will be back for a longer visit next time and will definitely stay here!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place and location. If you're heading to Austin, this is a great spot to stay."
,,,,,,,,Really fantastic location that's hard to beat in Austin! Place was super nice and clean as well. Would recommend staying here!
,,,,,,,,"When we arrived, the place was missing an air mattress pump and I was pleasantly surprised how quickly a property representative came out to the location to supply us. Many thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Ryan & Thomas were great hosts! They provided a ton of really great information on what to do & see in Austin prior to our arrival. They were extremely helpful and responsive when I messaged them through out our trip with questions. They were also accommodating with early check-in and late check-out and the location was unbeatable! It is within walking distance to 6th street & Rainey (a little further walk, but we did it easily). It is also right on the corner where the Airport flyer drops off and picks up, so easy arrival and departure since Uber/Lyft are not available. The apartment fit 7 girls very comfortably. It was clean and exactly how the pictures look. The beds were super comfy! I would recommend staying here if you have a large group!"
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location. Awesome place to stay. Really need complex, very convenient having the pool so close. Quick walk to 6th street. Starbucks right across the street. Very clean. Easy check in process. "
,,,,,,,,The listing description was accurate. We had 10 women who all slept comfortably. Location was great and close to everything. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was easy to communicate with and patient with me during a small hiccup with an inaccurate email address I had provided where the check-in information had been sent. He was quick to get me the information I needed. 

The place was absolutely perfect for our double-bachelorette party. We were at full capacity with 10 girls but found the space to comfortably fit everyone without feeling cramped. The location was perfect, everything you need within walking distance. The complex pool was a favorite (even though it's a little small), it was the perfect place to go cool off after adventuring around Austin in the 100Â° weather. We had an absolute blast. I highly recommend this space for larger groups.  

Highlights of our trip included Rainey Street, Cooper's BBQ and river tubing (MUST DO). We arranged one through ATXcursions that picked us up 2 blocks from the apartment. "
,,,,,,,,"This was an amazing experience! First time I used Air BnB and Ryan made everything so easy and comforting! He answered all my questions and help me feel at ease.  The space is perfect! We had a bachlorette party here with eight ladies and didn't have one problem. Ryan even answered a late night question about the AC (how nice!!). The apartment was very clean and everything in the place was of great quality. I felt as if he place was bigger in person than it appears in the pictures. The location is the best part! It's right in the heart of downtown. We walked almost everywhere. The pool is super cute too! A few other groups were there and we all ended up hanging out together and playing games. I couldn't be more happy with Ryan, the apartment and experience. Thank you!!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time! The location is perfect and there was a lot of bed space available for our group. The furniture was comfortable, but there isn't a ton of space in the living area for the group. Ryan was very responsive to messages on Airbnb and to text messages. We were able to get a light replaced right after letting him know."
,,,,,,,,Rented the place for a bachelorette weekend and was very pleased! The location was absolutely perfect and Ryan made everything super easy. Thanks Ryan!
,,,,,,,,"My friends and I had a great time staying here!  Everything that we wanted to do was within walking distance as described.  From check in to check out, everything was very easily accomplished.  Ryan communicated everything promptly prior to our stay and it provided for a very relaxing stay in Austin.  I would recommend this stay to anyone interested in checking out Austin!

Thanks Ryan for a great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was amazing and this unit was perfect for our needs. Location could have not been any better and we'd definitely use Ryan again for future stays! They were extremely helpful when we had a minor issue getting in so we'd recommend the Silver Screen Cinema, Ryan, and his team any day!"
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely loved the location! The host was super communicative, and the place was even better than the description. Would absolutely recommend to a friend. "
,,,,,,,,"
The apartment was located in the heart of town, within walking distance of  everything you can imagine, shopping, restaurants, grocery storesâ€¦.  The apartment was clean, and had everything we needed to cook breakfast every morning. Austin is a beautiful city and this was the perfect place to call home at the end of every night.  There was a misunderstanding at one point after our departure regarding the apartment, after speaking with Ryan he was quick to clear everything up and immediately eased our anxiety.  We would be happy to stay here again, the apartment was perfect and Ryan was a true gentleman."
,,,,,,,,"Very convenient location, close to most of the venues we were interested in. Many restaurants nearby, liquor store, cvs/711, etc. The apt itself is very nice and clean. We had 10 people and fit comfortably. The water turning cold quickly was a issue but we also had a lot of girls getting ready. Some of the units are rented or owned and so some of the residents in this complex don't necessarily like sharing their space with Airbnb renters. In all, I would definitely recommend this place. Ryan is more than accommodating which makes the stay comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here with 6 other guys for a bachelor party and would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be near 6th St. and/or Rainey- you simply can't beat the location. Short walking distance from so many good bars and restaurants. The space itself fit 7 of us comfortably. The living area is a little tight but the sleeping arrangements were excellent with several beds and beanbags (you shouldn't be spending much time in the condo if you are not sleeping anyway, there are too many great things to do in Austin to waste your time sitting around).

Ryan and Thomas were extremely responsive to all questions and accommodative of all requests. I could not have asked for more from the host.

I will, without a doubt, try to book through Ryan again if I ever find myself in Austin in the future."
,,,,,,,,Great communications before the visit. Apartment was right next to the convention center and close to 6th street. Perfect location. Plenty of room for my group.
,,,,,,,,Being from NYC - we walk everywhere.  I found this really centrally located and walkable to everything.  Some may prefer to take a car (which was like $6 to pretty much anywhere).  The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures and it's great that there are 4 bedrooms (and 6 total beds) so our large group was accommodated well.   Instructions were easy and we had a great stay.
,,,,,,,,Easy access to the place. Easily fit 7 of us for business. Could've been more if we were sharing some beds! Waking distance to many restaurants and some bars. But quick ride to other cool hot spots downtown. 
,,,,,,,,The apartment was wonderful and in the best location in Austin. We had a really really great say. I can't say enough about the location or the apartment. Ryan and Thomas were very accommodating of our departure time and easy to reach out to. Thanks again!
,,,,,,,,We stayed at the Silver Screen Cinema in February for a bachelorette party and it was great! Ryan and Thomas were extremely helpful answering all of my questions leading up to the trip and they were very accommodating. That condo was fantastic and getting in was a very smooth process thanks to our hosts! It was stocked with everything we needed and was very comfortable for our party of 8. It was our first time in Austin so the location was a huge plus! We walked to almost everything and even the things a bit further were only a 10 minute uber ride away! I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone visiting Austin.
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host. The place definitely met expectations and it was wonderful to stay there. 
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was the perfect host. His instructions were clear, and all the information he gave us about what to do in downtown  Austin were great. Not one bad recommendation. 

I would highly recommend using Ryan and this accommodation for any group thinking of travelling to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"I didn't have any communication once we arrived in Austin with Ryan because none was needed. Everything he sent in his welcome email was all we needed. 

Apartment was great and centrally located to everything we wanted to do.

Thanks Ryan!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything was great. Neighborhood, checkin/checkout, cleanliness, etc was all spot on. I can't wait to come back. "
,,,,,,,,Great location and flexible with late check out. Thanks for your help and nice place!
,,,,,,,,Thanks for hosting. Great place in an ideal location.
,,,,,,,,Our family thoroughly enjoyed our holiday stay! Great location and furnishings!  Ryan was extremely responsive to our needs/questions.
,,,,,,,,"Silver Screen was a great place to stay during our event at the Austin Convention Center. The location could not be beat - across the street to ACC and a short walk to 6th Street and Congress! Even better than any main brand hotels. Royal Blue Grocery is just a block away and is a GREAT place to stock up for your stay. The unit is well appointed and the beds are super comfortable. While there's not a plethora of seating in the living room (which you won't need since you're out and about in the great city of Austin), there are many places to sleep (which you WILL need because you've been out and about partying in Austin)! Would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,We had a great experience at this Condo.  It was one of four that we rented for a large reunion.  Ryan was extremely responsive and helpful.  10 out of 10!
,,,,,,,,Amazing condo to stay with a group of 10. Onyx Hotels team were very accommodating. Had a great time and would be happy to stay again.
,,,,,,,,Great place - everything exactly as mentioned in the listing.  Perfect location in Austin
,,,,,,,,Ryan your place was fabulous for the seven of us!  We had s great weekend. It was located with in walking distant of everywhere we wanted to be. We even walked to SOCO!  We had plenty of towels and linens. You need more wine classes!  Thanks!  
,,,,,,,,"This apartment is in an excellent location- very easy to walk to shops, restaurants and nightlife. Because of it's central location, that does mean you can expect the nighttime noise to be loud. The apartment was clean and comfortable, though it was a tight fit for 4 couples to hang out together in the living room. I do think the apartment is in need of a refresh- lots of wear and tear which was most visible in the bathroom and on the walls. The host was great- very responsive to inquiries and was able to let our group check in early and have a late check out. All in all, I would recommend if you have a group and are looking to stay somewhere close to the nightlife."
,,,,,,,,"The location and place was perfect for the 10 people we had. Throughout the process Ryan and Thomas were extremely helpful in accommodating an early arrival and working with us with any questions we had! My only advice to those staying in this condo is to bring towels for showers/pool and we did since we inquired in advance of our stay. We will be back, and stay here again! :)"
,,,,,,,,The Silver Screen Cinema Suite was perfect for our stay. The apartment was just as described and you could not beat the location of the space. Ryan and his team was more than helpful with everything we needed and would highly recommend for a large party stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host and getting into the apartment was a breeze. We received an informative email with everything we needed to know about the apartment and surrounding area. The apartment was perfectly accommodating for our 9 person party and walking distance to everything in downtown Austin is a huge plus. I will definitely be back next time I host a large group in Austin. Thanks Ryan and Thomas! 
,,,,,,,,"The condo was great!  It is in an ideal location, walkable to the convention center and all downtown areas.  The keyless entry was perfect for our group, so we didn't have to keep track of keys.  The unit was clean and we appreciated the toiletries that were provided.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area! "
,,,,,,,,Our group felt welcome. The lollipops were a nice touch. The condo and the neighborhood description were accurate. We enjoyed our stay and were welcomed with smiles from our hosts.
,,,,,,,,"A group of 12 of us rented this place and the Cosmo (right next door). We had a great time. For the apartment themselves - there's an incredible amount of space, great seating areas, fully stocked kitchens, and very comfortable beds/pillows. The location is also superb. It's right off sixth street and only a little farther to Rainey - and close enough to LA barbecue that you could sleep in and still get in line early enough to not have a wait time.

We will definitely stay here again if coming back to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Everyone was extremely responsive, we had an issue with the keycode but Ryan was able to address that right away. Perfect place for a group of 10 and the location was extremely convenient as it was walking distance to most of the places we wanted to go. Starbucks right across the street and restaurants/juicery/yoga studios just as close. They also were able to store our luggage for people with later flights. Projector system was great, just don't forget to bring your own adapter for your Mac computer."
,,,,,,,,The Silver Screen was a great place to stay.  The location was perfect!  Please give my thanks to your team for being readily available to assist us in anyway.
,,,,,,,,"The Silver Screen Cinema Suite was a great place to stay and a good value. Ryan and his team greeted us with a smile and a few beers to welcome us to Austin for the long weekend and quickly came to help after we emailed about a couple of small lighting issues. The projector in the living room didn't work, but we weren't really around enough to need to use it and if we'd asked to get it fixed, I'm sure they would have done so immediately.

The neighborhood is good, though the complex was a bit loud. It might have just been because it was Memorial Day weekend, but there was a lot of noise that came into this unit each night. Two of the bedrooms (and the loft) face the main street, so that definitely was an issue for the folks sleeping in those rooms.

Overall, though, it was a nice, comfortable place to stay and in a great location within easy walking distance of restaurants, bars and shops."
,,,,,,,,The listing and location were all described exactly as we noticed when we arrived. We loved the location and the other tenants were very nice when we passed them in the hallways.
,,,,,,,,Our stay at the Silver Screen was great! We had a crew of 10 girls and had plenty of room. The location was perfect for getting around town. Thomas (property manager) was super responsive in helping us when we had issues with the projector systems. 10/10 for this place!
,,,,,,,,"Location was great, very easy to walk to anything around Austin.  Amount of space for guests were great!!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location in downtown Austin.  Ryan runs a very professional operation with clear communications, easy access to the property, and a clean, well-maintained unit.  Only complaint was the painfully slow Wi-Fi."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience and loved the space. It was perfect for the four of us. We didn't spend much time here (unfortunately) since we were so close to Rainy street and 6th street. The laundry machine was a nice touch and the beds were really comfortable. If you're a light sleeper, you ought to take the bedroom with the bathroom in it since its window is not on the main street.  I'd definitely recommend this place!"
,,,,,,,,Ryan and Thomas did everything possible to make sure that our stay was as comfortable as possible.  They provided numerous follow ups and were extremely prompt with their communication.  
,,,,,,,,Great space. Clean. Comfortable. Great couches! Easily fit our group of 8
,,,,,,,,"Great time! The rental was exactly how described & was more than accommodating for the 10 of us on this trip. The location was perfect, since it was blocks away from East 6th & minutes away from West. Great food location in proximity, as well. The complex was well maintained & secure. Codes for all gates, so no unwanted guests lurking around. The rental itself had great rooms & the upstairs loft was very spacious. The host made sure we had everything we needed & even had a care package delivered. Above & beyond, in my opinion, these days. I would definitely use this host on any future travel!"
,,,,,,,,"Listing accurate, perfect for our group of 10. Location couldn't be better for experiencing downtown Austin. 6th Street is a five-minute walk away, Rainey Street 10-15 minutes. All the amenities you could need. Not sure we could have done much better for our four-day stay.

5/5, would book again.

"
,,,,,,,,"Great location, easily slept all 6 in our group. Conveniently close to convention center, airport transit, many other hotels and walking distance to everything."
,,,,,,,,"The location of the condo is fantastic! There is easy access to great restaurants, running trails, spas and bars. The complex and condo are on the older side and a little worn but it was clean and comfortable and perfect for my group of 7 women. It could easily sleep more with more doubling up but could get tight fast given the size of common areas and 2 small bathrooms. If you have a lot of bags, be forwarded. No elevator and you have to walk bags up 2 flights of stairs. Not an issue for us, but could be for someone. Property manager easy to communicate with. But more importantly, the info in the condo and sent before hand meant you didn't have to bother him much. Would definitely stay again if part of a larger group."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location right next to the convention center and just a couple blocks off the Dirty Sixth. Lots of restaurant options in the area as well. Great communication by this host and the onsite property manager. 
,,,,,,,,We had 8 people and had plenty of room for everyone. Host was very accommodating and got back to me quickly to answer all my questions. Great experience I would recommend this property to anyone.
,,,,,,,,"This was a great place for my girlfriends and I during our getaway weekend. The place's description and location listings were accurate and comfortable. We had a blast! Thanks, Ryan."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time. Nice location , very central , we had a big group , the apartment was the right size. Clean and well kept. Thomas the local property manager was very helpful and also gave us a few extras parking spots. "
,,,,,,,,"Solid place to stay in Austin. The location couldn't be more central, and put everything we wanted to do within walking distance. The host and his team were very responsive and flexible."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan did an awesome job making us feel right at home. He has several units in this complex, and he runs the operation like a pro. Would certainly stay again. "
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay at The Silver Screen Cinema.  Location is perfect.  Would highly recommend staying hear for a group visiting Austin.  Overall had a great weekend.  Thanks for hosting us Ryan. 
,,,,,,,,"Place was great.  Ryan and his team were remarkably helpful and prompt in answering all questions both before and during the trip.  When the TV/projector stopped working, Ryan had a technician there within 30 minutes to fix it."
,,,,,,,,Host was great.  Pre arrival information was especially helpful
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience in this apartment.  The owner was super responsive for any questions we had.  Also, the apartment was beautiful and perfect for our bachelorette group.  The pool is in the other building, and fairly small, but overall a great rental."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great time with my team in Ryan's place. The apartment comfortably slept 8 people, and fortunately two of our number were addicted to American breakfast - bacon and pancakes every morning. : )

We didn't have any issues and were even able to get a random package delivered. I'd definitely stay in any of Ryan's places again - super convenient to the convention center, great music / good, and awesome coffee (check out Houndstooth - you won't be disappointed!)."
,,,,,,,,"Ryan was a great host! He was super responsive and helpful, not only in hooking us up with two air mattresses (we had nine guys) and an extra parking spot, but also in providing tips on things to do and where to go in Austin. 

The property was just as advertised - very convenient location that is close enough to walk to all the action but far enough not to hear any noise. Plenty of room for nine of us to sleep and everything was clean and functional. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want to hang out in downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,Ryan was a great host.  This was my first experience with AIRBNB and I probably drove Ryan crazy with questions before and after the listing.  His space was in an amazing location in downtown Austin close to restaurants and nightlife.  Ryan was easy to deal with and I would hope any future endeavors with AIRBNB turn out as seamless as this one.  He also went out of his way to help if we needed advice with regard to restaurants.  I highly recommend this property as it is both comfortable and clean.  I'm looking forward to visiting Austin in the future and my first look-up will be Ryan.
,,,,,,,,"Our stay at Ryan's place in Austin was amazing! The location could not be any better for walking around, grabbing food, bar hopping etc, and the house itself was beautiful. Going to hit this place every time I am in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"I cannot say enough good things about Ryan and this property. Great host who was very flexible and accommodating. The unit was in a great location that was right in the middle of everything.
I highly recommend this unit and Ryan for anyone traveling to Austin."
15054511,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Great place! Very comfy bed and awesome views. Easy to access the keys and building. Really enjoyed the location and complex.
,,,,,,,,Gabriela's place was simply amazing. It's in a great location and has truly incredible amenities. The penthouse bar had the most beautiful views of Austin. I would absolutely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Great location)
The bed was amazing! Best B and B mattress ever!
Gabriela was easy to reach and kind enough to get us in on time after a long day of travel."
,,,,,,,,Gabriela did everything she could to make our stay AMAZING! She even got us a bag of goodies and a bottle of wine! Her apartment was extremely nice and walking distance to everything. Would recommend!

14932658,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,Lovely apartment and had everything we needed. Check-in/check-out was super easy.

,,,,,,,,"We stayed at Nicole's place during week one of ACL, and let me tell you, this place was 100% perfect for us! Great location, perfect amenities, and the best location for everything we wanted to do. Roll on SXSW and ACL in 2017"
13451957,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it could not have been any better! Amy was extremely responsive and easy to reach with questions. The apartment is beautiful & very cozy! Great location, would definitely recommend! "
,,,,,,,,This is a great place to stay. Very convenient to downtown. Nice view of the city.
,,,,,,,,"Amy was great to work with. The place was clean, trendy and very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Amy was an amazing host, and her home was absolutely perfect! The location was wonderful, a very short walk to the Frank Erwin Center, so we didn't have to struggle with parking for the concert we attended. Our stay was without issue, Amy responds to any messages quickly and kindly. We would definitely choose her again for our next trip to this great city. â¤"
,,,,,,,,"Very clean, centrally-located condo with modern amenities (high-speed Internet + smart TV), a comfortable bed, full kitchen, and easy access to Austin hotspots. Amy was a thoughtful hostess who clearly communicated access instructions and house rules and provided a map with some of the most popular local attractions. My wife and I greatly enjoyed our visit. I would definitely stay at Amy's place again. "
,,,,,,,,This place is perfect for hanging in Austin. Amy did an awesome job of accommodating our schedule and keeping in touch. She got back to us right away with answers to questions and even have us a discount code for RideAustin. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking to explore the fun city of Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Amy was very proactive, communicative and available to us throughout our stay. The location was super convenient to access all of our top ""things to do"" in Austin (Downtown, the UT campus, hike/bike trail on Lady Bird Lake, South Congress, etc). Nice that there was a parking spot for our rental car as well! "
,,,,,,,,"Everything you need to feel at home. Walking distance to many hot spots in Austin. Amy made checking in very easy. Her communication was excellent. Overall: great host, great place. We had a wonderful time and I highly recommend staying here on your next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Amy was a super host - she was always available and accommodating as well as helpful. The modern, urban space was quiet and cool and a sanctuary to come back to after exploring the ciry in the heat. 
We also liked the neighbourhood of 11th Street with its good eats and views of the Capitol, and the fact that it was close enough to walk to downtown. It was equally easy to request cars and take the bus. 
Thanks for making our Austin visit relaxing and memorable. "
,,,,,,,,"Amy made me feel very welcome, the BnB was very nice and in a great location. Loved that I had a reserved parking spot inside the garage, it felt very safe. She was very easy to communicate with any questions and went out of her way to make sure I had instructions for how to find the unit. I will definitely be trying to get this place again when I am back in town!"
,,,,,,,,"Amy was more than available and helpful at every step of the process, place was clean, located with easy access. Basically a perfect experience."
,,,,,,,,Everything was ready to go. Very comfortable. This condo is right at the downtown area minutes from everything.
,,,,,,,,"Everything about our stay at Amy's place was perfect! The condo was quiet at night and is perfectly located. We loved having access to a washer and dryer during our stay. 

Amy provided more than enough information on things to do in Austin and was extremely helpful while we were planning our trip. Great host!"
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was perfect, spacious and pretty. My favorite part was the linen. The towels and the sheets were high quality, there were plenty of pillows and the mattress was great. The place is impeccable. Amy was very communicative and friendly. She responded right away when I had questions. When I couldn't figure out how to get in, she came over and video herself opening the door (lol). That was super!

In terms of location, the apartment is close to the bars, cafes and restaurants in the east side (which is a super cool area) but you will be relying mostly on ""Fasten"" which is like Uber, a taxi system super easy to use. It is a good 20 min walk to the ""happening"" area but you may not want to walk in the heat. In car, you are in the right spot of town in 10 mins max. The apartment is by a highway, which makes it super convenient is you will be moving around. I was commuting to another part of town so it was convenient. Even though the apartment looks close to downtown, you can't really walk there because you'd have to cross under the highway. In short: it is close to everything you need but you will be taking a car ride. You can download Fasten at the airport and then it is easy and cheap.

Last but not least: great Internet connection! I was able to do video conferences without a problem.

I will definitely stay in Amy's place in my next trip to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Amy was a great host. She was friendly, quick in her communication, and had great instructions. Her place was so comfortable and plenty of space for 3 people. It was a really quick Fare ride to all the hot spots in Austin. The details of her place are spot on. I would love to stay here again if when I come back. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,"Amy's place was amazing.  It was extremely comfortable, well equipped and clean.  Amy provided great instructions prior to the visit and had additional upon my arrival. She even had a coupon for a free ride with a ride share company. She was incredibly responsive to all of my messages including when asked for restaurant recommendations in the area.  Speaking of area, the location is wonderful as it was adjacent to downtown and located in the Eastside which in my opinion is the best of Austin.  I happened to stay during the fourth and was able to watch the fireworks from her balcony.

If you plan to visit Austin you would hard pressed to find a better location or host. I highly recommend this location.  Thanks Amy for welcoming me to Austin!! "
3609272,4.5,9,10,9,10,10,10,Absolutely loved the condo. Perfect location and everything was immaculate and as described. I always look forward to staying with top trip rentals.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was exactly as the pictures, and description. Easy booking, check-in/out and a nice, clean place to stay. "
,,,,,,,,Very friendly host that was easy to get in touch with. 
,,,,,,,,"Great spot! Neat and clean, walkable to great nightlife. "
,,,,,,,,"Top Trip Rentals provided detailed information on our reservation from the time I contacted them to the time we checked out.
The location of this apartment was AMAZING!!! Right on 6th street and has a great night view of the downtown area.

-The place could use a few upgrades (carpet, more TVs, taller shower head) but it was great for our night in Austin, great deal and the Host are very informational! "
,,,,,,,,The host was able to make our stay amazing. The extra air mattresses worked out perfect and was responsive on every question we asked 
,,,,,,,,"This rental was as described, a beautiful loft in a great neighborhood. It's a short walk to the convention center and great nightlife is a block away. This was my first airbnb but the process seemed very easy and secure. Way better option than nearby hotels."
,,,,,,,,"Amazing location if your planning a fun weekend in Austin.  Very professional and great communication (such as letting us know its a noisy area and that the building would be under construction).  
The bathroom is a bit dated and some of the tiles on the kitchen counter were missing, but overall didn't bother me. Great views from our unit!"
,,,,,,,,"loft as described, great location, detailed instructions made the process easy"
864954,4.5,9,10,8,10,9,8,This place was a perfect spot for walking to bars/restaurants/nightlife. Plenty of room for large groups. Great communication. Clean. Simple.
,,,,,,,,Apartment is in a great location. It easily fit a large group and everyone was very comfortable. 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in a great location for walking to bars/nightlife, and has plenty of sleeping space for a big group. The kitchen is on the small side and living area doesn't have enough seating for a large group. There's also a random open shower in the upstairs bedroom. Overall the layout and furnishings are reminiscent of 1993 Miami, but it gets the job done. It seems like the place is set up for parties, but there have apparently been noise complaints in the past and the amp was removed from the sound system. There is a projector tv but we couldn't figure out how to use it. There was quite a bit of noise in a Friday night, including sirens and the emptying of several dumpsters behind the apartment at about 5 or 6 AM. Host was hands off and communicative. The late check in and early checkout were a bit annoying, especially given the high cost of the rental. This is a good place to stay if you are using it as a launching pad for exploring downtown but won't spend much time at the apartment, and you're ok with bring up bright and early on your last day."
,,,,,,,,"We booked a smaller apartment with the owner. The response and communication was fantastic, to the point that when the owner found a maintenance problem with that unit, he contacted us immediately to put us in another unit (this larger one) in the same building. The location is fantastic and having the parking in that area of Austin is a must.  The living room was comfortable and the check-in/check-out information was easy to follow.  This worked out quite well for an extra night during a business trip.  Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Great location!!! Two blocks from the bars and a 25 min walk from the stadium. It was perfect for my friends and I. 
,,,,,,,,Walking to everything is important because UBER does not exist in Austin and this location is made for that. Even close bike share!
,,,,,,,,"let me tell ya, you can't beat the location. One block from all the action on 6th. few blocks from Rainey st. and if you enjoy a nice walk down to South congress it's not that bad. As for the place itself, very clean and spacious. highly recommend for a group of 5 to 7 people"
,,,,,,,,"The place was large and perfect for our needs. The instructions we received for checking in were extensive and comprehensive, and we had no questions. Every one of our needs was anticipated and the stay was excellent."
,,,,,,,,"The place is exactly like the pictures.  There is tons of space for sleeping, which is great since most of the time you are out and about exploring.  Truly exceptional location.  Walkable to Soco, Dirty Sixth, and Rainy Street.
The host was quick to respond and was very kind, but did charge an extra $52 dollars for an Austin Hotel tax.  Something to make sure you see and read about before hand.  There was also no flexibility with check in/out time.  Which was inconvenient since we were walking through the city dragging our luggage for 4 hours.  Not the end of the world, but definitely a few minor inconveniences that made things difficult for a group of 6."
,,,,,,,,Location and the condo itself was very nice! (3rd floor walk up). Lots of sleeping space and enough bathrooms to share. But please be aware of the 15% hotel tax in addition to the cost after paying the Airbnb service fee! We missed this tidbit at the end of the description and caught us by surprise. But overall a really good location! 
,,,,,,,,"Great location.   I'm sure it's listed, but just to reiterate - this is a three story walk up with no elevator.  Just something to keep in mind if you have Lots of luggage!"
,,,,,,,,We stayed for a reunion. Owner communicated well. Location is perfect for access to 6th and a quick cab (or pedicab) trip to Rainey street. Lots of sleeping space and bathrooms were fine. The cable box didn't work and speakers are disconnected so bring a hdmi connector and laptop if you feel like watching anything. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay and would recommend for large groups on a budget. 
,,,,,,,,I had such a great stay at this location! We stayed here for my friends bachelorette party and could easily sleep 10 girls. The location is amazing - right downtown and you can walk to anything you may need! It was great for going out because it was super close to 6th St. AustinStays was very easy to communicate with and answered any/all questions that I had before my stay. I would definitely stay at this location again!
,,,,,,,,"Great location, but the interior isn't much to brag about.  Beds are clean, but cheap and spongy.  Bathroom space and orientation is functional but awkward (particuarly the open shower upstairs).

The apt complex is outdated and worn, but safe.

Landlord communication and instructions are great!

Overall, this is perfectly suited for a group of people who want to crash somewhere for a few nights and don't care about how the interior of the place looks.  The only value here is the location."
,,,,,,,,Perfect location to go see Austin!  The place is pretty nice and can fit 9 people easily.  The Host was also very helpful and provided a lot of communication.
,,,,,,,,Sandeep was very easy to work with. Always very accommodating and quick to answer questions. The location of the rental was ideal!! We could walk everywhere in downtown Austin. It was a great space for fitting a big group of girls. There was somewhere for everyone to sleep without feeling overly crowded. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in the heart of downtown Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location , was able to accommodate a big group. "
,,,,,,,,"I would recommend this place to any large group looking to stay in a very convenient downtown Austin location. I stayed at the apartment with five others while attending a conference at the Convention Center a few blocks away. The location was very convenient for getting to and from the Convention Center but also super close to other downtown things to do like restaurants and bars. The unit comfortable slept six of us- we each had our own bed with 4 of us having our own room. Since the apartment is downtown, it was quite loud at night (which is what you get for the location) so I would suggest bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper.

Communication with Sandeep was great. He provided us with all detailed instructions, etc. in a timely manner. We also had a brief misunderstanding (they thought we had smoked in the unit when we did not) and he handled it quickly and professionally."
,,,,,,,,Very good!
,,,,,,,,"Communication was great, not having keys is super helpful when a few of you stay there and everyone is coming & going at different times because of a conference.  Last but not least, it's an outstanding location.

If you want A/C less than 72, then this is not your place (per the instructions on the wall).  The place is a bit 'beat up'.  The windows are also pretty thin.  There was some construction happening outside throughout the night and it was disruptive.

On my hotel scale of no-tell motel to Westin, this one ranks about a Best Western or Holiday Inn Express :)

All-in-all, a pretty good value."
,,,,,,,,This condo worked out perfect for our group! The host was very responsive and worked with us to make our stay enjoyable. We were concerned about the check in times and check out times however we understood because we only stayed 1 night. Thanks for making this a memorable trip!
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, right in the middle of everything! Great spot for a large group of folks looking to have one place to stay. The lack of AC control is a bit uncomfortable but the fans help to keep the temperature down. They keypad for the door is clutch for a large group as no one needs to carry around keys and people can come in and out as needed. Parking spot inclusion is also a great perk for the area. "
,,,,,,,,"Location is perfect. Could not be in a better place to explore Austin. However I wish the accommodations matched the perfect location. The condo was run down and definitely did not look in real life as good as the pictures. One of the bathrooms did not work property. There is no toilet upstairs in the upstairs bedroom just a shower that sprays into the room because no glass partition. The whole place needs updating for the price that was charged. With a little bit of work the condo could be wonderful, but In current condition I would not stay in it again as it is not much different in pricing than paying for a nice hotel. "
,,,,,,,,"Overall decent place to stay, but felt a little dirty. One of the shower handles was broken, and the room setup was strange. To get to one of the bedrooms, you have to go through the bathroom. The location of this specific building is on the corner and very noisy. 
"
,,,,,,,,Loved the stay.  I honestly felt like the condo was undersold in terms of convenience.  2 blocks from 6th street bars and CVS.  I had a great stay and would recommend this to anyone. 
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location. Condo was exactly as described. Only things that were challenging were locking the front door from the outside and figuring out where the trash should be deposited. "
,,,,,,,,An absolutely perfect location! The host was very responsive and check-in was simple.
,,,,,,,,"functional, great location, host responds quickly/reliable, easy access in and out of building. works for practical purpose but if you are looking for guest-centered experience look around. could ask less of guests (I was even asked to take my trash to the dumpster) I think it is reasonable to keep a place clean and make beds before you leave but taking out the trash sounds like it would be covered under the cleaning cost.  I was asked not to use the dishwasher. overall underwhelmed and I felt like I was working for the host. Check in was at 5pm and if i wanted sooner i would be charged $50 check out was at 10am. "
,,,,,,,,Host was very communicative and responsive. Unit and neighborhood were as described. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, the condo was just as described. I received clear instructions before my arriving. They offered Unser a bigger apartment."
,,,,,,,,Good spot for large groups right in the center of the Austin action. It's got some city miles on it but overall it had enough room for our big group. Host is very easy to work with.
,,,,,,,,"Sandeep was great. He was responsive and accommodating to all our needs. I had originally inquired about a different apartment Sandeep rents and he upgraded us to this lovely place since it was available which was very nice of him. The place was spacious and clean. It's in the perfect location in downtown and the instructions for getting into the complex, parking and apartment was easy. "
,,,,,,,,This condo was located in a great location. We were in walking distance to multiple restaurants and night life. I would highly recommend this condo and would stay here again.  
,,,,,,,,"We rented 2 condos, each in good shape and comfortable settings. Close proximity to lots of attractions. Directions to get in and out of the condos were easy, info provided in a timely manner ahead of arrival. All in all, a good experience. "
,,,,,,,,"Great condo in an amazing area of Downtown Austin. Walking distance to lots of good bars and restaurants. Really a huge place with a good balcony in the back that's great for hanging out on. 

Definitely recommend it as a good spot for people that are looking to visit Austin and have a good time."

,,,,,,,,"Four of us stayed here on a business trip. The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos, so that's always good. It's in a great spot close to convention center, and a short (20 min) walk to South Congress. All in all a good location. Was a bit loud outside on the Saturday night, but hey it's downtown on a Saturday night, so that didn't really bother us! The only thing that stood out as room for improvement was having some little perks available - some fruit in a bowl, or bottles of water, etc. I feel that if you want to compete with other AirBnb listings, it's good practice to do this. It goes a long way. The place was pretty bare bones. There are a few glasses and plates (more now, as we bought some wine glasses we didn't really need!). The sheets and towels were a bit basic and rough, but clean. The lights were not intuitive at all, but we figured them out. Switches don't work, or are in spots where you wouldn't expect them. 10AM check out is a bit weird, and you have to pay more to stay after that. 
Overall, it was a good spot, and clean, but felt slightly less detailed than it could've been. It served our purpose well, but didn't blow our minds. I would recommend it for a group of 4-5 people who just want a decent roof over their head in a good location, and are in to team building or bonding like we were. Otherwise, a hotel is roughly the same price. ~ 3 1/2 Stars."
,,,,,,,,"Had four couples staying for a Thanksgiving getaway and were very happy. Great apartment in a fantastic location. Clean, modern and well appointed."
,,,,,,,,Sandeep made one of his beautiful homes available for me at the very last minute! He was fast on email and the perfect host. 
,,,,,,,,Great! The house was set up and move in ready in the perfect location and proximity to the formula 1 exposition. Everything was clean and well maintained. Sandeep was very responsive to all questions that we had.
,,,,,,,,Sandeep's condo(s) were an amazing location to stay for a bachelor party in Austin.  He was very responsive and helpful throughout the booking process.  Would definitely stay again if I find myself in Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Sandeep's apartment couldn't have been in a better location! Near plenty of bars and amazing restaurants, everything we needed was walkable from the apartment. Everything was clean, check-in was easy and Sandeep was available when we had questions. Will definitely be back!"
,,,,,,,,Terrific property and location!
,,,,,,,,"Came in for a 4 day weekend with old friends, as soon as we walked in everyone was running around like kids at camp picking out bunks.  Place was the perfect size for our group of 7 adults.  We cooked breakfasts out of the amazing kitchen and thanks to the detailed information and suggested spots to see, we had a great visit.  Everything was clean and well kept.  The bathrooms and showers were great after a long day of walking around in Austin.  Couldn't have asked for a better place."
,,,,,,,,"I was in Austin for a girls' weekend and this condo was perfect! Great for large groups - plenty of beds. It is centrally located allowing for an easy walk/bike ride around downtown and the city. It came with a lot of the ""extras"" - full kitchen with all the plates, utensils, etc., plenty of bath towels, etc. The bathrooms were a little tricky - one shower/sink completely open to the bedroom and another with a tricky shower head. But other than that, it was a good pick. Plus, Sandeep was really helpful setting this up and answering any questions we had. "
,,,,,,,,"Five buddies and I headed to Austin for some golfing and boating.  The house is huge and very close to downtown, but a couple blocks away to be shielded from all the noise of 6th St.  If the house was ever lacking in something, it was dropped off later that day.  Great experience!."
,,,,,,,,The reservation was canceled 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"The place is great! We stayed here during SxSWedu and had a great time. The condo is clean, comfortable, and centrally located. "
,,,,,,,,The house was perfect for the 4 of us and could easily accommodate (URL HIDDEN) exceeded my expectations!  
15886011,4.5,10,10,10,10,10,10,"Jason was courteous and professional, and the apartment was clean and very nice overall. The reason this is not a 5 star review is because the apartment comes with a number of relatively strict rules. For example, failure to remove trash will result in a $200 fine, and changing the refrigerator settings will result in a $500 fine. The host asks that you keep the thermostat between 70 degrees and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. We followed the rules as best we could and did not have any issues at checkout, but it seems like a well-meaning traveler could run afoul of some of these requirements and would face an expensive penalty."
,,,,,,,,"Jason's place is as awesome as it looks in the pictures. It's spacious, clean and close to downtown Austin. Coffee shop and Bee mini-mart within walking distance. 

Jason himself was always responsive and helpful when I had questions. 

Overall a wonderful host and a great Austin experience! Thanks Jason!"
,,,,,,,,"Myself and 2 friends stayed at Jasons and it was absolutely  perfect. Close to shops, central tourist areas as well as some really cool little bars and restaurants. The apartment was so comfortable and actually very quiet, great for some downtime on the couch after a long day or big night out. This apartment has everything you will need and communication with Jason was speedy and thorough in all details and instructions. 

It was our first time in Austin and we loved it! It has so much to offer and do and this was to perfect location to do it from. We loved it and will be back. "
,,,,,,,,Awesome stay!
,,,,,,,,"Overall a great place. It's close to the downtown 6th street. And the view is pretty good.
However, the amenity is not quite working as expected, needs improvements. "
,,,,,,,,"Great stay, Jason laid out everything we needed in the house including wifi passwords, instructions to use appliances, and house rules. Everything was super easy."
,,,,,,,,Jason was great throughout the process. Property was in a great location and had everything we needed for our weekend. Thoroughly recommend
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic property, would absolutely recommend. Thank you Jason for hosting us.  "
,,,,,,,,Nice apartment with 3 bedrooms two baths. Really good location 
,,,,,,,,Very cool place that lives up to the billing.  Very much enjoyed it and hope to access again.
,,,,,,,,Great apartament in a centre of the city
,,,,,,,,Awesome Austin Texas Loft.  Place had all the amenities needed for us to enjoy a nice Thanksgiving Dinner.  Location is close to downtown and the view of city lights at night really nice.  Jason was just a text away and was gracious to help us get setup.
,,,,,,,,"While they were couple of minor issues in finding the gate and the lock; our overall experience was great. Jason tried his best to make sure our stay was great. 
I want to thank him for sharing his place. 
The location is great as it's a few minutes from the 6th street area and not too far from downtown area in general. "
,,,,,,,,Thanks Jason for a great one night stay in Austin.  The apartment is spacious and modern.  The floor to ceiling windows with big views are rad.  Comfortable and clean as a whistle.  Serious bang for your buck.  Highly recommended.    
,,,,,,,,"Great place, thanks"
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at Jason's place for one night when I was in Austin for work. The place was clean and well-appointed with clean linens, full kitchen, and great wi-fi. The view from the living room and porch is pretty awesome! The location was perfect for me-- close to the convention center and super walkable to food, culture, and nightlife. Great spot to really get a feel for Austin. 

Jason was a great host-- very responsive during the booking process. I didn't need to reach out to him for anything else during my short stay.

I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Clean, centrally located, gated, great communication with host... Would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"My stay was perfect.  It was easy to check in, the location was walkable to my business meetings during the day, and I was able to walk to some cool bars at night.  I will definitely be staying here again."
,,,,,,,,I had a great stay.  Jason's place was super nice and really close to all the cool spots of downtown Austin. I could easily walk everywhere I wanted to go. Everything was smooth with checking and the house was really clean and spacious. I would highly recommend
16407228,,10,10,10,10,10,10,Perfect location close enough to everything we would want to be close to but just far enough we felt removed and comfortable very clean and Zey was extrem my accommodating! Will recommend for friends
5257917,5,9,10,10,10,10,9,"I loved the location, but the bed wasn't comfortable, and the sleeping arrangements are a little weird.  Definitely a great place for a bunch of college kids going out to party, but priced for adults who would probably prefer more privacy."
,,,,,,,,Great stay! Super convenient to 6th street and everything downtown. Killer view from the balcony too. Everything is clean and well appointed. This definitely beats comparably priced hotels in the area and you get more space! 5/5 would recommend  
,,,,,,,,This is a great loft to stay in for a quick trip to Austin. Right in the heart of the city and within walking distance of great bars and restaurants. Highly recommended if you just want to see what Austin is all about. 
,,,,,,,,Great place for those looking for walking distance to 6th Street. Easy to locate and work with. Would highly recommend for mid-20s to 30s group trying to experience a great time in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Great 
,,,,,,,,We had a very good experience! The place was great and very clean and nicely decorated in a great location! The customer service was great we could always get ahold of Top trip if need be! The parking situation was awesome too I recommend trying to get a pass. The only recommendation I have is to download a white noise app if you're sensitive to the 6th street noises! They have vacuum sealed doors that help eliminate sound but if you're worried at all it's a quick fix! 
,,,,,,,,Good location and space accommodated our group of 5 guys.
,,,,,,,,There was great communication with the host. Our group felt right at home and would definately stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was fantastic. We loved being right on 6th street. The loft was clean and perfect for our purposes. Our hosts left us snack when we arrived, which was greatly appreciated! Would stay again."
,,,,,,,,"It was a nice little loft. The pictures make it look brand new an exciting, as does the outside of the building and hallways, but inside the units were pretty basic. Wifi was confusing and didn't work well."
,,,,,,,,"Had a great experience! The place was very clean, trendy, and comfortable. I was
Impressed by the glass doors facing 6th street - very thick and sealed tightly. Adorable place - would stay there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location, very clean, well appointed, and extremely responsive host. Also, don't miss the awesome view of lively 6th Street from the balcony!"
,,,,,,,,"Great stay. Had no issues with the loft and/or host, great view and fantastic location!"
,,,,,,,,The place was exactly as advertised. Right in the heart of downtown. A little noisy but that's to be expected when staying on 6th Street. Was here for work and would stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"This place is in the perfect location, the heart of 6th street! I will forever be staying here. "
,,,,,,,,Great location - close to all the bars and the conference center. The place is clean and well equipped. Highly recommended! 
,,,,,,,,"This is a 5 star location on 6th and five star service from the listing team. They will fix any problem you have with the place and warn you that you are staying in a part of town that stays active 'til two AM. (ie they sent their service guy while we were out to fix a pipe, awesome guy too). The apartment itself is not super luxurious. I understand some of the other reviews that were having trouble with the single bathroom and lack of upscale features. However that's not the function of this place. Everything works fine. It was great for a fun reunion with college friends for me. Sleeps 5 very comfortably, six if two are OK with the pullout sofa bed. Beds are very comfy and keyless access is nice. Provided coffee and a few snacks as well."
,,,,,,,,The company who handles this rental is amazing! They provided all the information we needed and then some. The rental was clean and super conveniently located. I loved the convenience of the parking and key code! Fabulous. I totally recommend it. 
,,,,,,,,"The loft on 6th was awesome!  Plenty of sleeping room, very clean and very centrally located.  Host was great about communicating with me and the apartment was so easy to get in and out of!  We had a great time, would book again."
,,,,,,,,Great location right on 6th street. 
,,,,,,,,The loft was very comfortable and spacious. Chereen was incredibly responsive and provided all the information I needed to access the unit and enjoy Austin. The keyless entries made my arrival easy and I was able to go straight there from the airport without any inconvenience. The loft is very centrally located next to tons of restaurants and bars. It was also very conveniently located near the Westin Downtown where I was attending meetings.
,,,,,,,,"Great place, great location. Very easy to get in the building and in the apartment which makes coming in and out nice. Was in town for work and was able to walk everywhere. I plan on staying here whenever I come in town for work as the rates and location are far better then the Hilton hotel I normally stay at."
,,,,,,,,Great flat in a super location.  Chereen was an excellent host and was on hand to help with anything we wanted.  Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"We got a good deal on this apartment and it was a perfect spot to stay while exploring Austin. Clean, spacious, and incredibly central in its location (we were able to walk all around the city from here). Street noise was a bit loud at night, but didn't prevent us from getting good sleep. Simple, no frills, and a breeze to book, arrive, and check out. "
,,,,,,,,"We had five girls stay at this location and we all couldn't stop raving about how it was the perfect loft for our getaway weekend. Being right on 6th street was awesome and convenient, and we were minutes away from food, music and fun.  The place was in great condition and we loved every minute of our stay in Austin - can't wait to come back (and stay here!)."
,,,,,,,,"Everything one could wish for. Great place the location is right on 6th and close to many restaurants. The apt was clean, the instructions where clear and easy to follow. I would book this anytime "
,,,,,,,,"Went very smoothly...they have many properties and they communicated very well when they had to change my reservation to one down the hall. 

The place was lovely to stay in and I LOVED the keyless entry to allow me to show up on my timeline.

There are some minor maintenance issues with the frig noise and shower head pressure.

I would use them on my next trip."
,,,,,,,,The host made the entire experience easy and gave us all the appropriate information on a timely manner. The location was the best part about this loft! We spent most of our time on the balcony enjoying the view and there were plenty of restaurants nearby so find some grub was never a problem. Lots of closet space and a big bathroom was a big plus for a group of girls! There were some uninvited guests that camped out by the street entrance of the loft that made a group of girls uneasy but there was a door guy that was there to clear the entrance. All and all we had one of the best experiences and staying at this loft made it that much better!! 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect place for me and my friends whilst in Austin. Location right on top of 6th st, and the apartment was modern and comfortable. Could easily accommodate 7 in an open layout. "
,,,,,,,,"I actually stayed in a similar apartment on the 5th floor of the same building, and it was great. Plenty of space, nice breakfast nook, and a fully equipped kitchen to make my own breakfast! The place was clean when we arrived and getting in was wonderfully easy with custom key-codes. The location is amazing, and on the 5th floor you don't really get as much noise from the street down below. I'd likely stay here again if I travel back to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The host switched me to unit 302 before I arrived. It was as promised, though the shower gave new meaning to low-flow. "
,,,,,,,,The place was really cool and in a perfect location.   Check in and out was super easy and I really enjoyed my time there.   Hope to stay there again on my next trip.   Perfect place for SXSW.
,,,,,,,,"Great location, easy entry and access."
,,,,,,,,I loved the loft the view was beautiful the place was convient. I almost didn't want to leave!
,,,,,,,,"Great location for Austin's nightlife and close to a lot of offices during the day, so this worked out perfectly for my needs.  The loft was clean and well taken care of.  Had a small problem with the outside door to the building, but that was resolved very quickly and was very satisfied with the support.  Would definitely stay again when I'm in town next."
,,,,,,,,"Great communication and thorough instructions made my stay a breeze. Do stay here if you want to be in a cool loft walking distance to all downtown has to offer. Don't stay here if the noise of 6th Street will disturb your sleep. It's not too loud, but you can definitely hear it. Will definitely book here next time, A+ experience!"
,,,,,,,,"The top trip crew was in the lobby when we arrived and very welcoming. Prior to arrival, they were great with emails and phone calls, checking to see if I had everything set up, and with giving updates about the building space. They were thorough and up front about things like noise, construction, and access to the building. I would definitely stay here again with a group of friends. The balcony was a huge bonus. They were also accommodating with a late checkout. No frills, had everything I needed!"
9507616,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Perfect location! Perfect hosts! Perfect wknd getaway! 
,,,,,,,,"Nice place, great people!"
,,,,,,,,I would highly recommend this to anyone! Olivia & Josh were so helpful before and during my stay. The room was very cozy and clean. Would stay again if I'm ever back in the area! 
,,,,,,,,"Josh's home is very nice , clean , spacious and comfortable to stay. "
,,,,,,,,Host was friendly.
,,,,,,,,"Nice cozy space, excellent area for walking distance to downtown. The hosts Josh and his girlfriend were super nice and helpful on anything I needed and had some most excellent recommendations for food and bar spots."
,,,,,,,,"Josh went  above and beyond to make my stay the absolute best it could be. It was raining and he gave me an umbrella; he came home from New York and offered me New York bagels and rainbow cookies, plus  he greeted me with the offer of a glass of water or cold beer!!

Walking distance to downtown and a great host. "
,,,,,,,,"A simple and lovely experience. Easily communicated via text, sweet and simple interactions in person. I could come and go easily. "
,,,,,,,,"Great 1 night stay. The location is super walkable to all of the places you'd want to see in SoCo and just a few bucks cab ride away from downtown/Rainey St/6th street. Olivia and Josh were super friendly and helpful before and during our short stay, and let us borrow some last minute items we had forgotten. Very clean, tidy, and cute home. Bedroom and bathroom were comfy and clean! Would definitely recommend to anyone in austin for whatever reason. "
,,,,,,,,Josh was a great host.  He is very friendly and helpful.  The accommodations were as described.  We loved the neighborhood.  Just walk up the street to bustling South Congress shops and restaurants.  
,,,,,,,,"Josh was very friendly and responsive. We booked at the last minute and he hustled home from work to meet us. 
The room was very comfortable and the location convenient."
,,,,,,,,It was amazing
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was great!  Josh and Olivia were friendly and easy to communicate with.  We didn't spend much time at the apartment, but it's really convenient to the South Congress area.  Safe, clean, quiet.  "
,,,,,,,,I loved staying here - the location was perfect for me to get to ACL and explore Austin and I really enjoyed getting to know my hosts - two awesome people that I'm glad I got to meet!
,,,,,,,,Was very quick to respond and very nice. I would definitely recommend it. Over all I had a great experience 
,,,,,,,,"Josh is a wonderful host! We ended up having to change our travel plans and arrive a day late. He worked with me on the dates and things worked out perfectly! His Apt. is nice and clean, close to everything. Within walking distance to watch the bats or go kayaking on the river, as well as some great eateries! 

We highly recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"We didn't have much interaction with Josh as we only were in town for a very short time, but the room was perfect and he was very friendly. The place is in a really great location too. We would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,We had an excellent stay with Josh and Olivia. Both are great hosts with good recommendations about where to get good food and drinks and other activities. The location is also really awesome.
,,,,,,,,Best host ever!! These folks are the real deal. Comfortable room and beautiful apartment accessible to food trucks and public transportation. 
,,,,,,,,"The hosts couldn't have been nicer! Great location, great hosts, great pool, grest experience!"
,,,,,,,,"We received an excellent service!
Josh and his girlfriend are super nice and friendly. They helped us to discover the best spots around the city and made us feel welcome at their home. 
The apartment was super clean and the furnishing and the bed were excellent too. 
The location is perfect, downtown is definitely in walking distance. 
We enjoyed being hosted by them!"
,,,,,,,,"Josh was very accommodating (including getting a twin air mattress for our son);  the place is clean, is in an ideal location, has a very nice pool (very clean).  We were only in and out, but it was perfect."
,,,,,,,,I had a very relaxing experience with Josh & Olivia.
,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful stay at here! The room was extremely comfortable, with a private full bathroom and closet space. It was great for us and our cat, Zeus. Notably, the bed was super comfortable and Josh and Olivia made coffee for us in the morning which was so kind and unexpected. The location was perfect for us! We were able to walk into the city and enjoyed exploring South Congress. Overall, we would highly recommend staying here! Communication was great, Josh and Olivia were lovely to chat with and the room was perfect. We would definitely stay here again and recommend this spot to anyone looking to visit Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Josh and Olivia were very welcoming! We booked quite last minute and they happily accommodated us. The room was clean, comfortable, and as expected. Olivia often works from home so she was able to give us a lot of recommendations during our stay. The location of the apartment can't be beat - right on South Congress (where there are a lot of food and shops) and only a 20 minute walk to downtown and Rainey street where all the cool bars are! Austin is a pretty small town and this apartment is in the center of all the action. "
,,,,,,,,Only stayed one night and we weren't really at the spot except to sleep. Catered perfectly to our needs!
,,,,,,,,"Josh is a hard working guy, and he was very welcoming to me on my short trip to Austin. He had good time to recommend places to me; and I followed his recommendations ! The bedroom was perfect with a toilet and shower, so basically, it's all you could need in good comfort on your trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Josh was easy-going, generous, and welcoming. No problems at all. Apartment is clean and nice, and right on South Congress, as advertised. Easy and great stay."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was very nice, and very close to the Bat Bridge on South Congress. It was easy to walk to all of the hot spots in SoCo. Josh was out of town while we were there, so we had the whole place to ourselves, but Josh was communicative and helpful via text while we were there.  Our only complaint was that the bathroom was pretty gross. The tub and bathroom sink were dirty (especially the tub), and there was a lot of hair on the shower walls and on the tub. But the worst part was that the tub does not drain as fast as the shower, so you had to stand in a dirty tub filled with water while you showered. Ewww.  I let Josh know, but there was no apology nor explanation. The dirty bathroom made the stay disappointing."
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay at Josh and Olivia's place - I unfortunately did not get to meet them as they were out of town, but they were very communicative although my reservation was very last minute. They explained the check-in process in detail and it was easy to find and access. The apartment is in a fantastic location, right on Soco and its shops/bars, and a 5 min drive / 20 min walk from Downtown which is super convenient for visitors. It is of a generous size, with an equipped kitchen and dining room perfect for those who also like to cook at home. The bedroom is comfortable and it's great having your own bathroom too with available linen and toiletries. The only downside of the bedroom is that it is located close to the corridor and you can occasionally hear neighbors chatting and walking by, but this didn't bother me much as I wasn't in Austin to sleep all day!"
,,,,,,,,Overall a great experience with Josh. Couldn't ask for a more accommodating host for my first experience with Airbnb. Would definitely recommend to others looking to come to Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Josh and Olivia could not have been more welcoming and helpful!  This place is all about location. You are right on South Congress, walking distance to downtown, the bat spectacle on the bridge, Congress and all the fun boutiques and restaurants. The bed was comfortable and it was very nice to have the well stocked private bathroom....Olivia provided some of the most amazing smelling soap! They were also very open about sharing their common spaces and offering us snacks, but we were really out exploring most of the days. Only reason it was not a perfect 5* were that the room was a bit darker than expected as it faced a corridor and had blinds and black out shades....and the walls were very thin, so it was not the quietest, most private feeling... Not a big deal if you are in Austin to be out and about! And overall a very pleasant stay with a lovely couple!"
,,,,,,,,Quiet apartment in the district prominent of SoCo (many restaurants and food trucks). We were welcomed with great attention by Olivia and Josh.
,,,,,,,,Awesome host! The location was right in the heart of Austin (South Congress). I will definitely recommend Josh for my friends. 
,,,,,,,,Great apartment located in a very convenient part of Austin. Josh and Olivia made us feel part of the family. Definitely going to save this place to my favorites in case I need a place in Austin again.
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay here! I attended a convention at the Hyatt, and this was within easy walking distance. It's also close to the Congress Bridge, so we went there one evening to see the bats fly. The place has free garage parking (have to get a pass from the hosts), which was convenient because we had a rental car. However, we rode the city bus instead of driving in Austin, and several bus stops are located near the apartment. The hosts gladly shared their kitchen as well as banana nut muffins and macaroni and cheese! Good wi-fi connection. Close to the Colorado River for walking and jogging. Overall, quiet, convenient, and nice!"
,,,,,,,,"The location is great it is right on Congress and a short walk away from restaurants, music venues, shops and some fun elements of Austin.
The bed is comfortable, and the private bathroom is nice. Josh was out of town, but was able to connect me with Olivia prior to my visit. Olivia was a great host. 
Olivia was welcoming and friendly, and I felt at home right away. I was in and out for most of the weekend, but she was great about giving me space. She was also very helpful in recommending local places to eat and things to do. I appreciated the time I spent at her place, and would definitely stay again. "
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Josh, Olivia, and other roommates are great! They were very flexible and accommodating. My room had an adjacent bathroom for my exclusive use, which made so many things easy for me. I am glad to have stayed at this apartment!"
,,,,,,,,Great location for touring Austin! Josh and Olivia were wonderful hosts and the apartment has everything I needed. I felt very safe walking around the area as a solo traveler. 
,,,,,,,,Very communicative and a great room right  by all the South Congress awesomeness 
,,,,,,,,"Our hosts were so sweet! Nice apartment right on south congress- perfect for walking to cafes and shops, and a short cab ride from downtown. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was perfect and just what I needed. After a week in Austin my flight was cancelled and I needed a last minute place to stay. The apartment is in a great neighborhood and they even provided nice little soaps and lotion as well in the bathroom.
,,,,,,,,Great location for anyone visiting Austin. Close to everything on South Congress. Josh and Olivia were very flexible and accommodating with my schedule. Easy to come and go throughout the weekend.
,,,,,,,,"Josh and Olivia were wonderful! So sweet and accommodating - we ate dinner together, they made coffee for me in the morning, and they were very attentive to any and all requests to ensure my stay was comfortable. The room is great and the en suite bathroom was very convenient. Great location as you can walk up and down South Congress to amazing food trucks, coffee, live music, etc. I'll definitely be staying again!"
,,,,,,,,"Josh's apartment was really nice and clean and right on South Congress so very convenient for shopping, going out, eating, etc. He was really helpful and promptly answered all of our questions despite being out of town. "
,,,,,,,,"Josh and Olivia  was a great host and I really felt comfortable in his nice apartment. Its location is quite nice and central. I enjoyed our stay very much. Olivia and Josh help me with everything there, they are very friendly."

7542470,5,10,10,10,10,10,10,Very clean. Comfortable bed. Very welcoming and friendly. 
,,,,,,,,"Great Air BnB. 
Hosts: AJ&Meaghan were awesome. Friendly, chill and very accommodating. 

*Appreciated the tech with the door/key app for easy in/out 

*fast WIFI

Location: accessible to both food spots on the east side and airport. Used Fare for ride share.

Room: modern, open and sunny. Whiteboard was a definite plus for some creative thinking . Bed was comfy and fine for 2x as the memory foam really reduced feeling movement from your bed mate. Bathroom was well dressed with lots of supplies, extra towels etc 

This is a great ""home-base"" spot as you explore Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a fabulous one night stay at Meaghan and AJ's place. When we first arrived, AJ let us in and showed us to our room. They have gorgeous hardwood floors and their home was spotless. After meeting AJ, we met Meaghan who was also super sweet. They gave us excellent restaurant and late night bite recommendations... (one of which we went to for delicious small plates and killer cocktails). The bed was very comfortable and it was nice to have our own bathroom right next door to our bedroom. All and all it was a great place to stay and AJ and Meaghan couldn't have been nicer! We hope to stay there again but a little longer next time! "
,,,,,,,,"The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Meaghan let us drop off our bags before check in time so we were able to explore down town in the mean time! The place is very close to down town Austin. I would definitely stay here again. Meaghan and AJ are welcoming too and recommended places to visit. "
,,,,,,,,AJ & Meaghan were a delight to work with. Their house is beautiful and if you're going to be spending your time in downtown Austin you cannot beat the location for the price. We would 10/10 stay here again and could not be happier! 
,,,,,,,,Clean and central location! AJ and Meaghan were very helpful and friendly. We had a great stay!
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin, central to everywhere I needed to go. AJ and Meaghan were extremely welcoming and helpful during my stay too. Highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"We only stayed at AJ and Meaghan's for one night, and had the chance to meet AJ! They were very accommodating and let us drop our luggage off prior to check-in for convenience! The room and shared bath were both clean, making the stay very comfortable. The home is modern and simple and very beautiful. I definitely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,"AJ & Meaghan's place is beautiful. The room was clean, modern, and just what we needed for our quick trip to Austin. AJ & Meaghan were welcoming and gave us great recommendations for the city. We didn't have a car and their place is in a great location if you want to walk to some of the main Austin attractions."
,,,,,,,,"The house and room were exactly as explained. Very clean and neat! I met the host once as I visited for the conference. But she was really kind and tried to help me a lot. It might be good if I will be able to have a personal key for my room as well. However, since I can lock my door when I am in my room, privacy is still protected.  In a walking distance, everything is nearby like bbq restaurants and cvs. Highly recommend to stay if I visit Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"AJ & Meaghan provide a great space for airbnb guests.  Their attention to details in every aspect of the guest space was evident; from the notes and instructions to magazines and local information, and from the amenities provided to the ease in gaining access to their home with their detailed instructions.  The room, bathroom, and common areas of the home were immaculately clean!  We also enjoyed the recommendations they provided us for places to eat.  We took their advice and would equally recommend each place we visited.  The home is also in a great location with only a short walk to enjoy Austin's nightlife, and the trendy restaurants of the east side.  Our quick chats with AJ & Meaghan also made us feel very welcomed.  When we return to Austin, we will definitely see if we can stay with them again, and we highly recommend their listings to other travelers/guests."
,,,,,,,,Beautiful place! Great location too
,,,,,,,,Clean room as advertised. Cleaner was rude and judgmental. 
,,,,,,,,"For our first time in Texas I'm glad we had this airbnb first!  The pictures and the posting are very accurate with their description. It was a nice, clean big house that is super close to downtown Austin. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a pleasant time at AJ & Meaghan's beautiful, spacious home. The room was a good size with a furnished patio. Location was close enough downtown to walk to local places and spaces with ease. AJ & Meaghan were really communicative and clearly explain everything before arrival. Throughout the house are helpful labels, too."
,,,,,,,,"The listing was exactly as expected - clean, comfortable, and a convenient location for the price. AJ and Meaghan were very accommodating and quickly responded to our messages. If I come back to Austin, I know where I'll be staying!"
,,,,,,,,House was nice 
,,,,,,,,The Yeager Tower was great! Very convenient to access and the decor was awesome. The location is a short drive to 6th street and having be only 1 block from Franklin BBQ is wonderful! :D 
,,,,,,,,Or stay in Austin was a very enjoyable one. AJ and Meagan have a beautiful home in an ideal location for touring Austin. Everything from booking to check in to recommendations was handled in an efficient and timely manner. They went out of their way to make the stay as good as possible. I'd stay here again without hesitation.
,,,,,,,,A great place to stay and the hosts were very accommodating!
,,,,,,,,"Nice, clean, and modern place. Very close to great food (Paperboy for breakfast, Blue Dahlia Bistro for any meal).
"
,,,,,,,,"Meaghan and AJ's home was beautiful, clean and in a great location. We were able to drop our bags off early and explore the city before our room was ready. Our hosts were very responsive and the listing was exactly as described. We would definitely recommend this space for other visitors! We also loved all of the Austin tips they shared with us. Thanks for an awesome stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay! Comfortable, clean room in a modern home. Sharing the bathroom with one other guests was absolutely no problem. We especially loved the location - very walkable with cute restaurants (thanks for the great recommendations, AJ & Meaghan), cafÃ©s and shops close by. Depending on how much you enjoy walking (we sure do!) places like E 6th St, Texas State Capitol and Downtown Austin in general are close by (at least in our opinion). Even walking at night was no problem. Oh yeah, and there are also a few bus stations around which makes getting around even easier (and cheap - day pass for 2.50).
There was some confusion in the bathroom regarding what can be used by the Airbnb guests and what was meant for private use only. Most of the time there were helpful little notes though. 
All in all, we had a lovely time! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying with AJ and Megan has been the best Airbnb experience I've ever had, they are the most welcoming, intelligent and inspiring people I've met in a long time. They have the most beautiful and spotless place in Austin and you will not experience anything less than a five star hotel service from them!"
,,,,,,,,Great stay and extremely hospitable
,,,,,,,,"Awesome place, will consider come next time!"
,,,,,,,,"Staying with AJ and Meaghan was awesome. They have a beautiful apartment, in a perfect location. The bus stop is right across the street, and there are loads of nice places to eat in walking distance."
,,,,,,,,"This is by far one of the most stunning air b'n'b places I have ever stayed in. Beautifully decorated, clean, friendly and a perfect location. It was the perfect base for my stay in Austin and ideal for those that want to stay within the downtown city limits, yet close enough to walk to everything thats needed. 

I would highly recommend staying here."
,,,,,,,,Their house is awesome. The location was great. They were super helpful. What more could you ask for?
,,,,,,,,Aj and Megan were very welcoming and made arriving a great experience. Gorgeous house and looked exactly like the pictures. Very clean. Would stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"This was my second stay at ""Yager Tower"" and as always it was a great stay. AJ + Meaghan are great hosts. Their place is awesome to explore Austin from. I'd say avoid the line at Franklin's and go down 12th to Sam's BBQ for a real eastside experience and flavor. Memory foam matress/pillows and keyless entry make this place top notch. Two-thumbs up!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my second stay ""Yager Tower"" and as usual it was great. AJ and Meaghan are great hosts and their place is very nice. An awesome place to explore Austin from. Memory foam mattress/pillows, and keyless entry make the spot top notch. Two thumbs up!"
,,,,,,,,My boyfriend and I were in town visiting family and this bnb was absolutely stunning. It was close to everything we needed and our host was the sweetest. The place was super clean and super cute! We felt so comfortable and will definitely be returning for future stays.
,,,,,,,,"Great communication and recommendations before the trip. The amenities were amazing and beautiful with a dream kitchen. Loved the night mask and earplug touches. There are 2 rooms in a corner of the house that could potentially be rented out, so could be 4 people and 1 bathroom situation.
About 1mile from downtown which is walkable, although wouldn't recommend it in the summertime. "
,,,,,,,,"My friend and I were traveling cross country and knew we wanted to airbnb across the country and Austin was awesome. First of all this house is immaculate, brand new minimalistic house. Our bathroom was directly across from our bedroom. Serena, AJ's sister, took AMAZING care of us! She had great suggestions on where to go and this location is a close ride to 6th street. Serena we had a blast! thanks you so much!! Thanks for being a private Uber !!!! Take Care, See you next time I'm in Austin!"
,,,,,,,,AJ & Meaghan were great hosts. The bed was super comfy! Convenient location. Great stay!
,,,,,,,,"It's was really amazing. I spent a week in their  beautiful home. AJ&Meghan are nice couple. It's my first Airbnb experience where someone change sheets and arrange the room. In a nutshell,i loved it."
,,,,,,,,"AJ and Meaghan were super awesome and accommodating. Their house is super dope and looks exactly like the pictures, maybe better."
,,,,,,,,The room was clean and comfortable. The location was perfect. Parking was easy.
,,,,,,,,AJ and Meaghan we're welcoming and gracious hosts. Their house is beautiful with beautiful natural light and open space. I had a great stay.
,,,,,,,,I had a great time staying at AJ and Meaghan's place. It is very clean and the room / bed was comfortable. The location is about a 20 minute walk to 6th Street / downtown.
,,,,,,,,"AJ and Meaghan were amazing - open, friendly, and helpful. They made us feel very welcome, and we loved staying in their beautiful home. The room was clean, bright, and very comfortable and we knew where to find everything we needed while we were there. That our stay was so easy and pleasant made it clear to us that they had thought through all the details. We'd love to stay again and highly recommend it to others!"
,,,,,,,,"AJ and Meaghan is very comfortable, clean and well equipped  They were very kind and provided us with everything we needed. Location is very convenient (close to downtown). We had an amazing weekend in Austin and if we go back there will def be at AJ and Meaghan's house. Thank you guys! "
,,,,,,,,"Very clean and comfortable appartment. Everything you need, is availble and AJ&Meaghan are both great Hosts.  Perfect (SXSW) location!
"
,,,,,,,,"AJ & Meaghan were wonderful hosts! Very welcoming, very helpful and nice to talk to! The house is beautiful and very well kept. Walking distance to downtown. Parking was a breeze. I would absolutely recommend staying with them. I wish we could have stayed for longer.   "
,,,,,,,,"The house was absolutely lovely and the hosts very welcoming. We didn't really run into them very much since we were busy most of the day, but the few minutes we did interact they were extremely nice. Their house was very clean and the instructions on how to get in the house and what the house rules were where very clear. They had towels that smelled really nice! We had a great time in Austin due to the great home we were able to stay in."
,,,,,,,,"Great hosts. Super nice. Clean house. Great location. They'll point you in the right direction as well. 

Perfect stay. Thanks for everything."
,,,,,,,,A great house in a very good location for anyone looking to stick around the University of Texas or downtown Austin (or just visiting to do Austin things). I highly recommend it. 
,,,,,,,,"Hosts cannot make you feel any more welcome than how AJ & Meaghan made us feel! Even before we arrived, they offered to provide us with places to check out in Austin, and the best part about it was that the major attractions were within 15 min. Their home has a cool setup that they maintain very well organized and clean (spotless). 

Their recommendations and the comfort they accommodated us to truly made our first experience in Austin one that we will surely repeat!"
,,,,,,,,Conveniently located and easy to enter/exit for the business traveler. Lovely room and bathroom. 
,,,,,,,,"Can't think of anything negative about this experience, the neighbourhood, the house, the area, proximity to points of interest, were all very nice. I asked the hosts for suggestions on places to go and they were very helpful. Definitely recommend this listing!"
,,,,,,,,"AJ & Meaghan's place was awesome. It's clean, modern, new, close to downtown and most points of interest. The location was great to explore Austin via driving, walking, and Uber. Hosts had good breakfast recommendations. There are quite few options within a short walk. Definitely the place to stay if it's available."
,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent place to stay.  Although I had been to Austin before, I wasnâ€™t familiar with East Austin where AJ & Meaghanâ€™s apartment was located.  But I couldnâ€™t be happier with how my stay turned out.  While my trip was centered around relaxing the last week of the year, you could easily choose their home for a business trip.  The aesthetic and ambience is similar to a boutique hotel with helpful hosts that are cool and easygoing.  In addition, the place is immaculately clean.  I would highly recommend staying with them.  

In terms of proximity to food, itâ€™s walking distance to several great eats including Hillside Farmacy, Paperboy, Blue Dahlia Bistro and Quickie Pickie.  For drinks, itâ€™s a quick Lyft or Uber to Rainey Street or the many hip lounges on E 6th St including Whislerâ€™s, East Side Showroom, and Violet Crown Social Club.  Itâ€™s also a quick ride to South Austin and Zilker Park.  You really canâ€™t go wrong with the location of their apartment.  And both Meaghan and AJ are terrific hosts!"
,,,,,,,,Great home! The location was convenient and was impressed by everything in the house! AJ and Meaghan made my stay relaxing and hassle-free!

,,,,,,,,A really enjoyable stay in Austin - the location was convenient to downtown and only a few uber dollars to South Congress or Rainey Street. AJ and Meaghan were welcoming with useful tips for around town yet not overbearing in a very relaxed Airbnb environment. Great price point for a clean and comfortable stay with professionals so close to central Austin.
,,,,,,,,"A brilliant place to stay due to the location and excellent hosts. 
Communication from the start was great but even better upon arrival. With AJ and Meaghan providing a great list of areas to explore and things to do. 
The house is a beautiful place within walking distance to all the fun things to see and do, but importantly the house has all the features you want. No restrictions placed upon you on arrival by AJ and Meaghan just warm and friendly. 
Highly recommend staying here if you're in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Good location. Condo was clean. AJ and Meaghan made us feel welcome. Would recommend to others
,,,,,,,,AJ was great.  Clean rooms and bathrooms.  Thanks for the stay.
,,,,,,,,"Mein Zeit bei AJ & Meaghan war wirklich sehr schÃ¶n. Alles hat super geklappt. Die Kommunikation war einwandfrei und ihr Haus und das Zimmer war genauso, wie ich es mir vorgestellt hatte. Die beiden waren auch extrem hilfsbereit und gastfreundlich.  "
,,,,,,,,"AJ and Meaghan are very kind and delightful people. They made us feeling at home from the first second and it has been a pleasure staying with them. They are very open and helped us in everything we needed. Moreover, they have great recommendations on restaurants and places to go :)

The room is nice and clean as the house is as well. The locations is very convenient, you can reach basically any place in Downtown with a short ride or a 15-20 minutes walk if you are up to it. The neighborhood is quite and safe.

Definitely a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,AJ and Meaghan have a fantastic house! The quality of stay couldn't have been better. I would absolutely stay there again if I returned to Austin. Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,"We were in Austin to attend ACL and this place was in a great location as we could walk downtown to the shuttle.   There are many restaurants and bars nearby.   It's also a quick walk to the Capitol and Texas State Cemetery.   The house is very clean.   While it was very clear that another bedroom could be rented in the house (and Meaghan told it was before our visit), it was not clear to either couple that we would be sharing a bathroom.   It worked out okay but it was ""bathroom roulette"" in the morning and evening as we were all getting ready and coming home from the same event at the same time.   There were no mirrors in the bedroom we had so no opportunity to do some bathroom related things in the bedroom.  There was no storage in our room for our clothes.   We had to push some personal items to the side in the closet to make room for our suitcases which we used as dressers.   They are a very nice couple but they are very much working from home (as stated in the description) - on the phone both upstairs and downstairs so guests need to be quiet.  As there were other guests floating in and out of the house, it felt a bit like a hostel.   For some folks, this would probably be perfectly comfortable but it wasn't a great fit for us.  "
,,,,,,,,AJ and Meaghan weren't home during the weekend we were in Austin but they did a great job of making us feel welcome even so. The room was clean and the house was well-designed and modern. We loved the neighborhood- in up and coming East Austin. Thanks so much for a great home-base to explore a new city from.
,,,,,,,,"AJ is a great host, very friendly and helpful.
The house is awesome; the room was super clean.
I would highly recommend this place."
,,,,,,,,"I had a great experience at AJ & Meaghan's home. I was only there for one night and got in late so I didn't get the chance to meet them, but their home and my room was beautiful, clean, and very conveniently located for downtown. I absolutely recommend them!"
,,,,,,,,"Very very very welcoming couple. The home is modern and extremely inviting. I slept in the room with a whiteboard in it, which helped with my studies for the MCAT. AJ & Meaghan were extremely accommodating with all my needs. Definitely recommend their home for a comfortable short stay. "
,,,,,,,,Review is in earlier message.
,,,,,,,,It was a short (one night) but a five star experience!! AJ and Meaghan were really welcoming and gave us good advices!  The house was beautiful and the bed really comfy! I definitly recomend this place! 
2011847,4.5,9,9,9,9,10,9,Beautiful and well maintained home. We felt very taken care of and there was always a quick response if we needed anything. The location was beyond perfect as we were able to walk back and forth from Downtown and take a quick ride to other prime locations every day. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,"This was a nice, minimal place to stay. The room is a little tight if you have some luggage, but it definitely works. Very close (walking distance) to downtown and great restaurants and bars. The neighborhood looks a bit sketchy, but it's fine. Overall a good experience."
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay, I would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Austin"
,,,,,,,,"It was a great place to stay for a quick, last minute stay in Austin. The owners are nice and very responsive. The neighborhood was nice. Affordable. Clean. Has every amenity you would need. Be aware that the room is a little small so if you are someone who needs space, this might not be the spot for you."
,,,,,,,, Nice home. Clean room. A little unsettling neighborhood location
,,,,,,,,Clean place.
,,,,,,,,Nice clean apartment next to downtown Austin. Neat check in with electronic locks and a comfortable bed. Very fast to respond to any queries. The only negatives being the size of the room and the size of the shower place. Would recommend for a short trip.
,,,,,,,,"I would definitely recommend staying here! It's cute, clean and close to everything in downtown Austin. Most importantly, when I needed anything Chris and Loni were easily accessible and immediately addressed my concerns.  Cheers!"
,,,,,,,,"Easy to find, no issues with parking, bed in room #1 is really comfy. Loved the keyless entry. "
,,,,,,,,"This place was perfect for my conference trip! It was clean, safe and only a 10 minute walk from where I needed to be."
,,,,,,,,"More a pod hotel than an airbnb. Makes it convenient to quickly check in and check out but no community feeling at all. 

Great location"
,,,,,,,,"You basically get a bed and shared bathroom in a house where other guests come and go at all hours of the night.  The host company (offsite) was accommodating when we asked for cleaning to be done but we could not sleep and it didn't feel very safe.   Felt like an unsupervised hostel.  Good location but it you have other options I would recommend staying elsewhere, especially if you value sleep.  "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed here for a business trip for 4 days and had an overall great experience. Read on for pros & cons.

Both the house & room are secure with codes for each. This is such a great feature when living with other guests so I felt more comfortable leaving valuables at home during the day. Hosts were very responsive with my questions. You have access to the rest of the house including a fridge & washer/dryer, but make sure to bring your own coffee cups. The location is very convenient for rideshare as it's close to downtown.

Now onto what could be improved: I wouldn't suggest walking around by yourself as it is not the best neighborhood, however I never felt unsafe as I used rideshare during my stay. The cleanliness could certainly be better as this is an older property, and my room was barely bigger than my bed! The showers also didn't have hot water half the time, and my bathroom sink would clog up during each use. 

Although there were some cons, it comes at a really reasonable price compared to hotels nearby so it's worth what you pay."
,,,,,,,,"Room was exactly as advertised. Other guests were noisy at times but Chris handled that. Housekeeper left behind an iPad with alarm that kept going off so between moist guests and iPad, I didn't get much rest the first night. But it got better.
Then my next neighbor said she saw a mouse! They said they would do some deep cleaning but I think they needed an exterminator!
Other than than, I really liked the key pads on the door. And the responses from Guesty were fairly prompt."
,,,,,,,,"I made a last minute trip Halloween weekend so I was just needing a place to stay close to downtown. Location was perfect and only a 15 minute walk to where my friends were staying downtown.  The room is small, but that's really all you need. It was clean, comfortable and did the job!  I really like how the rooms had the keypads.  I didn't mind sharing living quarters with other people. It was kind of cool, actually.  Uber is no longer in  Austin so I used Fasten and even on Halloween weekend, it was maybe $13 to get downtown.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"The room is a bit small. It can fit a bed and that's about it. Also we did not know it was a shared unit. It is also located on the more residential area of Austin. It is not downtown, as shown in the pics. 

Good value, though. 

"
,,,,,,,,Good.
,,,,,,,,Staying with Chris and Loni was great! The door codes were really convenient and allowed me to get around Austin without having to worry about carrying a key or anything with me (I went to ACL and this was super useful). 
,,,,,,,,"Really nice stay, place was easy to get to and the key pads on the doors were super useful. "
,,,,,,,,Great room right in the heart of downtown Austin! We were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to go. The room and house were clean & the listing was just as described! We had trouble getting in the front door initially but the guest service fixed the code within minutes and was super easy to communicate with! The code locks made it perfectly easy to access the house and our room! Definitely recommend the listing for others!!
,,,,,,,,"Muy bien Ubicado, El Barrio muy tranquilo, el baÃ±o y el apartamento muy organizado. Es como dice en el anuncio."
,,,,,,,,"Loved this space! Perfect location to get to downtown. It was an easy 13 minute walk. Simple and super comfortable bed with a great communal living space. I will definitely try to book this place again when I am in Austin, if it is available!"
,,,,,,,,Very cute room in a very convenient location. Thank you for letting us stay!
,,,,,,,,There was parking right there and the walk to the popular areas wasn't bad at all. The room was small but enough to crash after a night in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"The place was walking distance to 6th street and we enjoyed that part of Austin. It's an Airbnb community home so there was no real host present when we arrived. There were keyless entry locks on the house and the room-that made check in and check out super convenient. The bed was comfortable, however this room is very small. Perfect for an overnight stay, but may be crowded if you're staying longer. We met other guest and it was really nice to have immediate community. There were some issues with the cleanliness of the place. Since there is no actual host in the home, it seems some things were overlooked. Some other guest reviews may have a more thorough description. I didn't investigate or take my own pictures. I was busy getting ready to go see the city. The pictures do not accurately depict the home. Couches are more worn, room is smaller etc..,  I never contacted the hosts to resolve it because my stay was short. And I didn't particularly care. I was told by the other guest they were already bringing it to the attention of the hosts, so perhaps they had their own resolve. It has much more of a hostel feel than an immaculate vacation home. But hey. You get what you pay for. The price was higher the night I stayed but I would say it's a fair price at $45-50/night vs. an $85-90 quality stay. The neighborhood felt safe, and I was able to easily check out. "
,,,,,,,,The hosts use guesty which worked well overall and have combo locks for security which is a plus. I would recommend this place and it is near the film festival I was attending. The bed frame had a broken leg when I arrived and I called guesty right away. Guesty told me housekeeping would remove the frame and that never happened. I was able to sleep OK and the mattress was comfortable though the bed leaned diagonally toward the broken leg. I'm sure it will get fixed but I took off one point of my overall experience but still was a great place to stay.
,,,,,,,,It was good but small k 
,,,,,,,,Very easy to communicate with even though it's a place dedicated to travelers. Very prompt and willing to help with anything we needed. It's a great location in downtown Austin. Close to many places you'd want to visit while in Austin. Everything is as described in their description. Would stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Nice cheap place to stay within walking distance of downtown. The room is a little cramped, barely bigger than the bed, but if you just need a place to sleep and store your things while exploring it fits the bill nicely. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything I needed.  I liked the lock code door knobs to the house and private room. The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 is the neighborhood.  I felt very unsafe walking around the area. When I came home just before dark, there were 3 homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk one house over.  Great for the price!"
,,,,,,,,This was a fine place to stay and worked out good for 1 night I needed a place to stay in Austin.   It is a small communal living setup up.  The smartlocks for all the doors was cool.
,,,,,,,,The place was clean and good but not well located.
,,,,,,,,The host canceled this reservation 212 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
,,,,,,,,"Good & clean room + bath/shower.  Wouldn't call it awesome or chic, however a great value and walkable to Rainey St.  Easy process with Chris & Loni...all good!"
,,,,,,,,The room was tidy and cozy. We got exactly what we expected. It was a very smooth experience.
,,,,,,,,"Great house/location, as advertised. Lots of AC, which was fantastic in the Austin heat."
,,,,,,,,"The house was just as described in the photos. It was very close to Downtown in an area that is being revitalized. The house was secure and safe with automatic locking doors with a keypad entry. The furniture in the common area was clean, but worn. I didn't use the kitchen, but it appeared that others did. It had the feeling of an old kitchen that was surface clean. What bothered me most was a roach that was living in the cabinet, He was going in and out between the counter top and the cabinet itself. Would not have felt comfortable bringing any food inside, in fact chose not to. 

The bedroom was smaller than I was expecting. The photo seems to have a wide angle to it. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The only light that I could see was on the night stand. I did not see a switch for the overhead in the room. The bathroom was large and clean. The sink drain was inoperable. 

For the price, I would say it was OK. It met my basic criteria of secure and clean with exception of the kitchen. It was bare bones, with no TV or other entertainment. Honestly, for another $10, I would have preferred a budget hotel. The location was very good and convenient. The host were very responsive to questions and accessible. "
,,,,,,,,"Accurate listing description, great location near fun bars downtown, a 5-10 minute drive to fun places, and the house itself is homey with a well equipped kitchen. 

The other guests were very friendly as well."
,,,,,,,,Really good location near Medina st and not far from 6th and all the good spots in Austin.  I was able to book this rather inexpensive spot on short notice.  The smart locks made the check in/out really easy and parking was not a big deal.  If you don't mind sharing a bathroom and kitchen for a night or two... it's a good value... Thanks!
,,,,,,,,We loved how close this place was to downtown. Very close to South Congress St. and very close to many restaurants and attractions. The house was very clean and was a great stay.
,,,,,,,,"I just stayed here one night but it was just what I needed. Cute blue house, very comfortable, great location near downtown, and I met other fun travelers in the house. Went on a run and it was close to the river trail which was awesome! Great place - I recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,Chris and Loni were readily available and made checking in clear and easy. The bed was super comfortable and the amenities of the home were nice. I recommend their place for a comfortable stay and close proximity to downtown.
,,,,,,,,Awesome house and room; I'd caution walking back from the city at night but the distance is close enough for an affordable cab ride.
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience, so I was unaware that I didn't have to actually meet with anyone, but the service they use for help always responded very quickly. "
,,,,,,,,Close to downtown stuffs. Pretty bare bone. Thanks for the stay
,,,,,,,,"nice, convenient.  good location."
,,,,,,,,Good place close to downtown. Let me leave my bag in living room.
,,,,,,,,Perfect simple room. Clean quite house. Excellent location near downtown Austin. Without question I would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,What a wonderful home! It was cozy and safe and the bed was AMAZING!!! Definitely staying here again!
,,,,,,,,"Just about everything was great! I was in town for one night on a business trip. I got to the place around midnight, went to bed, and got up and left around 8am. It's a little bit of a weird setup - there are 3 (maybe 4?) rooms with unique key codes, and I never saw another person in the short time I was there. But that was just fine for me. The keypad system worked well, the place was nice and clean, and the few things I used (bed, bathroom) were comfortable. The location was very convenient for me needing to get to and from downtown, but it also felt like a pretty sketchy walk to do at midnight for the last 6 blocks or so - you go along the freeway for a bit, and then turn onto a pretty dark street before coming onto the block where the house is.

There were a couple things that I think could be improved - no deal-breakers, especially for the great price, and should be easy for the hosts to take care of:

* The air conditioning was way too cold! There was a thermostat, but I wasn't sure if I was allowed to touch it.
* The listing says there is internet, but I didn't immediately figure out what the passcode was. I didn't try hard, though, because I was mainly there to sleep.
* The welcome email I got was signed ""Julia and Guesty"", which I didn't figure out until just now was because the hosts are using a ""concierge"" service called Guesty. That was a little disconcerting and might be made more obvious in the email.

Other than these few quibbles (and a slightly sketchy location), the place itself is very comfortable and well set up."
,,,,,,,,"The price was the main factor and hosts were extremely fast and timely in communicating. Listing was accurate. Room was fairly small, but appropriate for the price. The neighborhood is typical of the east side, a stark contrast to the the glitzy downtown. It felt safe. The house was fine for the price."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, all the amenities, reasonable price. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"We decided on a last minute trip to Austin, and so glad Chris and Loni's place was available.  After we booked, Chris and Loni immediately reached out with all the information.  The house is extremely convenient to everything.  They provided some cool travel magazines that were current and relevant, and they had public transportation information available.  We had our own vehicle and there was plenty of parking.  The house is very secure, which we really appreciated!
We were in and out in less than 24 hours, but grateful for a nice place to sleep and shower.  "
,,,,,,,,"Exactly as shown, super clean, & easy to find. Enjoyed my stay here & despite all of the other rooms being rented when I stayed, I didn't run into anyone else & the common area was well  respected."
,,,,,,,,"The house was welcoming and everything you'd expect. Good spot for travelers. Although it was within walking distance to the fun areas, you have to walk through not the nicest neighborhood and then under a highway overpass with lots of homeless people to get there. If Austin still had uber, it would have been a much better experience. "
,,,,,,,,Loved the location! So close to downtown Austin. It made my first trip to town a great one. Thanks!
,,,,,,,,The host was patient and respond to our questions in the timely manner. The unit is comfortable and provide well enough than we need.
,,,,,,,,"The room was accurate as the pictures show on the profile. The room is small, but my boyfriend and I made it work (we only had one medium sized backpack). The clothes racks were helpful. The room and sheets were clean. We appreciated the clean towels left on the bed for us. The number lock system is a major plus - no need to coordinate check-in/key exchange. We had a rental car, so parking in the driveway was very helpful. The location was as described (walking distance to Downtown and Rainey Street). The bathroom wasn't the cleanest. There was hair EVERYWHERE - all over the floor,shower, mat, sink, etc. The shower wasn't the cleanest either and smelled bad. I agree with the reviewer that said this place sort of feels like a hostel. No host, just random people coming and going. I would suggest the host set quiet hours. As there was a couple staying next to our room who came home really drunk at 2AM (not a big deal), but they were very loud. They stayed up talking/hanging out in the living room (next to our room) until 3:30AM, after we asked them to please keep it down. The next day, a different person checked-in and was up showering and organizing things in their room from 3AM-4:30AM. Overall, our stay wasn't bad, but it also wasn't the greatest. If you're simply looking for location/convenience factor, this place works."
,,,,,,,,"The owners were very easy to work with and the room is exactly as advertised. The home is quaint with an open kitchen and nice coach/living room. Honestly, I spent most of my time outside of the house and the location could not be better! 10 minutes from the hip 6th east strip with bars, excellent restaurants, and clubs and the same distance from the must visit Rainey Street, a new and growing bar area. Austin is a beautiful city and this private room is exactly what is needed in order to explore the city."
,,,,,,,,"The house was very well maintained and felt very comfortable. Location was close to a lot of things, bit rough looking but not too bad. "
,,,,,,,,"Not very pleased with my experience. I had noisy neighbour situation, in which new shady couples would enter in early morning hours totally drunk and under influence. There should be some background checks done on folks before hand or intimation given on the code of conduct for guests.

My reservation was cut short by 1 day even after discussion on phone and confirming.I had to move out to another alternate RV/camper provided by the hosts which was so bad.
The Austin Police folks arrived on the alternate RV/Camper location and started asking me details on whether tax was paid by the hosts etc. Not a pleasant experience at 10 pm in the night.
I could not find switch/airconditioning details in the camper , since it was late at night.

The other things worked well -WIFI, Airconditioning etc."
,,,,,,,,Yes! It was clean and quiet. Great location and accommodations. 
,,,,,,,,"J'ai passÃ© une nuit chez C&L lors d un passage touristique Ã  austin.
 je retournerai volontiers Ã  cet endroit.
."
,,,,,,,,"This was my first time doing a shared space on AB&B. We were not planning on staying in Austin so needed a last minute place when we decided to add an extra day to our road trip. It was late in the day around 6pm so we chose instant book options only. We got access codes fairly quick. We were in room 1 which is a small room. What you see is what you get. The room only fits a bed & not much more(I think it was full maybe queen). We really only needed a place to sleep and shower so we didn't mind it that much. Bed was comfortable but does get a little hot like some memory foams can get. Shared bathroom with other guests. A kitchen, washer, dryer that we didn't use but was available. There were other guests in the house but we were not there for long and only saw each other in passing. It was really nice having the door codes no worries about keys. Messaged with the guy that works with the couple & he answered my questions promptly which I appreciated. The area seems a little sketchy at first glance but I never felt unsafe. Close to many things. Overall if you need a last minute budget friendly place to sleep & shower that's close to things this might work for you. "
,,,,,,,,The house was located perfectly for our evening plans. Just a short walk to the restaurant and to 6th street! Would definitely choose these hosts again.
,,,,,,,,The house is conveniently located and clean and bed is super comfortable .  Hosts are wonderful communicators !  Really enjoy having a combination lock on the house and each bedroom which lends to feeling of safety and security .Great Airbnb experience !
,,,,,,,,"Room was exactly as described. Nice and cosy. 
Close to lots of shops, restaurants, and nightlife.
Might be a tad bit too noisy for light sleepers, with all the code entering and such, but that's a tiny nuisance to what is aside from that, a fantastic place to come and rest your head."
,,,,,,,,"Place is great, would sleep at again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location and really easy to access, would definitely stay again! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"I didn't see the my host at all during my stay. I had no idea how to check out. I really liked the fact that the doors had codes on the door knobs. It made me feel really secure. The shower took a while to warm up but was awesome. The neighborhood may look shady but it's actually a quiet place and good to stay on. Within driving distance of downtown I wouldn't walk there though. My biggest complaint is that when it says cozy, the room is literally only big enough for the bed. So if you have a big suitcase with you it'll barely fit. Other than that this was a great place to stay for a first time air bnb user"
,,,,,,,,"As advertised, would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"Julia's place is very cute. The room is exactly as it shows in photo, and no bigger. The kitchen is clean and has all you need to cook. (You must bring any food, etc. ) 
The neighborhood is a bit dicey at night. However, it is just a few blocks from convention center. "
,,,,,,,,This place was as good as the reviews made it seem. The keycodes for the doors were very convenient and better than carrying keys around.
,,,,,,,,Perfect. Door. Code. Shower. Out. Home. Sleep. Leave as found! 
,,,,,,,,"Know before you go, but you should definitely go.

With the right expectations, you'll enjoy staying here.  One of the below reviewers nailed it with the 'automated hostel' description.  No one 'lives' here, just a rotating cast of travelers. I saw Jordan for about a minute on my last day. So you'll basically be on your own here, without much of the 'community' vibe that Airbnb tries to promote.

BUT - once you're here, you have all the best of Austin within a ten minute walk.  I loved exploring the Eastside (say hi to my friends at Brew & Brew for a great orientation to the best spots to eat and hang out), 6th street is easy to get to, and Rainey Street, my new personal favorite neighborhood, is all right there.

Street parking is, as of Feb 2016, free, but there are some signs about rezoning.  You won't need a car if you're just exploring downtown (we literally walked everywhere), and if you need to get a little further, every uber I took was like $5. Car can be helpful if you want to get out into the hill country (we went to Jester King brewery, super tight), but not needed at all. There is a driveway that was unused all week, I suppose it's first come first serve with the other guests.

If you can, I would stay it one of the other rooms at this house (there are 4).  This is by far the smallest, and the others are much more spacious.

Don't expect too much from the house, and you'll get more than you expect.  You're not coming to Austin to stay indoors, are you? Get here, drop your bags, and get out and explore!"
,,,,,,,,Quick  booking - easy to access the room/property with the key pad locks. 
,,,,,,,,"The location is very good. A easy walk to convention center and downtown. Easy to check in, no keys needed, just need a code the open the door, very flexible time to check in. The room is clear. Kitchen and bathroom are clear as well. I had a nice stay. Just the bedroom is small, no additional chair or table, but a nice living room available. Before my trip, I contact Julia, got Jush who works with her to response my messages. Jush is very helpful, answered all my questions, and made my 1st airbnb great. I really appreciate. "

,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed my two nights at this place and was extra appreciative since I had to book at the last minute and got an immediate response. Speaking of which, don't ever book with a guy named Jeddy who has a loft near campus. The bed was comfortable and the location was perfect. 6th Street was a short walk away and there is an excellent cafe called Cenote right around the corner. I also happened to meet two of the owners during my stay and they were both extremely friendly and welcoming."
,,,,,,,,"A real bargain.  One of the owners, Jordan, was at home the whole time I was there, and he was the perfect balance of friendly and willing to talk when I wanted to...and willing to leave me in silence when I was obviously working.  There was a noise problem the last night I was there, but I don't think that was Jordan's fault.  The room is barely bigger than the bed, but because of spacious shared areas (including full kitchen and spacious 3/4 bath), that was never a problem.  An easy 10-15 minute walk from the convention center.  Would definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,It is a really nice place comfortable clean and close to the city. I really enjoy my time their. 
,,,,,,,,Julia's place was in a great location. Less than a 15 minute walk to the lively 6th street. Lots of street parking available as well as a spot in the driveway. The room was small but clean/comfortable. Julia was very easy to get in contact with and everyone was welcoming. 
,,,,,,,,The house is a little run town but it's a very easy place to crash and very close to downtown. The neighborhood is a little unsettling when you first get there but you eventually get comfortable with it. The bed was comfortable but both the sheets and the comfortable were stained. 
,,,,,,,,"The place is an independent home turned into a hostel. You share the kitchen and restrooms with other visitors. About the place itself, it is conveniently located close to downtown. I got stranded without the codes to the doors and could only get that after making a few calls. The place is not as clean as the pictures portrayed. I could see hairs all over the bed, no wifi password provided. Overall, it worked but I can't say that I enjoyed staying there."
,,,,,,,,"I visited Austin with my girlfriend and we both had a really good experience staying at Julia's place. The location was great, everything was within walking distance and there were some great places to eat around the house. Julia was very helpful and responded very promptly to any questions I had.

The only downside was that the bedroom was a little cramped for two people with luggage, there was no room to stand or walk in the bedroom. But the living room was very comfortable for when we wanted to hang out in the house."
,,,,,,,,"Walking distance to a lot of cool bars and food options. Area can feel a little sketchy at night, but everything was fine. FYI--this is a communal house with other Airbnb guests staying here too. It didn't bother me, but I guess I missed that detail in the listing. The room is just as pictured, not a lot of space to put your stuff, but it worked for me. Overall, it was a nice place to stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Clean, quiet, comfortable. Thanks, Julia!"
,,,,,,,,This is a nice little room in a quaint little house near downtown Austin.  It was clean and the people inside were friendly.  I spent most of my time at a conference so really only slept at the house but I would do so again in a heartbeat. 
,,,,,,,,It was a small room but good to have somewhere just to sleep. We weren't at the house much but we knew our stuff was safe 
,,,,,,,,"Julia and Jordan's place is very nicely kept, wooden floored living / kitchen area leading into the bedrooms, two bedrooms sharing a nice clean bath with shower. The bed was comfy, and opening the window lets in fresh air. Access to downtown Austin is 10 mins by foot. Very warm host. Will stay again."
,,,,,,,,"The ease of receiving information from Julia in order to arrive and get settled was exactly what I needed after a busy weekend of wedding festivities. The home is in a trendy area of Austin and is only a short 15 minute walk to downtown Austin. The room is not huge and the pictures don't lie. I did not need anything more than a place to rest up so it was perfect for me. The bed was comfortable and I slept peacefully. The living area is spacious and the kitchen is accessible. Being a single female in an area I was still exploring, I felt safe at Julia's location. When I return to Austin, I will definitely stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"We were looking for a nice quiet place to spend the night after attending a show and wandering a bit late on 6th street . Found it !
Great location, very close to Downtown night life.
Clean (spotless bathroom), well maintained and exactly as described.
Keypad door locks (house and room) give you full freedom to go in/out anytime. Which is good since we did not meet any one else, host or guests. Communications with host prior to our stay was perfect, any question answered in a timely manner and information was accurate. Would personally recommend for a one-night stay like we did. Very good place for a reasonnable price."
,,,,,,,,"It was my first air bnb experience and it was a great one. I did not spend too much time in the house but was welcomed by Jordan and even provided with many tips about the local area.
Everything went very smoothly and I highly recommend the place. The location is also very close to 6th street, so an easy walk home at the end of the night."
,,,,,,,,"A small room, but just big enough for me being by myself, if there were two people it would be tight to fit suitcases in. It is in a great spot, a short walk to 6th street. It's on the other side of the interstate and in a bit of a strange area which looks a bit sketchy, but nobody bothered me. Was great for what I needed, a bed close to the a to the action for a few days."
,,,,,,,,"Had a great stay, would highly recommend it"
,,,,,,,,"Great place, peaceful, well organized.  They went above and beyond after I had a flight cancellation and had to stay for extra night on short notice... oh and there were free chocolate cupcakes :-)."
,,,,,,,,Second spot by this couple. Easy experience. Lots of great spots withing a 5-10 min uber. 
,,,,,,,,"Julia and her team from Guesty were very helpful in answering my questions promptly and made my first Airbnb experience a breeze. Checkin is so easy with the keypad locks which means there is no need to co-ordinate arrival times to get keys. Room was perfect for what I needed which was a bed to rest at night and a clean bathroom to get ready in the morning.  Location was great for me as i needed to be close to the convention centre and was able to walk there within 10mins. I had to do this walk in the early hours of the morning, pre 6am, and while it was dark i never felt unsafe in the neighbourhood. Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Julia was quite nice and friendly.  The room was small but adequate.  There was plenty of room in the house and the place was clean.  We stayed longer than most probably (8 days) so we saw several guests come and go.  Everyone was friendly and considerate.   We needed a repair on the toilet while we were there and it was taken care of right away!  I would stay here again if we're in town and in need of a place. It is located near a scrap yard so there was a bit of noise in the morning and the walls are thin.  I was glad I was not there alone as I would not have felt comfortable walking to the downtown area alone.  
,,,,,,,,Thanks for a comfortable stay! 
,,,,,,,,"The location of this house is great for driving around and it's very close for walking to downtown but we didn't try walking around due to heat.  The neighborhood is very quite with enough space for parking.
We didn't get to meet our hosts unfortunately.
What bummed us was the size of the room that barely took in our two small carry-ons and was definitely not enough for two people.

"
,,,,,,,,"Everything has been perfectly smooth and organized. 
Thanks for having us !"
,,,,,,,,"Didn't get a chance to meet Julia, but she definitely has a great place. The bed was so comfortable, there were towels, brita in the fridge, and the code entry to both the house and room was very convenient. Also a very great location. I went to one of the spots she has suggested and I actually met and made friends with someone from my small town! Thank you, Julia!"
,,,,,,,,Clean room and easy walk to 6th St. 
,,,,,,,,Julia did a great job giving me all the information I needed to be able to check-in before my arrival. It was easy to come and go and not too far from the rest of the downtown area. The house was very clean and felt very welcoming. It was great to have an affordable place to stay and a comfortable bed to sleep on after several long days at a conference. I would definitely recommend Julia to anyone else look for a place to stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,This was a great rental for Austin City Limits. The room and house was cleaned and offered everything that was needed for my stay. The key-less access with the door codes made it easy to get in and out without having to keep up with a key. Thanks so much!
,,,,,,,,"Location is perfect.  Close to downtown and everything in Austin.  The check in was so easy as you get a code to the house and your room. Super simple. Julia is super fast at responding to your questions and/or concerns. Price is very reasonable and the place was clean. You couldn't beat that price and location,  you can seriously walk to downtown. I would go there again. The neighborhood looks like it's up and coming so wasn't worried at all."
,,,,,,,,"The location was walking distance to everything I needed to do in downtown Austin. House on a fairly quiet street with access to great restaurants. The house is neat and clean with a big kitchen, comfortable common area and a clean, bright shared bathroom. It was a treat to be able to use the keycode system and avoid having to pack around a physical key. Julia's team was really responsive to messages and helped me out really quickly when the front door code changed and I needed access. It was nice to know that they are watching security and periodically updating keycodes. All in all a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"We had a great experience with Julia and although we did not get to meet her in person, she was warm and accommodating to our needs. The room was clean and comfortable- would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"Julia was very friendly,  the place was clean and in a great location. Definitely recommend "
,,,,,,,,"Cute, quaint little neighborhood.  The room was really cute and cozy.  I didn't see or meet the host, which was totally fine with me!  Wish I had the chance to spend the night in the room - I ended up staying over at my friend's place!  Would totally use it again.  The bathroom, living room, and kitchen were very clean.  No weird smell.  "
,,,,,,,,"Julia responded to all my emails super quickly, and always checked in to make sure I had everything I needed! Her home was lovely and very clean. Lots of space and nice amenities for a great price!"
,,,,,,,,Great experience! Host communicated well after booking was confirmed. Room was cozy and clean. Bed was also super comfy. 10/10 would stay again. 
,,,,,,,,"Very safe and comfortable stay. Room was a little smaller than expected but not unbearably so.
Met other guests and owners going in and out each day, but never felt bothered.
Will probably stay here on my next trip to Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Although I never met the host while there, there place was nice and quaint. In a good area and easy enough to get to."
,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed our stay - the location is just perfect, 5 minutes to the downtown. Host was very helpful, and the place is really nice. However there was one pretty serious minus - the bed. The mattress was uncomfortable, and its surface wasn't even, it had a depression in the middle. Apart from that, all was good. "
,,,,,,,,Very clean and close to 6th street bars. Code access was great to have.
,,,,,,,,I stayed at two of julias spots in east austin. Places were vey well kept and her and her people were very attentive. Def recommend her space.
,,,,,,,,The unit was exactly what I needed: a place to sleep and store my things near the heart of town. This place is dormitory style so be aware of that. But the place is very clean and secure and the host onsite was extremely friendly and so was everyone else. Great place. 
,,,,,,,,Good experience. Pleasant atmosphere. Easy to park.
,,,,,,,,"House was great, awesome location! Renting process was so easy. Fresh towels on the bed and cold beverages in the fridge (by donation). Great experience, highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"This is a good location, and the house itself is nice. My experience wasn't a superlative one, though. My room was right next to the front door which, rather loud when it opens and closes, interfered with my sleep.  On top of that there was a smell of pesticide in the house.  The host is kind and efficient.  There was some confusion about which room belonged to which person as well, and there was someone in my room when I arrived.  But it was cleared up quickly.  "
,,,,,,,,"Clean house, and easy access to Downtown. "
,,,,,,,,A lovely room and home within walking distance to 6th Street. Easy keypad entry. Clean and well organized. 
,,,,,,,,Close to downtown. A small but affordable stay!
,,,,,,,,Great stay overall. Comfy bed and nice shower were perfect after a night out in downtown; about 10-15 min walk to bars on 6th. Felt safe walking even late at night as there was still a bit of traffic in between; mainly pedicabs. There was confusion early on caused by another guest regarding the rooms but the host responded quickly.  Would definitely stay again.
,,,,,,,,"The house itself is in a great location - I could walk everywhere I wanted to go in Austin including the Congress Ave Bridge (for the bats), Barton Springs, the Capitol Building, E 6th St, and the SoCo district. It is very conveniently located for anyone going to the Convention Centre. The room is basic but comfortable, with a nice bed, somewhere to hang good clothes, two powerpoints, and a bedside table with lots of drawers. I was only there two nights so I lived out of my suitcase. The shared bathroom is clean and amenities are provided. The couches in the shared living room are comfortable too, and I didn't use it but the kitchen seemed well-stocked and was also clean and tidy. I didn't meet Julia but Also, there's a good cafÃ© (Cenote) just around the corner if you're looking for one. The description 'A nice little community of Airbnbers' is accurate, everyone was really friendly and the two guys staying in the room opposite mine were good dudes who showed me around Austin and introduced me to Texas. I'd highly recommend staying at this property - so much nicer than a backpackers hostel, not too pricey, and a great way to make new friends if you know no one in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Nice little house convenient to some good bars and food spots. 
,,,,,,,,"Really clean, and efficient, shame I couldn't actually stay for longer."
,,,,,,,,"Did not personally meet the host, but contact was sufficient and all my informational needs regarding the room were met completely. Good location, very close to downtown and 6th street and several trendy bars and restaurants. One potential problem is the house located near a metal scrapyard that gets quite loud on weekdays morning so take this into consideration if you're a light sleeper who wants to sleep in. The room is slightly small for two people but cute and the house itself is very clean and nice. The bathroom was clean and everyone was great about the house. Overall a good room because of the value and the great location and I would rebook in the future."
,,,,,,,,Julia was accommodating despite having to be moved due  to the flash floods in texas. She addressed all concerns timeously. Room was clean and comfortable. Julia doesn't stay in the house but it is shared with other air bnbs and was great to meet other guests
,,,,,,,,Great multi room house which I really enjoyed. Very easy to access at any arrival time thanks to the coded locks on both the main door and the bedroom door. Appreciated the ability to get ice cold beers from the fridge in exchange for a very reasonable donation. Handily located for all the local amenities.
,,,,,,,,The house is a short walk from the Convention Center and is stocked with the essentials for a quick overnight. Julia is easy to work with.
,,,,,,,,"This is a perfect place to stay if you are going to an event downtown! I was in Austin for a concert at Stubbs, which turned out to be a very easy 15 min walk from our room. We were also in easy walking distance from a number of places to eat.

The house itself is lovely! While our room was small, mostly just the bed which was unbelievably comfortable, the main living room was large and comfortable. While we did not use the kitchen, but it was still nice to have the option!

The bathroom was also nice and towels were available for use in the laundry area. I'm a sucker for good water pressure so I was sold. 

I did not have a chance to meet Julia, but everything in the house ran so smoothly that it was not a problem. The keypad entry on the main doors and the room doors made me feel very safe.

I hope to stay here again next time I'm in the area!"
,,,,,,,,"Het verblijf bij Julia was goed verzorgd. Geen gedoe met sleutels, alle toegang elektronisch. Met heldere instructies. Julia niet gezien. De woonkamer/keuken en badkamer van het mooie modern ingerichte huisje gedeeld met andere gasten. Heel klein kamertje met goed tweepersoonsbed. Op  nog geen 10 minuten lopen van 6th Street! Vlakbij restaurantjes en supermarkt (7th Street). Alles goed verzorgd, van alle gemakken voorzien (goede keukenvoorziening). Een welkom adres voor stadsbezichtiging en ideaal voor sportievelingen zonder auto. Thank you Julia!"
,,,,,,,,Impersonal living space but did the trick. The house had great amenities.
,,,,,,,,"Positive:
The house really was in walking distance to everything Downtown. 10 Min to 6th or Rainey Street and also the Metro Station. So it is a great deal for the price compared to other rooms in Austin. Everything was well organized. I got the door codes for my room and the house in advance as well as a description in how to get there. They had coffee and milk and laundry included which was great as I continued travelling after Austin.

Negative:
It seems that the owners run the house as a business. It feels like you come into a hostel without a reception. There are many rooms and other houses they rent out on airbnb and Julia does not really live there. This was totally not what I expected from the decription.  I expected to get in touch with a nice girl called Julia who lives there, have a chat and find out whatÂ´s nice to see and do in Austin. Instead I found a sterile and not much welcoming atmosphere  - I suppose it depends what you expect when you travel via airbnb. The room was mini and the mattress worn out."
,,,,,,,,Second time staying in this room. Wish I owned it!
,,,,,,,,"The room was just as advertised and really easy to check-in. The room was right down the street from everything downtown and great for a quick stay in Austin!

Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,"Julia's room was perfect-- clean, in a cool, quiet location. We had a great time staying there!"
,,,,,,,,"Cool neighborhood, so close to everything downtown. Comfortable bed, easy check in. Just what we needed for a short weekend stay in Austin! Thanks, Julia!"
,,,,,,,,Although I was unable to meet the host the room was great and everything was as advertised. Overall really enjoyed my stay. Thanks again for the awesome place.
,,,,,,,,"This is the best experience you will expect from Airbnb. Comfortable beds, clean room, easy check-in, and nice host(s), what else? The rooms are a bit of small, but we are travelers, not top businessmen. And this place is 10x better than any of hostels which come with the similar price."
,,,,,,,,Really well situated (5 min walk from downtown Austin). No issue at all with the room. It was clean and the bed was great.
,,,,,,,,"My flight was cancelled and I needed a place to just sleep. Julia responded quickly and the check in is a smooth process. The room is very small but again, I only needed a place to sleep a few hours. "
,,,,,,,,"Great experience! Clean and comfortable.  Worked perfectly for running the Austin marathon - loved that I could walk to downtown and experience this cool city by foot.  Host was exceptionally responsive, always providing fast feedback. "
,,,,,,,,"Super accomodating host, handled my additional nights with no problems. It was a pleasure dealing with Julia."
,,,,,,,,"This house's location was PERFECT for my first trip to Austin. Traveling on a student's budget meant no Ubers, busses, or car rentals, so this location was just right for gals who walked miles and miles to get around every day. 

I didn't meet the host, but I very briefly met Jordan who lived in the house, and though he wasn't the friendliest when we arrived, he and his girlfriend were helpful when we asked for a recommendation. 

The room is small-- just like the picture looks-- so if you're traveling lightly with someone you can hang close to, then it's a great spot. "
,,,,,,,,Easy walk to 6th st. Great place. 
,,,,,,,,"Cozy, comfortable bed! Affordable and welcoming. Thanks for the great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Clean, quiet stay. Walking distance to east side bars and restaurants. Towels left out for us."
,,,,,,,,"Awesome location, awesome place. Very private, with code access to both the house and your own room. I enjoyed it a lot. Wifi was great, and everything worked just fine. Julia was very attentive and sent me all the information I needed within minutes. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,The place was perfect! Close to town and cozy.
,,,,,,,,"Just as the description promised, an efficient room in a fantastic location. Julia left lots of helpful information for out of town guests and made the whole process transparent and easy to navigate. A great place for exploring Austin's East Side and downtown."
,,,,,,,,Thank you so much for letting us stay on New Years Eve! The room is small like it looks in the picture but in all honesty you get what you pay for! Its so close to everything that there is no need to spend time in the room so the size was not an issue. It was close to sixth street and perfect for our needs. The bed was comfortable with clean linen and fresh towels provided. The single downside was that the shower would not get hot.
,,,,,,,,"I'm a new user so for my first experience, I'll say it was just ok. House is quaint and location is perfect. We could hear people coming in and out of the house very clearly, waking us up super late...and super early. Kitchen is not complete and is under construction. No hot water in front shower. Booking and paying was super easy and they had the place ready for us on the fly. That being said, it was definitely more of a transactional experience. Not bad, but not ideal. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location, within walking distance of downtown Austin. Lots of free street parking available. The room is small, but sufficient."
,,,,,,,,Me and my husband stayed at Julias' place for three nights. The place was clean and cozy. There was a construction going on in the kitchen but that didn't bother us much. Our room was extremely small but the location was very convenient. 
,,,,,,,,"The loandlord is not honest. She confirmed me the room and address at the given date and time before my arrival at the confirmed address.
When I arrived at the confirmed address at the confirmed time, Julia Sousa told me the room is not available. "
,,,,,,,,"I can't accurately review this location because I ended staying at a different one, since the original place was being renovated. I will say though, that the new location was plenty adequate, clean and had a dorm room feel to it. With other young people coming in and out at all times of the day; it is a young town after all. Even though we were barely there (only to sleep) and I don't recall seeing our host, we really enjoyed the stay."
,,,,,,,,"This was not what I expected. This was a small house in a sketchy neighborhood. I chose Air bnb to avoid a seedy hotel scene. The person doesn't live there, and I don't even know if Julia is real. Someone else answers the phone. Rather than a quaint personal cultural experience, it felt like rental housing getting around the local codes. Austin's zoning requires that sharing economy housing be owner occupied. Not the case. They did let me leave my suitcase past checkout while I tooled around on my last day which was nice. It makes me worry about Air BnB quality in the future."
,,,,,,,,"Fair experience. The entrance was messy. Seems like some renovation was behind done. The room is too small for my taste. However, the location is central which is awesome.
The neighborhood is quiet and safe."
,,,,,,,,"Welcoming host, very good with arrangements, great location if you're looking for central Austin.  "
,,,,,,,,"The host was very attentive to my needs, recommending places to eat, places to shop, getting me things like an iron and ironing board. The neighborhood was nice, younger, kind of an artsy area. The room and house were clean and I enjoyed my stay. I was a physician in town for a convention that took up most of my time so this room worked out great especially considering hotels around the convention center were in 200-300 per night range. "
,,,,,,,,"The place was sweet, if you stay here you've got to hang out at all the local little food truck parks. There was a bit of construction happening while I was there, all good though, spent most of time in Austin at ACL. It was about a 45 min walk to Zilker park, which was what I wanted.

Short stroll into the city and a little bit of a longer walk south and you can check out the SOCO area."
,,,,,,,,"we booked this room last minute, we were very lucky! the check in process is really smooth, the room is tiny but perfect for what we were looking for (just a place to crash). We stayed just one night and it was great! "
,,,,,,,,"Check in was a snap, and Julia was more than accommodating with my late check in and check out times. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice, simple clean, friendly, conveniently located.
Close to convention center.
Had to leave a day early, but saved me money."
,,,,,,,,Very easy access to house and room. The house was close to downtown and it was on a quiet street with plenty of street parking. I had a pleasant stay.
,,,,,,,,"Julia and the crew have the process down to a science, and I don't think I ever waited more than 2 minutes for a reply to my messages. The checkin is extremely smooth due to the keypad doors, and the house is very well located. Just keep in mind that the room itself is pretty tight, but it worked great for my uses."
,,,,,,,,We had a lovely time in Julia's place. It was clean and very close to 6th. She was super friendly and accessible. Highly recommended! 
,,,,,,,,"Its a Great Place to stay, small room so if you have a lot of stuff not a room for you. But for me it was Great, would love to stay Again.  "
,,,,,,,,Everything was fine for my short stay. Missed one night due to delayed flight. Julia was quick to respond by text and phone when I had any requests and/or questions.
,,,,,,,,"The location is great as it is very close to I-35. I walked to the State Capitol in about twenty minutes. The place is well organized and the common areas are clean. The washroom was not very clean though. The room is small since the picture was shot from the door, so there isn't much space to work. If you plan on being out for most of your stay in Austin, then this place is awesome. The couple in the neighbouring room were very loud."
,,,,,,,,"We had a fantastic stay at Julia's place. The room was just as advertised, the house was kept clean through out our stay. 

Definitely recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"I didn't actually meet Julia, but Jordan who lives in the home was super accommodating and gave me some great pointers on places to check out while in town.  The location was a few blocks from the convention center, so it was easy for me to walk to/from my classes there every day.  The room was on the small side, which was fine for me as I was there by myself.  However I don't know how comfortable it would've been with 2+ people staying there.  I did love the key-less entry, super convenient.  Overall it was a great experience!"
,,,,,,,,"Location, Location, Location! This location is incredibly close to 6th street, but the neighborhood is a little sketchy at night if walking.  The photo shows a bright room with fresh/new bedding and table cover, but the actual bedding was more dated.  No biggie, though.  
Julie communicated quickly and effectively.  the home was clean and otherwise as advertised.  I was pleased with the value of the room, given the location."
,,,,,,,,"My experience was great! 

Julia and her team responded very quickly! This was my first AirBnB experience and it couldn't have been better. The room was comfortable and exactly what is pictured in the photos. 

Everything we wanted to see was within walking or biking distance from the home. I felt extremely safe in the area. 

I would definitely stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,Room is small but does the job. House is friendly and casual. Has that Austin ambiance. Residential neighborhood that is extremely close to downtown.
,,,,,,,,"Perfect for someone needing place to crash that doesn't mind the room's lightswitch being outside the room in the hallway, or having to shimmy sideways to get in/out of the bed (which was comfy enough). Bless the a/c which made it bearable. Confused about who ""Jordan"" was... notes on fridge thanked Jordan profusely, never saw him/her tho & this listing is for host Julia. Emails were mega-prompt. Rules were vague ""golden-rule"" style so not sure as Airbnb 1st timer if I was ""doing it right"" or not. Bit worried re my car on street as there were vagrants milling about on the block & 2x the police were arresting someone over my weekend stay. Very close to downtown/convention center on other side of 35fwy. Overall, place was tidy & offered bottled h2o on honor system. "
,,,,,,,,"The bed was a huge disappointment.  The first night we got back to the room late after a few drinks on 6th Street and the bedding smelled terrible.  It severely stunk of body odor.  The smell was all over the sheets, pillow cases, comforter and pillows.  It clearly had not been washed.  The next day we cleaned the bedding ourselves which removed the odor.  The bed was also very uncomfortable but that wasn't as disappointing as the inability to wash the linens prior to a new guest.  In all other aspects the place was exactly as listed and met expectations.  The two nights of awful sleep would lead me to not recommend this listing."
,,,,,,,,A really good place. I will stay again if I visit Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Nice place in a transitioning neighborhood - an easy walk to downtown Austin, where I rented a bike. "
,,,,,,,,"Nice room , bit too small , cool house "
,,,,,,,,Everything was great. Incredible response time.
,,,,,,,,"Proximity to everything cool is what is key here, however we found the pictures somewhat misleading (e.g. there is no bedside table in the bedroom like the picture has), and the place is quite threadbare, but other than that it functions very well as a base (with a great aircon system!) Would recommend as it is in walking distance to lots of great things.
"
,,,,,,,,Place was as shown in the pictures. Walked home from 6th street a couple different nights around 1-2am - didn't have any problems walking alone (am 30 yr. male). Would definitely consider staying here again. 
,,,,,,,,What a whirlwind my trip to Austin was! I was in town for conference and realized a few hours before I got on my flight from San Francisco that the first night's accommodation was not included.  Julia was gracious enough to accept my request at the very last minute.  The house is clean and tidy and in a great location (walk down to the food truck court on Cesar Chavez for great Korean food).  Julia was also super flexible with the check out time when I realized I faced major ankle injuries if I planned to stand in the heels I packed all day and needed to make a quick shopping trip.  Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Chris was a great host. Comfortable bed, and close to everything including 6th street and public transportation.  Would recommend! "
,,,,,,,,It was great! Julia is very accessible and very helpful. The location is perfect for anybody attending a conference at the Austin convention center. There is a great coffee shop half a block away that is perfect for having a morning breakfast before a very busy day.
,,,,,,,,"Juliet was very friendly and helpful.  She offered many suggestions on what we could do in the area, and made sure we had what we needed.  About the house.  The location is perfect for visiting the city as it's walking distance from most of the things you'll want to do downtown. The location is the house's best feature. The room itself is comically small, but the bed was comfortable and met our needs just fine.  That little nightstand you see in the picture wasn't there when we were there. There's a little clothes rack you can hang clothes on, but almost no space to stand when two people are in the room. I left my stuff in the corner on the floor and put the suitcase in the laundry room as it wouldn't fit in the room. While we liked the place overall, this a place to use as a home base, not a place you want to stay in long.  The bathroom was clean and perfectly fine.  There were sheets and towels that were clean and ready to use when we got there.  Though we were nervous sharing the house with a stranger, we only saw Jordan (the man who lives there) about 5 minutes total in the 3 nights we were there, and he was perfectly friendly.  The walls of the room could definitely use some paint (that picture must have been taken a long time ago) but we did see Jordan talking to a contractor so maybe that's in the works. Also, a shirt of mine got pushed under the bed and came out covered in dust, so that should be cleaned. Short version: Great location; don't plan on spending much time in the house though.  "
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was nice, quiet and private. Didn't get a chance to meet our host, but she responded promptly to any questions we had. Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,Nice and mellow people - great location
,,,,,,,,"Juliet and Jordan's space is simple and well located. Hosts were courteous and provided copious suggestions. Would definitely stay again.
"
,,,,,,,,"Solid place to stay. Bed was comfortable and clean. Easy to walk to downtown once you get a lay of the land. Neighborhood was a little sketchy at night, but overall I would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,"The host was friendly and oriented me to the neighborhood and places to eat when I arrived. Air bnb message was the best way to communicate with him. The decor was minimal and tidy. The host sometimes works from home. The street is somewhat industrial with a scrap metal yard up the block. The house is walking distance to coffee shops, good food, bars, and downtown. I was in town for a conference at the convention center and this house was a convenient location- a 10 minute walk to the center."
,,,,,,,,Ideal location. Small room. Jordan was a very nice guy. 
,,,,,,,,"Jordan was a nice guy- very laid back and helpful for our last minute weekend in Austin. We had a great time thanks to some of his suggestions!

Thanks, Jordan!"
,,,,,,,,"First off, Jordan was an incredible host! He was very knowledgable of the area and had many recommendations to share with us. He also exchanged a few great and funny stories since his time in Austin. We had also met his girlfriend and his brother and both were very friendly and helpful with anything we needed. His place is in walking distance of Austin, especially 6th street. The room is pretty small with a mattress on the floor, but it worked for us. The bathroom is shared between everyone in the house but it was always kept clean. During our stay, Jordan was fine tuning a few renovations in the house, it didn't bother us at all. We would definitely stay at his place if we were to visit Austin again!"
,,,,,,,,"The house was in an ideal location, close to the entertainment venues on Rainey St and East 6th St. We had a last minute change in plan and Jordan was more than happy to accommodate us. The room however was a little small, nothing more than a mattress on the floor - this was adequate for our needs but do take note! "
,,,,,,,,"Jordan was really helpful and cool.  His spot walking distance from 2 of the coolest nightlife scenes in Austin (E.6th and Rainey St.).  Jordan was very accommodating.  He offered his beer and laundry facility and was friendly and warm throughout the visit. The room itself is pretty basic, just a bed and a lamp but when you're that close to the action of Downtown Austin, you won't want to be spending time in the room anyway.  I would definitely recommend this room to anyone who wants to check out the city on foot!    "
,,,,,,,,"I was disappointed with these accommodations, particularly considering the price. The pictures on the house's listing don't really convey that the room is extremely small (I'd say 6' by 8'), or that the bed is just a mattress on the ground. 

Perhaps I should have scrutinized the pictures more carefully, but the price ($70 for two people) certainly indicated that there should be more to it. Also, it wasn't really clear that it was a shared bathroom. That might be on me as a ""buyer beware"" moment, but if I were living there it wouldn't occur to me to rent out any part of the space, particularly not at $70 a night.

Some other points: The bed did not have a sheet between the bedspread and the comforter. I'll give the host the benefit of the doubt that he washes the comforter, but you should always have a full set of sheets on a bed.

The glassware was not particularly clean, and the living room furniture consists of a camp chair. This is very much a bachelor pad.


"
,,,,,,,,"Jordan was an accompanying host, meeting with us in short notice and offering a few free drinks to my traveling brother and I. The bedroom was tight and the bed was on the ground, but it was otherwise a fine place to sleep with clean sheets. 

There were no clean towels or toiletries included, which is typical of Ari BnB of this price. The location was the best perk, being in close walking distance of all the action. Overall quite pleased. "
,,,,,,,,"Jordan's place is awesome! He's in the middle of a remodel, so by the time you get here everything will probably be new and shiny.

The location is ideal, walking distance to downtown, Sixth Street, Rainey St, and Central East Austin.

It's great that it comes with a bike to use, it's a perfect way to see the city.

I clocked 24 Mbps download & 3 Mbps upload over Wi-Fi, which is solid.

Jordan is a really nice guy and super knowledgeable about Austin and the tech scene (he works at a fast-growing startup here).

Jordan's girlfriend brought over an amazing bacon quiche, that was really good. I wouldn't plan on your stay coming with quiche specifically, but it's the type of thing Jordan regularly does. He's a really generous host.

Also, I had to shorten my trip unexpectedly and Jordan let me change the reservation after it had started. That was really nice, he didn't have to do that.

I'd definitely stay here again, you should too."
,,,,,,,,"We had such a fun time visiting Austin, and this location was absolutely perfect for going out downtown. Jordan was such a generous host and eager to share his home with us. The house was cute, undergoing some repair work while we were there, but it didn't impact our stay at all. We would gladly come back."
383689,5,10,10,10,10,10,9,"Second visit to this great apartment, everything was very smooth. We love the location for exploring Austin and having a dedicated parking space is a nice bonus. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Austin. "
,,,,,,,,Great host!!
,,,,,,,,Great place! Perfect location - close to downtown. Well managed and organized.
,,,,,,,,"Excellent place to stay! The location is totally central to everything and Jamie provided a book of recommendations for restaurants/places to visit/etc. - very useful as we didn't have too much of an itinerary planned. Photos are very accurate, gated parking and washer/dryer were huge pluses. Found the unit to be very clean (and I'm a clean freak:)
Would definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,Fantastic apartment in the middle of Austin. Short walk to all the bars on 6th Street and close to public transport. Highly recommend staying here. 
,,,,,,,,Great location near Austin's nightlife. Loved having an in-unit laundry room. Jamie was a great host and very responsive. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,Everything was perfect!
,,,,,,,,As described - good experience!
,,,,,,,,Great location. Parking is a plus. Easy to get to.
,,,,,,,,Great location! 
,,,,,,,,"This is a great rental - cheaper than some of the nice hotels nearby, but with the same great location. We were here for a wedding weekend and walked everywhere. "
,,,,,,,,I am a wonderful stay and the loft.  It was the perfect location a lovely place.  Very clean and equipped with all amenities.  I will definitely be staying here again next time in Austin!
,,,,,,,,Excellent. just lovely stay. WiFi was a bit slow for me but the place was close to everything..
,,,,,,,,Our experience was great! We stayed in Austin for my sister's bachelorette party and we were able to walk back and forth from 6th street which was great. The loft was super cute and was a prefect size for our group of 4 girls. I would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Anyone staying at the Austin convention center should consider staying here.  It was less expensive than the nearby hotel and Parking was included with easy in and out. The ACC is 500 ft walk.  For breakfast there is a coffee pot in the apt, a Starbucks across the street, and a blender and greens in the next block.  Many restaurants and 6th st within walking distance.  The jogging and bike path along the river is a few blocks away.  The only downside would be the spiral staircase.  The apt would not be suitable for those that cannot manage those steps."
,,,,,,,,Jamie's apartment was in a great location and an amazing value. Communicating with the host was extremely easy and would respond within a few minutes consistently. I'd highly recommend Jamie's apartment for anyone visiting Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"Great location, nice rooms, property manager was super helpful (as well as the hosts). Would stay again. "
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place right in the heart of Austin.  Check In is automated and easy which I loved.
,,,,,,,,"The location is amazing, it is within a gated community right in downtown, you can walk anywhere.  You couldn't get closer to the action.  It is a beautiful city and this condo fits right in.  My wife and I really enjoyed staying here and if we come back to Austin, won't hesitate to stay here again.  Jamie and her property manager, Margaux, were great.  Couldn't ask for better communication.  Thank you very much for making this available and our trip all that much more memorable.  You really couldn't ask for more.  Thanks again!"
,,,,,,,,We had an amazing stay here! Apparently the guests prior to our stay had made things a little difficult of prepping and cleaning but they were still snake to make everything happen in a timely manner and it had very little impact on our plans. Thank you for such a great night!
,,,,,,,,"It's a great location, right next to all the bars and restaurants. The apartment was great and everything was very easy to use. "
,,,,,,,,"Great loft in a great location.  The property manager is super responsive for any issues or questions that may arise.  The space is clean and exactly as described, would definitely stay here again! Thanks!!"
,,,,,,,,"Great clean, well equipped and well positioned apartment. Perfect"
,,,,,,,,"Everything super tidy, quaint and nice. Great location for anything convention related and much less expensive than the nearby hotels "
,,,,,,,,The host was very welcoming with everything you can think of.
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's place was centrally located and all around great! I really appreciated knowing that I could take the airport flyer to the condo, it was easy and definitely saved me a few bucks on a rideshare. The check-in details were very precise and super helpful, also loved that the building and the condo had keyless entry, very convenient! 

It was also very easy to reach Margaux, the property manager, with any questions or concerns. She was helpful and prompt with replies!

Overall very pleasant stay!"
,,,,,,,,Nice and cozy place that was very convenient to many places in Austin.  You could get around easily by walking or taking the bus.   Off street secured parking was very nice.  Jamie was a great host and provided everything we needed.  We would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's modern loft is the perfect location for my Austin vacation. Most of the downtown sites (including 6th street bars and restaurants) are within walking distance. Her place is also right next to the convention center. Her place is clean and all the important amenities are provided. Also, the dedicated parking space is perfect since I had driven to Austin. I will definitely stay here again and will be recommending her place to all of my friends! "
,,,,,,,,This was a great condo located in the heart of downtown Austin. The unit was very clean and the host went out of her way to get the place ready as early as possible for us. 
,,,,,,,,"I loved everything about this place!! Right in the middle of shopping, awesome restaurants, 2 blocks away from 6th street, less than 10 minute drive to South Congress. Overall, awesome stay and awesome place. Love how easy the accessibility to the building and apartment was. Loved that the hosts provided a binder full of recommendations on places to eat and visits (VERY HELPFUL!). I will definitely be coming back! Also, I liked the closet in the back full essentials just in case we needed anything else in our stay... I definitely felt at home. "
,,,,,,,,"Very good location.  East to access, clean, and large enough for 2 people."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Cute place. Great information left by the host!
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's apartment was perfect for our stay in Austin. It was clean, comfortable, and located close to Sixth Street, Congress Ave Bridge, and other attractions. I would 100% recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"I had a great stay at Jamie's apartment. I stayed a couple nights with two friends who came to Austin to visit. The place is nicely located and accessible to many of the great places downtown. It was great that we were able to walk each night to different restaurants and bars and not have to worry about driving or taxis. The reserved parking space in the apartment complex was also very convenient. 

The apartment also has easy check-in and check-out procedures, and Jamie is very responsive to messages. I would recommend this stay to anyone who wants to be downtown exploring all the great things Austin has to offer.  "
,,,,,,,,"Place was as described. Efficient check in and out. Overall, great stay."
,,,,,,,,"Overall, we had a great stay at Jamie's place.  The crown jewel of this space is the location: you're smack dab in the middle of it all. The space its self was very clean, nice and new. It was fairly quiet for being downtown. 
Jamie also provided excellent detailed instructions for check in and check out. Parking was a breeze as well.
The major downfall of this space is the furnishings. For the price per night, we expected to be a little more comfortable. The couch downstairs could use an (URL HIDDEN) was very sunken in on one side. The futon downstairs had little to no cushion and was extremely uncomfortable to the point where you could feel the metal support bars while you were sleeping. The upstairs bed wasn't much better. You could hear the springs creaking every time you moved and the mattress seemed to dip in the middle. The pillows were quite uncomfortable as well. If you're not an early bird, just be aware that the loft space in particular gets very bright when the sun comes up.

We had a decent stay overall and the issues with the furnishings didn't outweigh the prime location factor, especially since we were only there for two nights.

Thanks Jamie!"
,,,,,,,,The apartment is in a great location and has everything you would need. Super clean too. The hosts were very helpful and patient when I had a few check-in issues. Would recommend.
,,,,,,,,Great location and near alot of great attractions. The noise from college age kids was awful. Constant noise from 1:30am - 4:00am Friday and Saturday night. Needs a larger bed. The full size is a little small. No dresser upstairs so be prepared to live out of your suitcase. Spiral staircase is neat but getting up in the middle of the night for restroom is interesting. Secure safe gated parking and entry. 
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's apartment is perfectly situated in between all that Austin offers. We enjoyed being able to walk all around - to the hip 2nd street market during the afternoon to Dirty 6th later that night. The complex seems as if it is entirely rented out on Airbnb, which made it fun and interesting to talk with other visitors. "
,,,,,,,,They were very accommodating and had everything set up perfectly. Nice location close to a bunch of cool shops. If we're ever in Austin we would definitely try to stay here again. 
,,,,,,,,"The loft was just as expected!  Was a A little nervous about the outside noise but actually did not hear any which was a great comfort at night. It was very spacious and clean.  The location was perfect for the convention center and also for the downtown area. Cannot wait to stay again, our hosts were awesome!"
,,,,,,,,"If you can't tell from all of the other glowing reviews, these guys are true professionals as hosts, and the loft is beautiful. 

All of the guidelines, instructions, and recommendations left for us were perfectly clear and always helpful. It helped the whole weekend go perfectly knowing everything was taken care of and ready for us. 

The loft itself well looked after, clean, and made us feel right at home. It was within walking distance of everything that we could have needed or wanted all weekend. I would go back here in a heartbeat next time I'm back in Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie and Ben's loft is an absolute gem: we loved staying there.  It is spotlessly clean, very comfortable, and just really fun!  It's also blissfully quiet, despite being right in the middle of downtown Austin.  Communications were excellent from the moment we sent our request to book, and since entry is via keypad, check in and check out were very easy.  We also received our check-in instructions well ahead of our arrival date.  Our stay could not have been better."
,,,,,,,,A great condo in an amazing location. Would recommend to anyone!
,,,,,,,,Super cute Airbnb! Loved the bright colors and the spiral staircase. Amazing location. Air conditioning was comfy. Great experience.
,,,,,,,,Great place! We really enjoyed our quick visit. The apartment was easy to locate and all the instructions provided made entry seamless. Would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay at Jamie's apartment in Austin. It's extremely well located - very close to lots of the nightlife and other key sites. The apartment is beautifully decorated and can comfortably sleep four people, though given the layout (one bedroom upstairs and a large open living room space), it's probably best for a family rather than two couples or friends. There isn't much privacy in the sleeping arrangements if that's important to you. Instructions for getting in and out are really clear and the apartment is well stocked. "
,,,,,,,,"This loft is exactly what I was looking for, location, clean and convenient.  Everything was exactly as advertised, and the bed is very comfortable.  The detailed instructions are specific and very helpful.  Highly recommend.  "
,,,,,,,,"Great service, clean place, great downtown location.  "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was super responsive to all questions and got back to me promptly. Loft was exactly as described. Located within walking distance of 6th street and other amenities, it was the perfect spot for us to stay. Definitely a cozy place for 2-4 people and would stay here again. Thanks again for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"I always stay at AirBnB  for conferences, and have had good luck so far.  However, I struck out on this one. The location is convenient for meetings at the conference center, however it leaves a lot to be desired, especially for the price. Since it costs the same as the surrounding  conference hotels (if you factor in the conference discount), I expected to have at a minimum, comparable accommodations.
1. The apartment is old with no elevator, and you will need to lug your stuff up two flights of stairs
2. The bedroom is up the stairs, the bathroom is down the stairs (those stairs are not fun in the middle of the night)
3. There was no coffee or tea or really anything in the kitchen (an old stick of butter, two beers, and some old Quaker Oats cereal bars)
4. There is a large semi-circular window in the loft and only small, gauzy white curtains that partially cover it. The surrounding skyscrapers shine light into the room all night
5. The pillows are the hard cotton kind one had as a child (and are probably that old)
6. The bed linens were old and worn out
7. The whole apartment needs a coat of pain and that picturesque red couch is falling apart
8. There is a TV, but no sound system, so if you want to listen to music, bring headphones 

Since an AirBnB doesnt have things like maid service and a nice big pool, one would expect that the price either be half that of the hotel or made up for in other ways. I would recommend just staying at the hotel.
"
,,,,,,,,The space was comfortable and in a great location for exploring downtown Austin. I'd recommend!
,,,,,,,,"Awesome stay in a great location. The loft is located in a location that allows you to walk almost everywhere you'd want to go! The loft was clean, useful, and cozy. "
,,,,,,,,"Great location with convenient keyless access to apartment and ground floor garage. Apartment  could use a deep cleaning and some freshening up. Broken couch, weathered/dingy throw rugs and bath mat, no toilet paper holder. Although we were strongly advised about fines that would be levied for noise created in the outdoor area and stairwells after 10:00 pm, the word does not seem to have gotten around. We were woken at 2:30 am on Thursday night by a half dozen exuberant 30-something guys drinking and smoking outside of their unit. The walls are apparently paper thin and the outdoor area magnifies and echoes sound. When it was clear that the party wouldn't be ending anytime soon, I dressed and went outside to ask them to take it inside. They were very accommodating. "
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay here. The location is perfect! 
,,,,,,,,"We only stayed one night, but the loft was just as described and we had a hassle free experience - no complaints. Location is right in the heart of downtown.  "
,,,,,,,,Can't beat this location. Easy keyless access is super convenient. Very simple check in and out. 
,,,,,,,,"We just traveled back home to Chicago yesterday after staying at our very first AirBnb and had an amazing experience.  Jamie has a lovely place in the perfect location in downtown Austin.  We were there for a wedding and had family/friends staying at the new JW Marriott and it was so close, only a block or two away.  We were able to meet up with them when needed and had the luxury of going back to the beautiful loft thereafter!"
,,,,,,,,"The hosts responded promptly, were welcoming via email, and provided detailed instructions for keyless entry, etc."
,,,,,,,,"My son and I stayed at the loft from a Friday afternoon until a Monday morning in order to attend the MotoGP event at COTA. Jamie was a great host and the loft was well-maintained and equipped. We loved the location, but we did have a problem with the noise. The building has many units, the building design and construction do not support adequate sound-proofing, and we were not the only ones who loved the location, i.e. ""guests"" were coming and going day and night. Many of them were also partying in the units with the doors and windows open and some folks were spilling out of the units into the corridors. Many of them seemed to be intoxicated and there was much yelling, singing, and carrying on in spite of postings to keep it quiet after 10 PM.  It went on until about 2 AM on Friday night and until about 4 AM on Saturday night. We were happy to leave early Monday morning so that we could get some sleep on our flights back to California."
,,,,,,,,"Cozy place, perfect for one or two people. No complaints, and loved the washer/dryer!"
,,,,,,,,"Location, Location Location! This loft is in the heart of it all with access to everything downtown Austin has to offer. Jamie was great to work with.  I will stay again."
,,,,,,,,The place was great! Clean and perfect location!
,,,,,,,,"Jamie did a great job letting us know what we needed to check in to the apartment and give us the information we needed to look around Austin   It was a great location downtown, easy walk to many bars and restaurants. I think her apartment is appropriately priced for the location and condition of the apartment. It was also great to have a parking spot, as the parking in Austin can be difficult at times.  "
,,,,,,,,Place was great! Convenient access to 6th. Would definitely recommend staying here. 
,,,,,,,,Jamie's apartment is absolutely perfect for sxsw or any other trip to downtown Austin. The location is absolutely perfect for getting around the town. 
,,,,,,,,"Perfect spot to stay in Austin!  Ideal location...  the loft has great decor, is clean and comfortable!  Wonderful experience! "
,,,,,,,,"This loft is located in a great location.  It is less than two blocks away from the infamous Sixth Street and hundreds of bars/restaurants.  It is also walking distance to many other areas of Austin, including Rainey Street, East Sixth Street, SoCo (South Congress), Zilker Park, the Texas State Capitol, University of Austin and more.  Some of these destinations you may wish to use a bike for a quicker commute.  We rented Austin's version of city bikes (B-cycle) during our stay and there is a bike station one block away from the apartment, which is very convenient.

The hosts were great, the apartment was clean and the check-in and check-out procedures were very easy.

We would recommend others to stay here for their visit to Austin.    "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was quick to respond to any questions we had, and also his property manager on site was easy to contact. The apartment was  clean and very nice inside. Very organized check in and they have a binder in the apartment with suggestions of things to do in Austin. Great location, close to 6th street along with pretty much everything downtown."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time! The accommodations were absolutely perfect and there were ample toiletries, towels and linens and anything else we forgot ;) Thanks Jamie!"
,,,,,,,,"Pro: Great location,  in the heart of downtown,  close to restaurants,  bars and shopping

Cons: Cleanliness is an issue, dirty, makeup stained sheets were in a ball on the bed.  Bathroom not clean, shower curtain has mold on it.   Updates like new paint job and thorough cleaning needed. "
,,,,,,,,We loved our stay at this airbnb! It was a convenient location and close to all the sights in Austin. It had everything we needed and we would not hesitate to stay here the next time we are in Austin.
,,,,,,,,Great place and location. The unit was exactly as advertised and delivered exactly what was needed.
,,,,,,,,"The loft was great! We were able to walk almost everywhere we wanted to go, including the LBJ Library, East Sixth, and the Graffiti Park. The loft itself was really well set up and has everything you might need. Jamie was super accommodating and was easily reachable. "
,,,,,,,,The listing description was incredibly accurate and the neighborhood was very quiet. I had friends staying in the same complex and we all raved about the accommodations.  Jamie left a sweet welcome note and some breakfast bars. I hope whoever is next enjoys the Delirium I left in the fridge ;) -Jes
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was great. The condo was as described and check in was easy! My wife had a conference at the conference centre right across the street. The location was excellent for us. 
Thanks"

,,,,,,,,"OMG! What a great loft! Close to everything downtown ATX has to offer. Clean, great decor, safe! Host was quick in responding to any questions. Great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"The experience was wonderful - the location was amazing, and we had 3 people sleeping here for a girls weekend. It was well stocked with coffee and snacks, and was immaculately clean and well taken care of. Also well stocked with paper products and shower supplies. Also, having access to the property manager was great during our stay - she was really helpful with suggestions of things to do and places to eat. I would recommend to anyone!"

,,,,,,,,Great place a hidden gem in Austin. Centrally located to everything. 
,,,,,,,,"The place was great, really close to 6th street bar area.  I was happy to find that the place is in fact bigger than the pictures make it out to be.  Overall good experance.  "
,,,,,,,,"Stylish, spacious, clean, well-equipped, and centrally located downtown. This place was a dream, and Jamie was accommodating and easy to contact!"
,,,,,,,,"It's obvious there's a lot of care for the details in making this an enjoyable place to stay: the check in process is clearly detailed and easy to follow.  All light switches are marked with what they control. Plenty of linens/towels/toilet paper, etc.

The flat is in the heart of downtown.  We were never more than a $5-7 uber/lyft away from where we wanted to go.  Easy walk to 6th street without any of the noise."
,,,,,,,,"We had a very enjoyable stay at this loft. It was comfortable and in the perfect location for our trip. (We had an event at the ACC and it was right across the street.) I was also pleased that even though our trip took place over the weekend, it was quiet at night and we slept well. The process of accessing the loft was easy.  Jamie is an excellent communicator and a great host. I also loved having access to a parking spot and greatly appreciated being able to use it for a slightly extended period. If I am back for the same event next year, I will definitely stay here again! Thanks!"
,,,,,,,,Great room and overall experience!! Looked identical to the photos in the listing and was clean and ready for us to arrive. A queen sized air mattress was in the closet as well as pillows and blankets. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a great first Airbnb experience. The apartment was just as listed, self check in was a breeze and we couldn't have asked for a better location to explore Austin for the first time. Overall we were very impressed! "
,,,,,,,,"The loft was great! Exactly as the pictures stated. Jamie and Ben were great and gave us everything we needed for a great weekend in Austin. Menus of restaurants were put into a binder, bags were packed for grocery shopping and they even provided us with a snack upon arrival!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's place is a lovely apartment conveniently located in Austin (plenty of bars and restaurants nearby as well as B-cycle stations for bike rentals). The place was clean and has everything needed to make for a pleasant stay (dishwasher, large fridge, washer/dryer, ...). My friend and I had a great stay and I would recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Austin and looking for a central location."
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful time staying at Jaime's loft!  The check in and check out was simple. Her directions are easy to follow and I must say the location was perfect!  I would definitely stay again!
,,,,,,,,This is a great spot in downtown Austin!  The owner was very communicative with making sure everything was all set prior to our arrival and departure.  It is a safe building with code access for both personal entry and to park your car.  Would definitely return to stay again!
,,,,,,,,We felt very welcomed! The neighborhood was great! The location is great! 
,,,,,,,,"We really enjoyed the experience of staying in a downtown loft in the heart of Austin on 4th St. We had no trouble following Jamie's instructions to get in and took full advantage of the location to see the city from the street, river trail and kayak. The sleeping loft very cozy and we got a kick out of using the spiral metal staircase to climb up to bed. I would highly recommend Jamie's place and hope to stay again someday!"
,,,,,,,,"Austin is an amazing city and Jamie's place was right at the heart of it. Cool location, clean and easy. A few blocks from lovely 6th street. Was exactly the same as in the pictures, would definitely stay again."
,,,,,,,,"Our host Jaimie was awesome! While we never got to meet face-to-face the whole process from booking all throughout check out was thoughtful, comprehensive and easy.

There is a manual left for guests which includes a list of a variety of places to check out such as restaurants, shops and sight seeing. The condo is modern, clean and well kept.

Our favorite thing about this place was the location, its so conveniently located to a myriad of things for those visiting downtown Austin. Its also really great to have your own parking space!

Overall, me and my friends were very please with it and would definitely stay here again the next time we visit Austin.

Thanks Jamie!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Jamie could not have made it any better! First, the information and details provided were spot-on. We were able to find and access the apartment with no issues. Second, the location is brilliant. We were in the heart of downtown with restaurants, bars, and music venues all around. Third, the apartment itself is great and Jamie provided no shortage of amenities. 

I highly recommend Jaimieâ€™s apartment if youâ€™re staying in Austin. You will not regret it.

,,,,,,,,"Great stay in Austin! Perfect location, clean apartment. Entering the building was very easy. Thank you"
,,,,,,,,"The loft is great, highly recommended. It's laid out well, fully stocked and centrally-located near the action in downtown Austin, with a quick walk to East Austin for excellent tacos. Jamie was an excellent host and very responsive. I'd stay here again for sure!"
,,,,,,,,"The loft was centrally located to Everything in Austin.

Jamie was very helpful with all our questions about the city and the loft.

"
,,,,,,,,Fantastic location. It's within walking distance to anything you need. Literally right next to Convention Center if that's where you are having a meeting. The Courtyard Marriott is across the street as well as a Starbucks. The apartment is well kept. Stocked with all the necessary amenities. She has a booklet that tells you about the restaurants and bars. Really appreciate the quietness of the place and the convenience. The check in procedure is super easy. Thank you!
,,,,,,,,Jamie made us feel welcome and provided everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. The apartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures and the apartment community was cosy and welcoming.
,,,,,,,,#NAME?
,,,,,,,,"The loft home was exactly as pictured.  Easy self check-in and all the amenities you need.  Being on the courtyard side, it reduced the noise of the busy downtown area.  The location was perfect and the parking space was a huge bonus.   I had a question on my stay and Jamie quickly responded.  Thanks for the hospitality."
,,,,,,,,Great location and great space. Had a great time and highly recommend to others. Location is really hard to beat if you are looking for a place nearby 6th street!
,,,,,,,,This was our first AirBnB experience and it was terrific! Perfect location to walk everywhere! Very clean. Great keypad entry with parking space. Would stay again :)
,,,,,,,,"This spot was very convenient for attending the convention center.  Some things were provided, like eggs, coffee, etc., which was nice.  Jamie was very responsive to my communications and very friendly.  Instructions for entering and exiting the building were clear and simple.  I'd stay here again.  The bathroom door didn't shut and is somewhat transparent, but that wasn't an issue for us.  A towel can be draped over one of the door hooks if more privacy is desired."
,,,,,,,,"We had a great time at Jamie's loft on our last minut trip. The place was very clean. Location was perfect, easy walk to every where. Would stay again in a heart beat."
,,,,,,,,"Great location. On site manager was very helpful and accommodating. Unit was as described and comfortable for us. We found coffee,fruit and eggs waiting for us. We chose to eat out but the kitchen looked servicable had we opted to cook."
,,,,,,,,off the bat Jamie was very good a responding and answered any questions i may of had. the location of this place is incredible!

,,,,,,,,"Jamie and Ben were amazing hosts! Jamie was very communicative and made the experience seamless. The location of the loft was PRIME! It is walking distance everywhere and located between outstanding restaurants. I am a huge coffee person, and the Starbucks across the street was ideal. Jamie was a wonderful host and I'd suggest staying here! Again, great location! "
,,,,,,,,"Conveniently located, quiet, hassle free!"
,,,,,,,,"Stay was fine. Unit was very clean and in a very central location. All in all it worked for what we needed (36 hours in town for a wedding). 

The ceilings in the loft are a little low and the spiral staircase is positioned partly in the walkway, in a way that makes it easy to hit your head, which did happen. Bed was also a bit smaller than anticipated (double vs. a queen), though that is because I didn't read the description clearly enough! 

The TV did not work, which was disappointing, given I wanted to watch football during the break between ceremony and reception, but I managed and the property manager, Margeaux, was quick to get the ball rolling on a fix (which happened after we left). Jamie was very kind in proactively providing me a $10 refund for our troubles. 

All in all, this was centrally located and just fine for what we needed. "
,,,,,,,,"Cute loft in a great area! Thank you, Jamie and Margaux, for being such gracious hosts!"
,,,,,,,,"This listing is handled by a management company.  They were responsive to any requests I had and respectful of my privacy.

Checkin went smoothly and and was very straight forward.

Location was right next to the convention center and there was a Car2Go pod nearby that was very helpful for transportation around Austin.

The apartment was quiet and exactly as described.

That said it's only a short stroll over to a lot of awesome austin restaurants, bars, and lively night life.

I would definitely recommend staying here want to be down town."

,,,,,,,,"The perfect place to stay in Austin. Great location, cute and comfortable loft. Margaux the property manager was so sweet and helpful! "
,,,,,,,,Jaime was very responsive and accommodating.  
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was very friendly and had great communication. Everything in the house was clearly labeled and she had clear instructions in her house manual. The location of her apartment was perfect! It's walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants. My only complaint is that the bathroom door is partially see through and doesn't close all the way, which was a bit awkward."
,,,,,,,,"My stay at the modern loft was once again lovely. Check-in instructions were easy to follow, and I love that the parking is in a gated lot. Jamie and Ben provide everything one might need during their stay! "
,,,,,,,,"Lovely little loft with all we needed. The location is wonderful and I enjoyed the quiet zone in a busy area :-) The little bed in the loft is comfy and cozy...felt like staying at a friends house. Their onsite manager, Margaux is so friendly and helpful and everyone was so friendly!"
,,,,,,,,"We absolutely loved our stay in Austin and at Jamie's place. The whole booking and check-in process was so simple and when we arrived, the place was just what we wanted- clean, comfortable, exactly like the photos and in a great location! It was great to also have a carpark considering how in heart of everything we were. Would highly recommend Jamie's apartment! 
Thanks Jamie for a wonderful stay and for the welcome pack with all the great tips!"
,,,,,,,,Jamie is nice and very responsive! Her house manual has everything you need but she is also available by phone and text. The place is just as it looks. It was perfect for the one night I stayed in Austin and so close to 6th street. I definitely recommend it!

They were extremely accommodating and even let me leave my bag here after check out time on the day I was leaving because I had a later flight."
,,,,,,,,This listing was exactly as advertised. It was extremely close to the Austin Convention Center (right across the street). The staff on hand was very helpful and the hosts were responsive with my questions. This was a great experience!
,,,,,,,,Great spot! Would rent it again!
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic location - right downtown, within walking distance of shopping and restaurants, and close to the highway for easy access to other areas of Austin.

I'll be returning when I travel back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"This was a perfect place to stay in Austin.  The loft was exactly as described and it was stocked well and ready for my stay.

,,,,,,,,Fantastic stay. The apartment is a great size and had everything I needed while in Austin. Would definitely recommend.
,,,,,,,,Exactly as described. Great place!
,,,,,,,,"We loved Jamie's loft! Its gorgeous and perfect for 2 people. It's only 2 blocks away from 6th street, so the nightlife was amazing, even during the middle of the week. There are many good restaurants within a couple blocks, and Jamie left a list of them for us to choose from. This was byfar the easiest and most enjoyable trip I have ever had. Jamie sent a detailed list of instructions on how to access her space, as well as what to do when checking out, which made our trip much more enjoyable as we didn't have to worry about anything. On our last day I even left my laptop in the room after checking out, but her property manager was awesome and took it straight to FedEx to have it shipped within hours of us leaving. Awesome experience and amazing people. Stay with Jamie!"
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was a great home during our visit to Austin.  The pictures are a good representation of the apartment, and the keyless system is very convenient.  Our only complaints: it was awfully bright in the mornings in the bedroom loft, and my wife bemoaned the lack of a full-length mirror.  Still, I'd recommend the place for a visit to Austin, and it was great to have a parking space downtown. 4/5 Stars."
,,,,,,,,"Jamie has gone to great lengths to make her guests feel welcome by creating a guide her favorite places to visit and eat in Austin, and by providing a comfortable and truly unique place to stay in such an interesting city. The loft is in a great neighborhood in a central location downtown, making it easy to get to anywhere you want go during your trip. If you're looking to stay downtown, you should absolutely consider this loft."
,,,,,,,,The condo was just as described. Perfect for my son and I. Jamie was quick to respond and was a great help. I won't stay anywhere else when I travel to Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Place was great. Amazing location!  Didnt spend over $10 in uber select ride anywhere we went in downtown for far away trips. Mostly could walk everywhere were we wanted to. Even to the capital. Very descriptive and easy directions for the check in progress, parking, and entry's. Jamie was incredibly fast with responses to which is a huge deal to me. Washer and dryer came in very handy for my trip across country. Would definitely recommend to anyone and would stay again in a heart beat. Can't even get a hotel for the price of this whole condo.  "
,,,,,,,,Nice apartment in a fun area of the city.  Pictures captured the reality of the apartment very well.
,,,,,,,,"Jamieâ€™s apartment is great! It was clean, quiet, looked like the pictures, and the AC worked well and keeping things cool inside.  You canâ€™t beat the location which is steps from the entrance to the Convention Center and a short walk to many fun music venues, restaurants and hotels.  Watch your head on the spiral stair case to the loft room. I had a couple of questions about the parking spot and internet which Jamie and the manager quickly answered. They are very helpful and accommodating. Iâ€™d stay here again and recommend it to others. "
,,,,,,,,"The unit was perfectly located, very comfortable, and the property manager Margaux was super attentive and pleasant. Would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,The apartment was clean and ready upon arrival.  The space is VERY SMALL.  It is a great option for a couple/2 people if you are going to be spending most of your time out of the apartment exploring Austin.  The location is great and has easy access to lots of things.
,,,,,,,,"Unit was very clean, comfortable and nice and close for what we needed. 

Only 2 dings against the unit.  One, the spiral staircase in the middle of the night was hard to navigate. Second, and more annoyingly, someone decided to power wash all the hallways and stairs in the building starting at 7:15am!  Rude awakening, although not a likely occurrence for every stay. "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie did a great job communicating with us and she was really responsive when we had questions.  The loft was as described.  The location was close to everything and we loved exploring the neighborhood.  We were provided with everything we needed - clean linens and towels, comfortable beds, and a nice big fridge.  Getting in and out of the complex was an ease and there were no complications at all.  The only issue we had was that the cable on the tv would go in and out (probably due to the weather/cable provider).  She was also very accommodating about leaving our bags the day we checked out, since we had a flight leaving later in the day.  I would highly recommend staying at Jamie's loft!"
,,,,,,,,Instructions were clear and we were made to feel welcome.
,,,,,,,,This loft was clean and comfortable and in a great location in downtown Austin. The information and instructions we were provided prior to our visit was helpful although the host did not respond to any of my attempts at contact following the initial reservation confirmation. We were able to get assistance from the property manager. The building is secure and removed from the street.
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was awesome! It was exactly as pictured. Great location with ease of access to both Rainey Street, 6th Street and downtown conference center and hotels. Perfect for business or leisure travel."
,,,,,,,,"The apartment was as described. Wonderful location as we could we could walk everywhere downtown we wanted to. Easy access to the building and apartment. Jamie was able to answer all questions that we had, once we were there we had no issues so we had no need to contact her. This place is located in such a great area that you do get a somewhat loud crowd during late hours walking in the street. It didn't bother us but I could see it potential bothering someone. Over all a great place to stay and Jamie was great to work with! Highly recommended! "
,,,,,,,,We had a great time staying here. Everything was as described and the keyless entry system on arrival and throughout the stay worked excellently. Margaux the onsite cleaner was very helpful and friendly. Location is great - close to 6th Street and the Colorado River. We would stay here again if we return to Austin.
,,,,,,,,Great neighborhood in walking distance to all the fun restaurants and bars on 6th street. We didn't spend much time at the condo but it definitely suited our needs! The condo was very clean! I recommend printing and having handy Jamie's codes for both the gate and door entrance. I would recommend this place if you're staying in Austin and want to be close to  all that 6th street has to offer! 
,,,,,,,,"The loft is very well decorated and in a prime location to most attractions in the Austin area. The communication with Jamie prior to and upon arrival was excellent. She responded quickly to all questions. Even with a couple small blips that were out of her control, she was very gracious and accommodating to rectify them. We would definitely stay here again when in Austin. Margaux, the property manager, is wonderful to talk to as well. Thanks!!"
,,,,,,,,We enjoyed our stay. Walked the two short blocks over for the 6th St experience. So convenient for that. Nice parking. Easy to gain entrance. Clean. Thank you.
,,,,,,,,"This apartment was fantastic! We had two people. I slept on the futon and my friend slept upstairs in the loft. The apartment looks exactly as pictured and the location is great.

We arrived during the last day of SXSW. We were right by most of the festivities. But we're also on the edge of a very nice part of town. 

Will definitely try to stay here again if I get back to Austin!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was very responsive to any questions prior to arrival. Once on site, her property manger was great! Very welcoming and happy to help with anything we needed. The condo itself was great. Unbeatable location for any events surrounding the convention center. I would recommend to others."
,,,,,,,,"Staying at the Loft was utterly fantastic -- we couldn't have asked for anything more during our stay for SXSW. Not only was it the perfect location, Jamie was a kind and attentive host. With food and booze waiting for us upon arrival, and on call support for internet issues (Time Warners problem not Jamie's) we had a seamless experience. I hope we have the opportunity to stay with Jamie again, she deserves the highest recommendation!"
,,,,,,,,"The place was just about perfect. You almost can't get closer to the Convention Center, which is what brought me to town. Jamie's communication was great, proactive, and very responsive."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, and loved the place -- it was a perfect launchpad for exploring Austin! Jamie's instructions were super helpful, as was her binder full of info and recommendations. Our group of four felt totally comfortable. "
,,,,,,,,Comfortable and clean loft in an unbeatable location. Situated in an ideal spot to make most city destinations just a short walk away. Checking in and out were seamless thanks to an experienced host. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Best Part: location! We were able to walk down to 6th street and have a great night in Austin.  Our trip was short, only one night, but we loved our stay here. We felt welcomed and comfortable.  Jamie's instructions were very detailed and left little to ambiguity. We appreciated that as hosts ourselves. 

Overall, this is a great place to stay! "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie made us feel very welcome.  The place was exactly as described and looks exactly as it does in the photos.  The location would not be beat.  We were directly across the street from the convention center and were only two blocks from 6th street, the heart of Austin's nightlife.  We are so happy to have booked here and would easily book again if in Austin.  I am so happy we chose this accomodation."
,,,,,,,,Really nice spot.  The neighborhood was great.  We were close enough to Soco that we could hop over there and could also enjoy 6th street with extreme ease.  Lots of shops and restaurants nearby.  Definitely would consider staying here again!  
,,,,,,,,The host is super welcoming and the place is as nice as the picture shows. I like the kitchen where I could even make simple stuff like fried eggs. Very positive experience.
,,,,,,,,"This place was great!  Located in downtown Austin, this was the perfect place for three of us to stay.  We were in Austin for the 3M Half Marathon and had a wonderful time."
,,,,,,,,"Our stay was brief, but we really enjoyed the fantastic location just off of 6th street. The apartment was beautifully decorated and clean, and we really appreciated the list of things to do provided by our hosts. 

Our only complaint was the noise level in the apartment during the night. We heard multiple conversations and even a fight! Other than this, A+. "
,,,,,,,,"Bottom line, I would stay in any of Jamie's apartments again. Three criteria to rate: people (5+ stars), location (5), and the apartment (3), total score is 4. Jamie and her on-site manager Margaux were just great. Because of scheduling, I wanted to have an early breakfast in the apt, didn't have time to shop, and even though they had never done this before, Jamie and Margaux purchased the ingredients cheerfully to help me in a pinch. (Margaux is a hoot, if you are lucky you will meet her) The location is just off sixth street where all the bars, pool halls, and hotels are clustered. Perfect. The unit was as advertised, but you may want to think hard about the layout. To get to the apartment you have to climb two flights of partially covered metal stairs and then across a long outdoor tiled walkway to get to the unit. Did I mention it rained during my whole 36-hour visit? The unit is well sized, and well stocked, but the layout is inconvenient. The bedroom is in a loft up a circular metal staircase, and the loft holds a bed, a side table, and a low book case. No closet, no armoire, no chest of drawers. There are some hangers downstairs by the laundry but not enough room there for the rest of your clothes, so I found myself going up and down the circular stairs since some of my clothes were upstairs and some down. Also, you can't control the loft light from downstairs, so at bedtime I had to go upstairs, turn on the light, then come downstairs and turn out the downstairs light (since I did not want to climb the circular stairs in the dark). Finally, the window treatments did not block much street light, though I slept fine. I don't think everyone would have as big an issue with the layout as I did, and Jamie was totally transparent about it, but I did not quite notice it during sign up, so I'm pointing it out to you.
One other point. This is my second Airbnb stay. My first was more of the ""classic"" experience, where the host was right there and we had a great time. Jamie is an ""Airbnb entrepreneur"", and does not live in Austin, so the experience is much more like staying in a VRBO vacation rental, with an absentee owner. I did not realize how much my in-house host added to my first visit. Again, Jamie was totally transparent about where she lives, I just had not thought about the difference and will in the future, and if you are a newbie you should figure out how much the interaction with the host matters to you. I found out it matters to me. You could not have a better absentee landlord and manager than Jamie and Margaux, nor a better located apartment. When I return to Austin I will look at this unit again, but will consider others too."
,,,,,,,,Loft was as explained and nice. The location was excellent and very close to many things!
,,,,,,,,"It's clear that Jamie is an experienced host: she provided everything that we needed and more! Jamie's place was perfect for my group of 4. The place is bright, colorful, and exactly as the pictures depicted. The instructions that Jamie provided via email and her hand-held manual were incredibly clear and easy-to-follow. So easy that I barely had to communicate with Jamie at all. There was everything that I needed in the house handbook - instructions to get to and from the airport (super easy), recommendations on where to go and how to get there, and super clear instructions on what to expect. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay! Great place in an awesome location! Thanks, Jamie!"
,,,,,,,,"The location of this place was superb!!! It was in the heart of downtown Austin, and not far from any place we went, on our 2 day stay. If you want to have a home base, and quiet space to for your down time, but be close to the action of the city, this place is perfect. No frills. Just a nice place to stay and call home. "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie did a great job making my friends and I feel welcome and making check in and check out as easy and convenient as possible!! The neighborhood was wonderful, walking distance from almost anything you would want to do while in Austin."
,,,,,,,,"Working with Jamie was incredibly easy -- apartment was great (centrally located, clean, easy to access) and we loved our stay."
,,,,,,,,Jamie was an excellent host.  The information he provided was comprehensive and the apartment was outstanding.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Jamie and his beautiful apartment to anyone wanting to stay in Austin.
,,,,,,,,"The loft was amazing, very well decorated and had everything you need to stay for the weekend or longer. Very clean and tidy. The location is awesome, walking distance from 6th. Im definitely staying here again. "
,,,,,,,,"We had a great stay in Austin. Jamie was very helpful, and the loft was just as we expected. The location to downtown, 6th street, the Colorado River parks, and South Congress couldn't be better. We were able to walk to many of the places we wanted to go. We would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Very easy, especially with the keyless entry.  Place as advertised.  Excellent location--near bars, restaurants, and town lake.  "
,,,,,,,,Great place to stay in Austin! This was my first airbnb experience and it was great! Super clean. Great location. Exactly as shown in pictures. Lots of great restaurants and bars within walking distance! Must try Max's Wine Dive! 
,,,,,,,,"The apartment is in a really fantastic location right in the heart of the city and right next to the convention center. With a bed, pull-out futon and queen inflatable bed it comfortably sleeps 3 (if not more). Jamie was very responsive and we'd definitely like to stay here again."
,,,,,,,,"Had a wonderful stay at Jamie's loft in Austin. Exactly as described, no surprises. Though we had no problems, I am sure Jamie would have responded quickly to resolve any issues!"
,,,,,,,,"Decent, comfortable space. Had a minor issue with the hot water but host resolved quickly; only other thing to note is that the bed will be a bit short for anyone over 5'10. Otherwise very centrally located and convenient. "
,,,,,,,,"Fantastic Place in a fantastic location, will definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in walking distance to the entire city."
,,,,,,,,"Our experience at Jamie's loft apartment was excellent.  The apartment itself was quite spacious with a full kitchen and bathroom, very clean and tidy, and perfectly located for the Austin Convention Centre.  Jamie was very professional in her dealings with us and we have no complaints!"
,,,,,,,,Had a great stay. 
,,,,,,,,Jamie was very responsive and a great hostess. The place is super clean and full of amenities. Location is superb and highly recommended for anyone with business in downtown Austin or the Convention Center. My stay was perfect and looking forward to staying here again. Thank you again Jamie :)
,,,,,,,,"Excellent place - especially for a convention.  Super convenient, right on the airport bus and rail line, walkable to everything.  Very quiet and comfy!"
,,,,,,,,"Nice location in the mid of down town, very nice and clean. Parking included. Jamie was easy to communicate with and every thing was as expected and seen in the description and pictures. Highly recommended for any occasion. "
,,,,,,,,"What a nice place to stay, thank you so much jamie, this place is in the ideal location, and the apt was very nice. I will definitely stay here again the next time i'm in town."
,,,,,,,,"I really can't say enough great things about the loft and Jamie!  As a host, Jamie has been super helpful, flexible and quick to respond.  The loft is exactly as listed and fabulously convenient for Downtown Austin and a very pleasant place to stay.  I really can't recommend it enough. "
,,,,,,,,What an excellent place to stay! This apartment was close to everything!  We stayed here for a conference and was able to enjoy delicious restaurants nearby and we were very close to an excellent jogging path along the river.  It was easy to Uber anywhere else we wanted to go also.  All essentials were provided. We'd definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Location was amazing, around the corner from so much. Anything you need to know is left in an amazingly detailed and convenient binder which we definitely used. When you even see all the light switches are labeled, you know you are with good company. I would highly recommend this property and host to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay, with everything you need.  The kitchen is stocked, extra towels and linens, nice TV and it's spacious.  Laundry detergent was a nice touch.  Light, bright, clean and only a few steps from the convention center.  This will be the only place I stay when visiting Austin in the future.  Jamie is very friendly, quick to respond and both her and the on site property manager make you feel right at home. Highest recommendation!  Thanks for a great stay!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was extremely responsive when I first inquired on this listing, finding me a yoga studio that is just one block away.  The loft looks EXACTLY like the picture, truth in advertising!  It's in a nice complex 1/2 block from the Convention Center and was such a nice treat to have a whole apt. to myself for the same price as a hotel room. I was here for a convention and everything was perfect!  There's even a washer/dryer which was needed after the hot yoga I did!  Will stay here again, you can walk to ""everywhere"" including the nice trail along the river and all the restaurants & shops of downtown.  "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's place was perfect. Plenty of space, clean, aircon ( a must because it was over 100 while we were there) location was close to everything. I don't have a bad word to say. Jamie was quick to respond to any questions I had, if I was to go back to austin I'd definitely stay there again. "
,,,,,,,,"Great little spot. Clean, close to some great locations. Highly recommend. "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was a great host. She was prompt with her responses and made communication easy. Also, she was flexible when accommodating different check in times, since I was flying from out of state. The loft was just like the picture showed, very clean and modern. The location was close to the heart of downtown and all the dinner meetings and activities I attended while in town."
,,,,,,,,Great experience.  Central location. Walk to anywhere. Clean and tidy kept and we couldn't ask for anything more. Would recommend if you are visiting Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Great location, great apartment. Perfect for anyone that wants to be close to downtown Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Jamie is a great host. She is very organized and responsive, having provided tremendous detail on her apartment's location, check-in and rules. I had no questions or concerns upon arriving at her place. Furthermore, the location is superb. Very close to everything that's going on in Austin. Would definitely recommend staying here. "
,,,,,,,,"Great place to stay in Austin! Amazing location. Jamie does a great job making guests feel welcome with a binder that includes details on the house, recommendations for nearby restaurants, etc. Bedroom gets great morning light. However, be prepared to go down the spiral staircase at night if you have to use the restroom. Love the location, and love that parking is an option, as street parking nearby is hard to find."
,,,,,,,,Loft was exactly as pictured/described. Location could not have been better. We enjoyed our stay very much and would stay here again! 
,,,,,,,,"The location of this place is perfect.  It's just off 6th street which makes quiet and close.  The neighorhood is safe and next to other hotels and condos.  If you're looking for place that is convenient for a few people, this is great.  Lastly, the decor is cool and they have a compiled a book of suggestions for places to eat, tours, bars ect..  It's very nice to have that local input.   4 stars for me because everything was accurate in the descriptions and the location was great for the price.  "
,,,,,,,,"Perfect setup if you are in Austin for a conference or just want to be close to downtown. Steps to the conference center and very close to most DT locations. Having a parking spot was fantastic too. Comfortable bed and well appointed apartment. Jaime's instructions were very clear. Didn't have a chance to check out the pool. Bathroom is on the ground floor with bed up in the loft, not a problem but you just have to be careful for midnight bathroom runs :)"
,,,,,,,,"Jaime was a wonderful host - she provided numerous suggestions for things to do in the area as well as convenient ways to get around town ; she also answered all of my questions very promptly. She was the epitome of 'southern hospitality.'

The apartment was very nice and in a PERFECT location in downtown Austin. Highly recommend for anyone travelling to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"Everything was perfect: the location, the loft, and the instructions. Jamie put everything we needed to know about the place and even had extra tourist info. Very well kept and I hope to stay again soon"
,,,,,,,,This apartment was very convenient for us. It was close distance to sixth and not too far from rainy street. The people at the apartments were very nice and i would definitely stay again. Apartment had a cute style. 
,,,,,,,,"Absolutely perfect! A great apartment, clean and smells great, better than a hotel. All the amenities, a kitchen, Plenty of towels. And the location can't be beat-- so close to 6th street and the bat bridge and even close to South Congress. Plus a parking space?!!! Perfect. Jamie was a great host and it's easy check/out. "
,,,,,,,,"This space was awesome! Wonderful and modern, and Jamie left so many nice extra amenities available for the guest. Really enjoyed this apt!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie did a great job of responding quickly (usually within 1-3 hours); the listing was as presented and very comfortable accomodations with recent updates.   Great neighborhood.... LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!   Walking distance to all places (music, food, and great entertainment).  Probably too far to Barton Springs on a really hot day, but...   Enjoyed the small, but nice pool.   It felt really good after a run or relaxing in the sun."
,,,,,,,,"What. Perfect location. Next to convention center, 2 Blocks  from sixth street- closes to  greats Bridge and River walk and lots of Restaurants. The loft is stocked with everything you need . Yoga Matt weights and all. The space and furniture nice . The one thing is 3rd floor and no stairs. Which was fine for me. May of concern for some. Great hosts ! Love to stay again.   "
,,,,,,,,"First trip to Austin Texas and first experience with AirBNB.  Both were great.  The loft was fantastic: Clean, Great A/C, and had everything you need.  It was super easy to find thanks to the great directions provided.  It is the perfect spot if you are traveling without a car: walking distance to everything downtown and far enough away that late night noise is no issue.  Well worth the cost. Plus with the Courtyard Marriott next door you can take advantage of easy taxi access.  "
,,,,,,,,"The location, right across the street from the convention center and within walking distance of everything you could need, is perfect. The building is clean and easy to access."
,,,,,,,,"The loft is exactly as it looks, but equipped with so many extras from laundry detergent to hairspray to beach towels, which I haven't found at other apartments. It had everything to live comfortably. If you want to be near the bars on 6th or Rainey, they are super close. Fantastic spot and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place. Jamie was always available when we contacted her. Great stay. Thank you for having us. "
,,,,,,,,"Love love love the place! This was my second time staying and I would definitely recommend the place. Perfect location, cleanly and Jaime is very accommodating!"
,,,,,,,,It was more that I needed but after a work trip it was nice to transition into an actual home verses a hotel room. The location was great and it served as the perfect home base of for my cycling adventures around Austin.
,,,,,,,,"Very cosy apartment with nice deco. Well equipped kitchen.  Location is excellent, very near to 6th Street. The check in and check out instructions were clearly communicated. Overall we had a pleasant stay."
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's place is even more beautiful in person.  Comfortable, clean, spacious, well-appointed and convenient to everything in Downtown Austin.  Arrangements were very easy and the keypad entry makes check-in/check out easy."
,,,,,,,,Absolutely beautiful! I would love to stay again!
,,,,,,,,"Nice n' clean. Superb downtown location. Easy access to bus stops and B Cycle racks made for an enjoyable, economical, car-free visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,I loved how simple the whole process was to get in and out of this space. Jamie was very diligent in answering any of my questions and her instructions were very helpful. 
,,,,,,,,"The loft was exactly as portrayed. We did not meet Jamie, but she left very good instructions on how everything worked, so everything was very easy. The location was great! The loft was very comfortable. Good experience overall."
,,,,,,,,Jamie's place was great! The location is perfect for walking the city and the sleeping arrangements were very comfortable. We will definitely look her up for our next visit!
,,,,,,,,"Everything was super convenient from check-in to check-out.  This spot was kitty corner from the bus line that goes to and from the airport which made getting to and from very easy, and it was very walkable to all the downtown sports.  I'd highly recommend staying here!  "
,,,,,,,,"Our host was very accommodating. The apartment was as expected. Clean and well kept. Location was excellent. Short walk to 6th street, 2nd street, and Rainey street districts. Bus to the airport was across the street. Very favorable experience. "
,,,,,,,,We had a fantastic time in Austin! The loft was as described and pictured on airbnb. Amazing location with 6th street bars right on our doorstep. Would definitely stay here again.
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's loft was absolutely perfect!  Everything was as described and the location was ideal- we didn't have a car but we walked everywhere...Rainey St, SoCo, 6th St, capitol building, etc.  Additionally it was a block away from the Airport Flyer ($1.50 to or from the airport).  It was the perfect apt for the weekend and I definitely recommend staying here!"
,,,,,,,,"Great experience, will definitely stay here the next time I am in austin. Loved this place as it was completely private. Jamie provided us with perfect directions on how to enter the property and left all the information we could possibly need on the counter upon our arrival. The location couldn't be better, although we had a car, it just sat in the (provided) parking spot the entire stay, as everything is within walking distance. Could not have asked for a better location. Finally,
The condo itself is beautifully decorated. Jamie and I apparenlty have similar tastes, and I loved the colorful decor. There are no door on the bedrooms so it important to be sharing this space with someone you are comfortable with as there isn't a ton of privacy. But I am not at all complaining."
,,,,,,,,"The location of this unit was perfect. 6th Street 2 blocks away. Walked to Rainey St several times. I received a bunch of helpful emails from Jamie/airbnb before my arrival with confirmation and check-in information. I noticed a broken blind on arrival and notified Jamie. She responded immediately that she was aware of it and had a new one arriving within a few days.  The unit was great for my wife and I.  The sleeper bed would have easily made the condo great for 3-4. Not much room for unpacking, especially if we were 3-4 people but it was no problem for us. 6th Street was very busy but the unit was very quiet. We used the convenient bcycle rental bikes several times (bcycle phone app)."
,,,,,,,,"Jamie and Ben's loft was exactly what I'd hoped it would be - well-equipped, comfortable, stylish, and in the perfect location. Catching the bus from the airport couldn't have been easier and Jamie's excellent directions helped me find everything I needed in the loft and surrounding neighborhood. Jamie thought of *everything* a guest might need - she even provided travel guides with updates and her own recommendations and notes. Such a gracious host! Highly recommended if you're looking for a place that feels like home right in the middle of downtown Austin."
,,,,,,,,We had a great stay in Jamie's downtown loft while in Austin for SXSW. It was an ideal central location to get around during the festival. Jamie was very accommodating and helpful with all of our questions. This was a great find late in the game for a place to stay during our time in Austin. 
,,,,,,,,"This was a fantastic place and Jamie was an incredible host.  The loft is cozy and fun with an absolutely perfect location downtown.  Jamie could not have been a better host--she was responsive, so kind, made everything easy and was very hospitable!  I can't say enough good things and would definitely stay here again or recommend it to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,"This was our first AirBNB experience. And it was good.

The loft is as pictured. The location and parking work well. Jamie was hospitable and responsive to my questions. Everything basically worked.

A couple things to know that aren't obvious.
1. The internet/wifi isn't very secure. It's the condo's wifi not the unit. We didn't realize that until we were there. Because of our need to work and have a secure connection, we probably would have opted for somewhere else if we had realized the wifi situation. We're very careful about our internet security and so this was a bit of a difficulty. 

2. The hot water heater was a wee bit small and didn't support two longish back to back showers. 

These really aren't complaints as much as FYIs.

Overall a very good experience!
st "
,,,,,,,,"I know Jamie's listing says Loft in the Middle of Austin, but it REALLY is in the Middle of the BEST part of Austin! We parked the rental car, walked everywhere, had an amazing weekend in Jamie's spacious and super cool loft! Short walks to shopping, restaurants, farmers market, capital, and nightlife. Everything you could possibly need is provided- great kitchen, glassware, linens and the complex itself is quiet. The only downside was not bringing my running  shoes and missing a morning jog along the gorgeous river walk just a minute's walk away. No better place to stay!"
,,,,,,,,"This wonderful, hip, cozy apartment was located literally steps away from the Austin Convention Center, which was hosting an academic conference that some friends and I were in town for. There were 5 of us staying in the apt, and we all fit very comfortably: two in the full bed upstairs, two in the queen futon downstairs, and one in the queen inflatable bed downstairs in the living room. There were more than enough towels/linens for all of us. Coordinating bathroom time (there was one bathroom) was only a minor struggle. The apt. is right in the center of everything, just two blocks away from 6th St. where all the nighttime action is. Super convenient! And the host, Jamie, was always very responsive to my emails and really friendly, as well as extremely flexible when I asked for different check-in/check-out times. All in all my best AirBNB experience yet! I really hope to visit Austin again sometimes soon, and if I do, I will definitely be checking availability in this apt. first!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's place was great. We were in town for a conference and it was very close to where we had to be every day. The loft had everything we needed and was super clean. Margo the housekeeper was great too. Our team of 3 stayed comfortably with one on a futon and the other on the blowup mattress (which was awesome by the way!)

Very close to the 6th street nightlife too. Great place."
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's loft was my home away from home during my week-long conference at the Austin Convention Center. My experience was great from beginning to end. Jamie's instructions were clear and thorough, she answered my questions quickly, and the loft was very clean and well-furnished with the amenities I needed. I often ate meals in the apartment, so I appreciated all the kitchen conveniences. I particularly liked the secure building access, gated parking, wifi, coffee maker (with filters), and the overall appearance of the outdoor area with its fountains and courtyards. The location for me was superb--literally less than a one-minute walk across the street from the Convention Center. This was a huge convenience during the week. Any time I need a place to stay in Austin, I will be looking for Jamie's loft first!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was very responsive and helpful.  The loft is the best location in the city, and was incredibly clean and organized.  Great Place!"
,,,,,,,,Jamie's loft was perfect! Directions were very concise and everything was very well organized and spotless. Couldn't imagine a better Airbnb experience.
,,,,,,,,Jamie's apartment is very nice -- located in the most perfect spot for getting to any place in downtown Austin. The apartment itself is very cozy and comfortable. We had a great stay here and would stay here again
,,,,,,,,"Jamie is great, really responsive, and awesome to deal with.  She has a great spot in Austin, and it made our first trip to Austin that much better.  Great location, and really comfortable place to stay.  Would return, and highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's loft was a great place to stay in Austin. The loft was spacious, well furnished and clean, and the location was excellent, close to all the main sites and areas in Austin. 

I would highly recommend the loft to others and would stay there again on returning to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,The apartment was beautiful and comfortable. We were so much closer to our conference than expected! The whole experience was perfect.
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's place is a perfect location. Everything is within walking distance! People are very nice and helpful, and I truly enjoyed my visit to Austin. Her place was clean, and she left a manual on what to/what not to do when staying in her place, which made it very helpful. "
,,,,,,,,"I stayed at several places around the U.S during my 2 week vacation, and this, to us, was the most beautiful place we were privileged to stay in. Located just a short walk from all of the action on 6th st., we'll definitely be staying here on further trips to Austin. Check in was made so easy and stress free, why cant every place on this site be more like this?!"
,,,,,,,,"Very cute loft. We ended up sleeping on the queen futon after the first night, since it was an easier trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night. The full bed is upstairs and bathroom is downstairs. 
Location is great, easy to walk to many bars and restaurants. "
,,,,,,,,"This place is in a great location - only two blocks from 6th Street and an easy walk up to the Capitol Building and across to the awesome food vans! The apartment is very safe, comfortable and spacious. The secure parking lot and the washer and dryer were great. The check-in/check-out process was a breeze. The hosts keep the place very well stocked with soap, toilet paper and paper towels which is nice, as you don't see that a lot in AirBnb places! We had a great time in Austin, and a great stay in Jamie's apartment. "
,,,,,,,,Jamie was incredibly helpful. The location is perfect for a downtown business trip. 
,,,,,,,,"Quiet, clean, great location, great hosts, cool place. "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place to stay.  The location is amazing - one block from the airport shuttle, a mile from the train station.  There's a cab stand across the street and buses three blocks away.  There are so many restaurants and clubs within walking distance you couldn't try them all in a month, and the Sixth Street strip is only two blocks away.

The apartment was very comfortable and clean, with a really comfy bed in the loft bedroom and a decent futon downstairs.  The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea, and everything you need to make yourself at home.

Jamie responded quickly to my emails and the whole thing was very professional.  I hope to stay here again!"
,,,,,,,,"Jaime's place was perfect for our stay in Austin! Our family of four stayed for three nights. With the bed, futon AND air mattress there was plenty of space for each of us. The loft looks exactly like the pictures, was clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay again!!"
,,,,,,,,"This may be about the best place to stay in Austin. Jamie was extremely helpful through the whole process. The condo was exactly as shown in the photos, no surprises at all. They were very accommodating with suggestions on things to do, some snacks for the morning and plenty of blankets, toiletries and places to sleep. It was honestly more accommodating than staying at a hotel!

The location was also fantastic. It takes a couple of minutes to walk to all kinds of great restaurants and only a 5 minute walk to 6th street. They even have a parking space you can use that is covered so no fighting for a place to park outside. It's also located next door to the convention center so if you're there for an event, just walk across the street. I would stay again in a heartbeat. "
,,,,,,,,We had a wonderful stay here. The location was perfect! A couple blocks from the heart of 6th street without the noise or commotion. It's across the street from the Marriott and Starbucks so cabs were ready and waiting! I highly recommend this loft for your next Austin trip! 
,,,,,,,,"We enjoyed our stay at Jamie's.  She was very attentive to any questions I had.  The location was excellent.  We walked to restaurants and sites in the area.  
The downstair's room is very bright at night.  There are two lights right outside the window.  
We would stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Great location, right across the street from the convention center. Excellent communication and hospitality. The accommodations were comfortable. If I need to stay in downtown Austin again, this would be my first choice."
,,,,,,,,Awesome location! Walking distance to the main attractions and cafÃ©s. Directions and communication leading up to check in was regular and concise. Apartment itself was clean and tidy. Would stay here again when I visit Austin in the future
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's place is great! I cannot overstate the convenience--it's a block from the convention center and just a few blocks from all kinds of great things downtown! The place is clean and adorable, and checkin/out could not have been easier. I would recommend it to anyone! "
,,,,,,,,"This is a great place! It has easy access to the downtown Austin scene and the neighborhood seemed safe even late at night. The keyless entry made for super easy access for multiple guests and check-in/out. Jamie was quick on communication and provided thorough instructions. The unit, although cozy, is well equipped. Recommended! "
,,,,,,,,This unit was great! I was in town for a convention.  The location could not have been been -- literally across the street from the convention center and near tons of restaurants and bars.  The unit itself was clean and cozy and provided more than enough space!  I would highly recommend for anybody staying downtown Austin!
,,,,,,,,"Jamie and Ben's apartment was a great place for our very brief visit to Austin.  I was in town with my string quartet and we needed to be within walking distance of the convention center and this is exactly where we were!  The apartment was quiet, clean and comfortable.  Jamie and Ben were very clear in their instructions and flexible with us when we had a slight issue with the sleeping arrangements.  I would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone's visit to Austin."
,,,,,,,,Fantastic place right in the center of town. Friendly neighbors... perfect location... and a private pool. What's not to like?
,,,,,,,,Jamie's place is amazing. The location is perfect for those visiting Austin.  Jamie is a very gracious host and makes getting into her place simple.  
,,,,,,,,"
Jamie's loft is perfect. Perfect location on East 4th Street with easy access to anything I needed - Wanderlust Yoga, Gold's gym, Rainey Street, spectacular food, kick-ass bars, smoothie bars, the Alamo Drafthouse Ritz cinema and the river were all within stone-throwing distance.

The loft looked amazing inside. Anybody who saw it commented on it. The air-con was a sub-arctic temperature. I can't comment on the TV, because Austin is way too interesting to stay inside. Jamie had condiments spare, if you maybe forgot something shopping. Ditto with some toiletries. She also left some great advice on bars and restaurants.

Halfway through my time there, Jamie organised her friend to clean the loft. Her friend cleaned it so well, that I was scared to even leave any mess after that. It looked immaculate. She ever did all my clothes and folded them, which was unexpected, but extremely generous.

My only wish for this place, is that I could have extended, haha. I think the local law makes you tap out after three weeks.

Although I didn't have any real contact with Jamie, she was as sweet as pie - everything was so well prepared and I was given tonnes of notice if anything needed to happen in the apartment. 

An overwhelmingly great experience."
,,,,,,,,Great location. Comfortable environment. Hard to not love. 
,,,,,,,,My first airbnb experience - and *way* better than i could have dreamt ! awesome host - kick ass venue and the location was magic ! i'll be back!
,,,,,,,,"This centrally located loft is ideal for a visit to an Austin convention, or, honestly, Austin in general.  The loft is very quiet, immaculately clean, and kept up well.  The host communicates promptly, and goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable."
,,,,,,,,"Couldn't have asked for better location, literally 2 minutes away from the 6th street and next to all the restaurants one may desire and the capitol building. Comfortably fit 3 people and very easy access to the condo and parking. Parking is covered and gated which gives a great feeling of security. If ever in Dallas, i'll be definitely staying there again!"
,,,,,,,,"Everything as described, had a great stay, Jamie was very flexible when I needed to check out late - no problems or concerns about the apartment, and the location is awesome. Thanks Jamie - will definitely stay again!"
,,,,,,,,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I'm so happy with the outcome. Jamie's loft was so cool and comfortable and is in a perfect location. Seeing as it was my first time using Airbnb, I had a lot of questions and was a little confused...but Jamie was so helpful and accommodating and emailed me back promptly whenever I needed help/had questions. It was also very reasonably priced, I would definitely stay there again."
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's condo in Austin was a fantastic find! We travelled from Australia with two children aged 4 and 6 and this was a great place to base ourselves. Right in the heart of town close to 6th street and transportation on Congress ave, as we were not driving. More than enough room for our family. We were only supposed to stay two nights however due to a change in plans Jamie's was able to accommodate us for an extra night. She was a great host, easily accessible if needed. Highly recommend this accommodation to anyone wanting to visit Austin. I've sure will be back! Loved it!"
,,,,,,,,"Great host - fast responses, thorough and accurate instructions for how to get there and the amenities, accommodations were great and as described. Great location - the neighbors are nice too! We had a great time and were very impressed by the beautiful loft."
,,,,,,,,"We loved our stay in the Loft. It's clean, fit 3 of us easily, and is in the best location in the city. Couldn't have asked for better accommodations in Austin! "
,,,,,,,,"Not only is Jamie's place in the perfect location -- around the corner from the heart of Austin -- but it's also cozy, comfortable, clean, and quiet. Jamie is a great host, very caring, responsive and attentive. She clearly loves this place and wants to be sure her guests love it too!  I'm looking forward to saying here again on my next trip to Austin. "
,,,,,,,,"The loft is a fantastic place to stay if you're visiting Austin! It's in the heart of downtown - close to 6th Street, restaurants, history and the capital. Jamie was extremely helpful and her instructions for the stay were easy to follow and made our stay stress free!"
,,,,,,,,"The Loft was a great place to stay during our time in Austin. Jamie was wonderful to deal with and our keyless entry to the loft made checking in and out super easy. The loft is located in downtown Austin near the infamous 6th Street. It is also a five to ten minute taxi (or 20 minute walk) to some of Austin's other trendy and hip neighborhoods such as East 6th, Rainey Street, South Congress.. great areas to shop, catch live music, eat, and people watch! I would 100% recommend the loft as a great place to stay as home base in this beautiful city."
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's loft is beautiful and in such a great location. It was well decorated, spacious, and spotless. I absolutely loved staying there and I hope to again in the future!"
,,,,,,,,Jamie's place is spectacular!
,,,,,,,,"Perfect location!  In the heart of Austin, Jamie's loft was clean, comfortable, and within walking distance to 6th St and SoCo district.  She also had some great food recommendations that helped enhance our Austin experience.  Great price, and highly recommended!"
,,,,,,,,"Jamie was a great host. She communicated detailed information in plenty of time, and we didn't have any issues getting into the apartment at all. She also provided us with a parking space in the garage which made traveling back and forth super simple.

Her condo is conveniently located in downtown Austin but within walking distance to SoCo, East Austin bar scene, and more. The apartment is clean and well-stocked.

I would highly recommend a stay at this place to any of my friends going to visit Austin soon."
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's condo is great - it is comfortable, clean and well-stocked with amenities. The location can't be beat! There's so much to see and do (and eat!) within walking distance, and if it's not, there are cabs at the hotel across the street. When you stay at Jamie's, you are truly in the heart of everything. Her restaurant recommendations were also spot on. Getting the keys was kind of an ordeal since Jamie was out of town and her usual key exchange method was out of service, but it all worked out in the end. "
,,,,,,,,"Great apartment in a very convenient location for walking to many downtown locations in Austin. You can reach the river and the ""bat bridge"" in ten minutes and the nightlife of 6th St in 5 minutes. The neighborhood around the apartment is quiet and the very comfy bed makes for a peaceful nights' sleep!"
,,,,,,,,Jamie's loft is in a perfect location downtown. We were close to a lot of restaurants and sights. Jamie was a great host making us feel very welcomed. I would definitely stay here again!
,,,,,,,,"Extremely central and fit five people comfortably. As a group of all women, our biggest complaint was that there was no full-length mirror, but other than that, our stay was perfect! The juice and yoga place across the street is awesome as well. "
,,,,,,,,Such a great location. Amazing Apt! Jamie was awesome. Just do it. 
,,,,,,,,"Jamie's apartment was fantastic. The directions were very clear and the apartment was clean, comfortable, spacious, and stylish. I was in town for a convention so the location could not have been more perfect. Walking district to 6th street meant you don't need cab fare and could easily stumble home after a night full of music. It's my new first choice in Austin. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,"A few other graduate students and I were in town for a conference. Modern Loft was perfect for the four of us. It was close to where our conference was held and is close to a number of great neighborhoods where we could grab a meal and/or a drink. The interior was clean and tidy and completely met our expectations. I highly recommend staying here!

Jamie is professional and helpful. Stay here if you want a pleasant and hassle-free stay in the heart of Austin."
,,,,,,,,"gorgeous loft, perfect location. "
,,,,,,,,"Great great deal.
A ++++"
,,,,,,,,"The pictures of the loft are accurate, and the loft itself is comfortable and convenient.  Jamie was very accommodating and quick to respond to messages.  I would definitely book this place again."
,,,,,,,,Overall we enjoyed our stay. The host did mention in the check-in instruction that voices in the hallway carry easily through the windows so I'd encourage any guest to bring ear plugs and eye mask. (We stayed over the mardi gras weekend.) The unit is on 3rd floor in an apt/condo complex with secured gates. Location is very safe and convenient where there are great restaurants and bars within walking distance. Our self check-in was easy and had enough towels to use. We also enjoyed ESPN channels.
,,,,,,,,"The loft was super cute and in a fantastic location in Austin. It was close to everything, and we were able to get around easily to all the great areas downtown without needing a car. Jamie was responsive and professional. Amazing deal for such a nice place in this perfect location. "
,,,,,,,,"Book it. Seriously, if you're thinking about staying here, do it! It's the perfect place downtown, easy to get anywhere (airport too - $1 bus ride), and has a very nice interior. It looks like an interior designer came into the place and made everything look great. Plus the hosts are professionals - they email directions, recommendations, instructions, everything you need for the trip, and it made the travel into Austin very smooth getting to the apartment. If any of my friends were to go to Austin I would recommend this place, so I highly recommend it to other airbnb-ers. "
,,,,,,,,"Back for another great experience at Jamie's modern loft.  This was my 2nd stay and it was even better than the 1st.  Jamie is all about service and making sure you enjoy your stay.  Incredibly accommodating and thoughtful with simple yet detailed instructions, great suggestions for experiencing Austin.  
If my family and I weren't closing on a home in Austin, I would def be back for another stay."
,,,,,,,,"jamie's apartment was very clean, well-equipped, and central.  it was a pleasure exploring austin!  thank you"
,,,,,,,,"Comfortable, Convenient and Courteous!
I travel to Austin each week for our business and I have to admit this Modern Loft is a great value.
The apartment is in a great downtown location, very safe, close to restaurants, entertainment, convention center, ACL, Children's Museum, etc
Jamie is a great host and provides all the comfy amenities with all the details and instructions on making your stay in Austin as flawless as possible.
I am now a repeat customer of the Modern loft at the railyard!!
Thanks Jamie"
,,,,,,,,"The place is great, with plenty of space to sleep three people. The location is amazing too, close to 6th Street, East 6th, Rainy Street and SoCo. Had a great time and Jamie's instructions were spot on!"
,,,,,,,,"This downtown loft was absolutely perfect for my recent business trip to Austin.  Location couldn't have been better and it was really comfortable, had everything I needed and it was very nicely set up.  The photos accurately convey what you find when you arrive.   Jamie is a great host, very communicative with a close attention to detail. Her check-in instructions were very detailed and accurate -- I never felt in the dark.  I'll be back!  Thanks, Jamie."
,,,,,,,,I liked this place.  The location is excellent and the place itself is cute and from my perspective a much better option than a hotel room.  Jamie was responsive as I had problems getting in as I'd lost the instructions and the whole experience was easy.
,,,,,,,,"we had the most wonderful time in this BEAUTIFUL loft. It is walking distance to EVERYTHING. I highly recomend this spot to anyone wanting to explore austin.Its pretty quiet so if you are going to party this is not the spot for you. Next trip if the loft is Avail. it will deff be where i stay.All in all the pictures do not do this beautiful spot justice. the Hosts were every nice and helpful and even called to check that we got in ok, very very nice people."

The apartment was spotless and they left a beautiful flower bouquet on the island to welcome us. The view from the balcony is extraordinary! The pool and gym were lovely, and the location was very convenient. Easy to walk to downtown and find fun activities! The apartment was beautifully furnished and the building is awesome. THANK YOU!"
,,,,,,,,Corey and Amanda were terrific hosts and always available for our questions.  They were even gracious enough to give us plenty of time to check out when we missed the time and inconvenienced them as they were preparing to spend the day at ACL.  Highly recommended!
,,,,,,,,"The listing was PERFECT -- I was in town with girlfriends for a celebration over the long weekend.  The location, the amenities (pool, gym, lounge, concierge), and the way the place is setup was exactly what we were looking for.

The hosts were very responsive and accommodating.  They even left us a bottle of wine, and it felt like we were right at home.  Will surely try come back, and I recommend the hosts and this listing with my eyes closed!"
,,,,,,,,This was by far our best experience with Airbnb. Corey and Amanda had very detailed instruction for check in and made it hassle free because we arrived late in the evening. They had everything we needed at the house was such a blessing to be able to stay here. 
,,,,,,,,"**HIGHLY RECOMMEND**Came to Austin with my boyfriend and another couple for a little 4 day getaway and had a blast! Corey & Amanda's apartment couldn't have been any more perfect. It was so close to everything. We walked to a lot of places and only a 5-7$ fasten (like uber) ride to 6th street at night. Right outside the apt is is where you rent kayaks/canoes/small boats. We rented kayaks one day and checked out Barton Springs natural pool. The next day rented a small boat and sailed up and down the river for a couple hours too which I highly recommend doing! The building itself is beautiful and smells great as soon as you walk in. Concierge downstairs to answer any questions, free coffee/tea machine in the lounge (best coffee I've ever had), free parking in the garage, and the Infiniti pool made us feel we were at a resort. They have outdoor grills, fireplace and television. The sky lounge had the most amazing view of the city. We sat up here prior to heading out while having a drink it was great. The key is in a lockbox outside the door which made everything so easy. We would just leave the key fob in there the whole time so we never had to worry about losing it. The apartment was immaculate. It had two balconies off each one of the bedrooms and living room with seating and patio table. They left us waters, bottle of Riesling, hangover drinks, beers, and there was a keurig! Two full bathrooms with towels and beach towels, shampoo/conditioner & body wash! Corey and Amanda just awesome and would text back immediately at all hours. I will definitely be staying here again next time I visit!! "
